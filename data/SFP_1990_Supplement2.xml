    <p>Mucllerius capillaris, frequency and lesions.</p>
    <p>The present paper summarize the results of three paper about the frequency of Muellerius
     capillaris on mekican goats and the study of their lesions.</p>
    <p>The material consisted in lungs of goats sacrifizied in the slaughterhouses from Tlalne
     pantla, Edo. de México, Milpa Alta D.F., and Ferrerfa D.F. The method was the observation and
     dissection of the lungs positives to Muellerius capillaris.</p>
    <p>The results were of 11592 lungs studied, were positive (6.17%) the places of the sacrifizied
     animals were: from Tlalnepantla Edo. de México 0.39%, Milpa Alta D.F. 5.76% , Ferrerfa 26.4%
     and the procedence was the following States of the Mexican Republic: Aguas calientes, Coahuila,
     Edo. de México, Hidalgo, Guanajuato, Guerrero, Puebla, Querétaro, _ Nuevo Leon, Zacatecas and
     Oaxaca.</p>
    <p>The lesions observed in the positive cases were: Nodules on pleura, eosinophilic infiltra
     tion, neutrophils, giant cells in alveoles, bronchies and bronchioles, hiperplasie of
     conjuntive tissue of pleura and hipertrophie of muscle. These lesions correspond with other
     observed in another countries.</p>

    <p>MURBIDLIY Ur MALARIA DUR ING 1985-1989 IN DUGANKENT AREA ADANA (TURKEWY) M. Akbaba, H,. Kasap
     and M, Kasap Cukurova University , Faculty of Medicine Department of Public Health and Medical
     Biology ,Balcali, Adana,Turkey Malaria, morbidity , Adana, Turkey Cukurova is a malaria endemic
     area in Turkey where malaria parasite is Plasmodium vivax and primary vector is Anopholes
     sacharovi.Each year more than 100.000 seasonal agricultural workers migrate to Çukurova from
     Southeastern Anatolia. These workers sleep outdoors without bed-netting and usually ommit to
     use the malaria drugs delivered .In 1985-1989, primiphos methyl was used for residual spraying
     and Abate (temephos) for larviciding. Personal proctection was also encouraged.</p>
    <p>Daraklor (choloroquine plus primethamine ) was delivered for chemoprophlaxy and primaquine
     for radical treatment.</p>
    <p>The malaria cases reported from Çukurova mostly belong to Dogankent area where,as in the
     other parts of Turkey, a significant general decrease was observed in the morbidity since 1985
     (i.e. in Dogankent 42.6 per thousand in 1985 and 4.4 in 1989); the morbidity was 56.6 per
     thousand in 1985 and 2.1 in 1989 in local inhabitants but it was 27,2 per thousand in 1985 and
     7.2 in 1989 in migrant workers, Percentage of positive malaria cases highiy increased in
     migrant workers as compared to local inhabitants during 1985-1989 (30.5 % in 1985 and 73.8 % in
     1989 in migrant workers, 69.5 % in 198$ and 26.2 % in 1989 in local inhabitants. Malaria was
     high in summer reaching a pick in July and occured whole year round in all sex and age
     groups.</p>

    <p>DISTRIBUTION AND CO-OCCURRENCE OF LARVAL CESTODES IN A FISH COMMUNITY Karin Andersen;
     University of Oslo, Zoological Museum, Norway E. Tellervo Valtonen; University of Jyväskylä,
     Dep. of Biology, Finland Keywords: larval cestodes, distribution, co-occurrence, fish Larval
     cestodes in fish are usually less host specific than adult worms and, depending on the species,
     often occur in several fish spe- cies. From earlier studies it is obvious that some fish
     species may harbour more than one species of larval cestodes. À priori one would, however, not
     expect that larval forms of autogen and allogen species should co-occur to a great extent in
     the same fish species. À great co-occurrence would mean a dead end to a large part of the
     parasite population of one or the other species. The same may be said about allogen species
     requiring different final hosts. In the present study a total of 5943 fish from 32 species were
     studied from the Bothnian Bay. For all the cestode species found, copepods are known to be the
     the first intermediate hosts. In theory one could say that most fish species draw on the same
     pool of cestodes (pool is used in the sense of Neraasen and Holmes, 1975). Larval cestodes of
     six species were found, two autogen species (Triaenophorus crassus and T. nodulosus) and four
     allogen species (Diphyllobothrium latum, D. dendriticum, D. ditremum and Schistocephalus
     solidus). Eleven species of fish were found to be infected with one to four different cestode
     species. Co- occurrence between autogen and allogen species was found to be rare.</p>

     seasonal periodicity of plerocercoids of Proteocephalus ritaii Verma, 1926 in Indian fishes,
     Sciaena coîtor and confirmation of zoonotic significance of Proteocephalus sp. in India was
     conducted during December, 1986 through November, 1988. The infection peaked in August
     followeli bÿ stealy infestation rate until May when the infection finally disappeared. The
     host's dietary habits and physiological behaviour played significant role in regulation of
     population Aynamics of proteoce- phalid plerocercoiïis in fish. The optimal temperature was
     25°C. The degree of infection Aeclinel with increase in alkalinity ani pH (&gt;7.6) but it was
     directly correlated with acidity. The infection also increased with increase in calcium,
     magnesium, phosphates, iron ani total dissolvei soliis in river water, but Aeclinei at increase
     in chromium content beyond 9.5 mg/ml as confirmed by functional linear regression. Multivariate
     analysis showel ominant influence of alkalinity in infection than hardness ani iron.</p>
    <p>The population distribution of plerocercoids exhibitei good agreement (P&gt;0.005) on Poisson
     series ani it coul fit in negative binomial molel. Experimental infections of larvae in albino
     mice led to evelopment of gravid worms at #0 days p.i., and the mature ani gravid worms were

    <p>Competition. Digestive microhabitats. Mullus. Trematoda.</p>
    <p>Eight species of Digeneans occur along the digestive tract of Red Mullets from Corsica.</p>
    <p>Purpose of the study: the knowledge of the microhabitat of all these species.</p>
    <p>Methods : counting of all individuals of each species present in each segment of the
     digestive system of numerous Red Mullets, in spring and in autumn, during two years.</p>
    <p>Results: Two Hemiurid species occur in original microhabitats, always deserted by other
     species : Aponurus laguncula (stomach) and Derogenes latus (gall bladder). All other six
     species are hindgut parasites. Pyloric ceca are very numerous in M. surmuletus, up to 25.</p>
    <p>Some of these are occupied by Timonia mediterranea (Monorchiid), some other by Opecoeloides
     furcatus (Opecoeliid). Individuals of these two species are never observed close together
     inside the same cecum. Poracanthium furcatum occur along the duodenum, from the place where the
     last pyloric ceca open into the gut. Three digenean species coexist in rectum. Holorchis
     legendrei (lepocreadiid) and two Monorchiids : Lasiotocus mulli and Proctotrema bacilliovatum.
     These two last related species use the rectal microhabitat during different seasons. In spring,
     the demographic strength of P.</p>
    <p>bacilliovatum is maximum, while the one of L. mulli is minimum; it is the contrary during
     autumn.</p>
    <p>Conclusions : Each Digenean species blooms in a peculiar microhabitat. Nevertheless, when
     biotic requirements oblige two species to invade the same microhabitat, a solution has to be
     found which avoid the interspecific competition. When the microhabitat is divided in several
     similar parts (ex. pyloric ceca), some parts are occupied by a species, some others by the
     other one. But when the microhabitat is not so diversified (ex. rectum), interspecific
     competition can be avoid by the selection of different occupation periods.</p>

    <p>INFLUENCE OF CONSTANT TEMPERATURE IN WATER BODIES ON THE BIOLOGY OF FISH PARASITES.</p>

    <p>Fish, Freshwater, Central Asia, Infestation, Temperature variätion.</p>
    <p>In water bodies of the temperature zone biology of fish parasites is under a high influence
     on seasonal changes of water temperature (Chubb, 1982 and others). Little is known about their
     biology in subartic and tropical conditions where the water tempe- rature is near to constant
     (Madhavi, 1979 ; Lopukhina et al., 1979 ; Chubb, 1988). As a model of this, water bodies of the
     temperature or subtropical zones can be used, which get the water suply from springs. This
     results in constant or near to constant temperature conditions. Two water bodies of such kind
     has been studied in Central Asia of the USSR (Danijarov, 1978 ; Bauer, Karimov, 1989).</p>
    <p>Conclusions of these studies are such 1 - Fluctuations of parasite infection of fish in
     habitats with constant or near to constant water temperatures are insignificant and are not
     under the influence of sea- sonal changes of temperature ; 2 - The parasites in these habitats
     can be devided in two groups ; these which in- fect fish directly by means of swimming larval
     (oncomiracidia, cercaria, etc.) and those which infect fish through an intermediate host taken
     as fish food. The parasites of the first group infect the fish throughout the year and
     fluctuations in occurrence are minimal. Infection of fishes by parasites of the second group
     may increase when the fishes eat more food.</p>

     France P. Malariae - Transmission A study on the transmission of Plasmodium falciparum and P.
     malariae was conducted in a West African village, near Bobo-Dioulasso (Burkina-Faso).
     Consecutive capture of mosquitoes, at night, on human volunteers, were organized twice a month
     during one year. In parallel, Plasmodium prevalences and densities were determined, every two
     months, in the same sample of children living in the village. Mosquito species were identified
     and Anopheles divided into 2 batches. One batch was dissected and the other tested in an
     Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA) to determine the species of the infecting sporozoites
     (P. falciparum or P. malariae). Anopheles gambiae and A. funestus, were the two main vectors in
     this area. During the first part of the transmission period (June-September), the most
     important vector was A. gambiae.</p>
    <p>The presence of A. funestus was especially observed at the end of the rainy season
     (August-December). 45 out of 787 A. gambiae (5.72 %) had sporozoites in their salivary glands.
     35 out of 606 (5.77 %) were positive for P. falciparum and 1 out of 606 (0.16 %) for P.
     malariae. 32 out of out of 722 A. funestus (4.43 %) had sporozoites. HO out of 563 (7.10 %)
     were infected with P. falciparum and 2 out of 563 (0.35 %) with P. malariae. The respective
     inoculation rates were : 250 infected bites per man and per year for P. falciparum and only 10
     for P. malariae. The relative importance of both P. malariae prevalences and densities in
     children, in spite of the low level of transmission is analysed.</p>

     Braack. Research Department, Skukuza, Kruger National Park 1350, South Africa Epidemiology
     Malaria War Refugees The long-enduring civil war in Mocambique between government troops
     (Frelimo) and rebel guerilla forces of the Mocambique National Resistance Movement (Renamo) has
     for many years resulted in the curtailment or cessation of normal health services such as
     malaria control in rural areas. As a result malaria is rife. Regular skirmishing between the
     rival forces and concommitant harassment of rural inhabitants, together with other factors such
     as drought and lack of basic commodities, compels many of these people to seek refuge
     elsewhere, disregarding international boundaries. During 1989 6119 persons of all age groups
     crossed into neighbouring South Africa to venture through the average 54km wide Kruger National
     Park to reach tribal settlement areas in mainly Gazankulu, while thousands more move into
     Swaziland and KwaZulu further south.</p>
    <p>Immigrants reaching the semi-autonomous tribal settlements - at least 150 000 in Gazankulu,
     KaNgwane and Lebowa - are provided with food, sanctuary and a presumptive dose of anti-malarial
     tablets. An average 8 - 10% of these immigrants are asymptomatic reservoirs of P. falciparum
     malaria, periodically increasing up to 30%.</p>
    <p>Such "imported" cases account for between 19 and 94% of annual malaria notifications in South
     Africa and have a profound influence on the epidemiology of this disease in the region.
     Although the Mocambican conflict shows little sign of abating, the political differences of the
     factions concerned need to be resolved before an alleviation of the malaria situation can be
     expected.</p>

    <p>Ancylostoma Immunity Trickle-Infection Epidemiology Ancylostoma ceylanicum causes chronic
     infections in hamsters which may be used as a laboratory model of human hookworm disease. When
     the hosts are infected twice weekly with varying doses of larvae stable worm burdens are
     recovered throughout the course of the experiment. Experimental immunosupression of the host
     has shown this to be immunologicaly mediated regulation.</p>
    <p>This probably prevents the establishment of incoming larvae at an early stage, as larvae are
     only found during the first few weeks of trickle infections. No peripheral eosinophilia was
     found at any time during these infections. Specific antibody titers were however raised after
     the first three weeks of infections and continued to increase throughout the course of study,
     “without stabilising as ïîs the case in primary infections. An understanding of the infection
     dynamics under the conditions of continuous exposure that occur in the field would have
     important applications in hookworm epidemiology. This study aims to simulate such exposure
     under JVlaboratory conditions where the under lying mechanisms may be studied.</p>

     Toxoplasmosis - Opportunistic parasitic diseases The author points out contemporary relevance
     of toxoplasmosis, belonging to the widespread parasitic infections in nature. The parasite
     Toxoplasma gondii is able to cause an acute, often fatal disease even in adult patients. At
     present clinical situation with toxoplasmosis is a specific one as to the patients with immune
     deficiency. Toxoplasmosis belongs to the important opportunistic parasitic diseases, especially
     in the patients with AIDS. Congenital toxoplasmosis becomes a rare form of the infetion owing
     early treatment in pregnant women with primary infection. The attention is drawn to the eye
     form that has much broader spectrum of symptoms, as is indicated by some recent papers. The
     treatment of toxoplasmosis is still a significant problem that is behind the contemporary
     diagnostic possibilities .</p>
    <p>There is no drug being able to eliminate toxoplasma cysts from the host organism.</p>
    <p>The significance of the infection is assuming a new character, which is a reason for still
     more intensive study of the mechanism of long-lasting survival of the parasite in the host
     organism.</p>

    <p>Nematodes, Sheep, Epidemiology, Tropics Monthly acquisition of gastrointestinal nematodes by
     tracer lambs on St. Croix was followed for 1 year in two flocks of sheep. One (AES) was an
     intensively managed flock, and the other (C/F), on an similar adjacent pasture, was less
     intensively managed. Each month 3 tracer lambs were grazed with the ewe flock at each site,
     then necropsied and gastrointestinal nematodes counted. Fecal egg counts were determined at
     approximately 2 week intervals for both lambs and ewes. Haemonchus contortus and
     Trichostrongylus colubriformis were the most abundant nematodes acquired by tracer lambs.
     Significantly (P=0.0006) greater numbers of adult H. contortus were acquired during the 4 month
     period of July through October than at other times. Significantly (P-0.0003) greater numbers of
     adult T. colubriformis were acquired from October through December than at other times and
     significantly (P-0.039) fewer T. colubriformis were acquired from May through August than at
     other times. There was no significant difference (P-0.85) in acquisition of H. contortus by
     tracer lambs at AES and C/F, but tracers at C/F acquired significantly (P-0.017) more T.
     colubriformis than at AES. Cooperia curticei, Strongyloides papillosus and 0esophagostomum
     columbianum were occasionally present, although in insufficient numbers for meaningful
     analysis. Ewes at both C/F and AES showed a significant (P&lt;0.02) lactation rise in fecal egg
     counts. Total monthly rainfall was significantly correlated (r-0.708, P-0.010) with the number
     of H. contortus acquired by tracer lambs, marginally correlated with fecal egg counts of ewes
     (r=0.513; P-0.088), and not correlated (r=-0.169; P-0.599) with the number of T. colubriformis
     acquired by tracer lambs. Monthly fecal egg counts of ewes was only marginally (r=0.555;
     P-0.061) correlated with the acquisition of H. contortus by tracer lambs and not correlated
     (r=-0.259; P = 0.415) with acquisition of T. colubriformis.</p>

    <p>Helminthiases - Control - Socicoeconomic progress-Italy In italy, agricultural workers
     dropped from 67% in 1881 to 42% in 1951 and, more rapidly, 10% in 1981. Women working in the
     services sector accounted for 11% in 1881 but 59% a century later. In 1951, 12% of the families
     had 7 or more members and 30 years later only 2% were that large. In 1981 78% of homes had one
     WC indocrs and 16% had two. Illiteracy dropped from 72% in 1881 to 4.6% in the South (and 0.6%
     in the North--West) in 1981. In parallel, ancylostomiasis, which was first described here 150
     years ago, and which was not completely contolled in the first half of this century
     notwithstanding a gocd legislation, imposed hygienic rules and chemotherapy of identified
     cases, disappeared about 10 years ago. Ascariasis and tricocephalosis, which had still a high
     prevalence in the countryside thirty years agc, were practically eradicated even without
     programmes of large scale diagnosis and chemotherapy. Along with sociceconomic progess and use
     of chemical fertilizers in horticulture, television-induced city ways of life even in country
     places played an important role in eradication. But strongyloidiasis survived in some rural
     focuses, and cxyuriasis persists. Rational breeding cf swine led to the eradication cf
     cysticercosis and alse pork meat - induced trichinellosis, which is now transmitted by
     consumption of raw meat of wild boar and horse.</p>

    <p>Dès l'arrivée des populations déplacées karens en Thailande, début 1989, le paludisme a été
     identifié comme le problème de Santé Publique numéro 1. Un programme de prise en charge des
     patients reposant sur le couple dispensaire-laboratoire a été mis en place par Médecins Sans
     Frontières dès le mois d'avril 1984. Un système de surveillance de la morbidité et de la
     mortalité par paludisme a été instauré dans le but de mesurer l'impact du programme de
     lutte.</p>
    <p>Les données recueillies sur une période de cinq ans ont été analysées. De 1984 à 1989, la
     population déplacée est passée de 9 000 à 20 000 personnes. L'analyse des tendances de
     morbidité par paludisme montre une situation hyperendémique avec un taux d'incidence annuelle
     de 1 067 °/o0 en 1984. Ce taux est de 600 °/00 en 1988. La diminution du taux d'incidence
     annuelle est particulièrement marquée chez les enfants de moins de 5 ans passant de 1 600 à
     760°/o0. 1 500 frottis sanguins sont lus chaque mois et la valeur prédictive positive d'une
     suspicion clinique est en moyenne de 45 %. Le plasmodium falciparum représente 80 % des
     infections. La létalité du paludisme au cours des deux dernières années de surveillance était
     de l'ordre de 0,30 %. Cinq années de surveillance montre que la lutte contre le paludisme dans
     cette région doit être axée sur le dévelop- pement des services curatifs et des
     laboratoires.</p>

    <p>Ostertagia circumcincta - Coproculture - Third stage larvae In order to study the influence
     of these two parameters under controlled laboratory conditions, 64 coprocultures were disposed
     in ovine faeces, macerated and free fron gastrointestinal nematode eggs. An average of 4356
     eggs obtained from macerated females of Ostertagia (235 females per batch), taken from ovine
     abomasa, was added to each coproculture. Ostertagia circumcincta predominated (93.4 %).</p>
    <p>Incubation was carried out at 4, 13, 26 and 35 + 1°C, with 80 and 100 % of relative humidity
     (r.h.). After 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 15 and 20 days of incubation, the larvae corresponding to
     each coproculture were obtained by using the Baermann method.</p>
    <p>The number of third stage larvae (L-3) per 100 incubated eggs ranged from O to 36 (X = 3.0 +
     5.0 s.e.). With 100 % of r.h., the highest number of L-3 was obtai- ned, at 4, 13, 26 and 35°C,
     after 15, 15, 6, and 2 days (3, 12, 36, and 6 L-3 per 100 incubated eggs, respectively). With
     80 % of r.h., the highest number of L-3 was obtained, at 4, 13, 26 and 35°C, after 20, 15, 10
     and 6 days (2, 5, 8, and 5 L-3, respectively).</p>
    <p>The variance analysis of the L-3 obtained at different temperatures showed signi- ficant
     differences (p = 0.0230). Though no statistical differences were found when considering the
     relative humidities tried out (p = 0.2098), lower numbers of L-3 were obtained in the batches
     incubated with 80 % r.h., and longer periods were re- quired.</p>

     "churra" race older than one year and kept in extensive regime were studied weekly for 27
     months. The animals came from different places in the province of Leôn (N.W. Spain). The worms
     were obtained by using the Taylor method.</p>
    <p>94.9 % of the sheep were infected. 805665 adults were chosen, 60.7 % of them being females.
     The number of Trichostrongylidae per abomasum ranged from 5 to 28735 ( = 1725 + 137.6 s.e.)
     Genera Ostertagia, Trichostrongylus, Marshallagia and Haemonchus were identified.</p>
    <p>Double infections (50.5 %) predominated over triple (31.3 %), simple (15.2 %) and quadruple
     ones (3.0 %). Associations Ostertagia + Trichostrongylus (85.2 %) and Oster- tagia +

     Trichostrongylus + Marshallagia (87.0 %) and Ostertagia + Trichostrongylus + Haemonchus (12.3
     %) were the commonest among triple ones. The absence of nixed infections by Marshallagia +
     Haemonchus, Trichostrongylus + Haemonchus and Trichostron- gylus + Marshallagia + Haemonchus
     must be pointed out. Simple infections by Ostertagia (88.7 Z%) predominated over
     Trichostrongylus (7.0 %) and Marshallagia (4.3 %). No simple infections by Haemonchus were
     found.</p>
    <p>When taking seasons into account, the order of generic associations was similar to the one
     mentioned above, except for the summer, when double infections predominated (58.7 %), though
     simple ones increased (21.3 %), and triple and quadruple ones decrea- sed (1.3 %). The presence
     of simple infections by Ostertagia, double ones by Ostertagia + Trichostrongylus, and triple
     ones by Ostertagia + Trichostrongylus + Marshallagia was constant during all the months of the

     OF GAMMARUS DUEBENI.</p>
    <p>By A.M. Dunn, J. Adams &amp; J.E. Smith. (Department of Pure and Applied Biology, University
     of Leeds.</p>
    <p>Animals from a population of Gammarus duebeni from Budle Bav, Northumberland are infected
     with a microsporidian parasite of the genus Thelohania. The parasite infects only ovarian
     tissues and is present in 20% of females and intersexes. This G. duebeni population has
     Environmental Sex Determination (E.S.D.) resulting in sex ratio biases throughout the year.
     Parasitised females are significantly heavier than unparasitised females and, although the
     brood sizes do not differ significantly, all the offspring of an infected mother develop as
     females regardless of the environmental cue. As parasitised females produce all female broods,
     the parasite would be expected to spread rapidly in the population causing a shift in the sex
     ratio torards a female bias. A programme of breeding experiments reveals the effect of the
     parasite on the individual host, on subsequent generations and on the sex ratio of the
     population. Factors which limit the spread of the parasite have also been investigated.</p>

     collections chiropterologiques, provenant de deux écosystèmes dans la province de Valencia (Est
     de l'Espagne), ont été examinés du point de vue parasitologique.</p>
    <p>La communauté helminthique totale comprend 12 espèces, dont 10 dépendantes de l'activité
     trophique de l'espèce hôte (parasites à des cycles biologiques hétéroxènes, dont 6 Trémato-
     des: Plagiorchis sp., Lecithodendrium linstowi, Pycnoporus heteroporus, Prosthodendrium

     glycirrhiza et Litomosa ottavianii, à des cycles biologiques respectivement monoxene et
     dihétéroxène, ce dernier avec des ectoparasites comme hôte intermediaire). Les données
     qualitatives et quantitatives selon groupes et espèces parasites et selon le sexe de l'espèce
     hôte, dans chaque écosystème, ainsi que leur étude comparée, permettent de constater, d'une
     part, les rôles régulateurs que l'écosystème et l'éthoécologie de l'espèe- ce hôte jouent,
     respectivement, sur les deux faunes helminthiques, dépendantes et non dé- pendantes de
     l'activité trophique. D'autre part, la saison de capture et surtout l'étho- biologie différente
     des individus de chaque sexe de l'espèce hôte, permettent d'expliquer les données quantitatives

    <p>S6.A 20 P.+0 RESOURCE PARTITIONING IN TREMATODES: THE ROLE OF THE FIRST INTERMEDIATE HOST
     J.C. Fernandez and G.W. Esch. Department of Biology. Wake Forest University. Box 7325.</p>
    <p>Winston-Salem, NC 27109. USA.</p>
    <p>Resource partitioning - Trematodes - Snail host - Sympatric species Resource partitioning
     refers to the manner in which various species within a community divide available resources.
     The outcome of resource partitioning may provide an indication of the role of interspecific
     competition in determining the number of species which can coexist within a community. The
     dimensions along which resources are partitioned can be measured in terms of habitat, trophic
     dynamics and time. It is within these dimensions that species competing for available resources
     will be segregated.</p>
    <p>Few studies have examined resource partitioning among parasitic organisms, especially at the
     multi-host level. Among digenetic trematodes, speciation events should be strongly constrained
     by the exploitation of different hosts in the life cycle. Since energy requirements during a
     trematode's life cycle are disproportionately higher in molluscan first intermediate hosts,
     speciation and resource partitioning among digeneans may well be driven and regulated at this
     level.</p>
    <p>Our evidence from the trematode fauna of the green frog, Rana clamitans, supports the
     hypothesis that congeneric trematode species segregate resources at the first intermediate host
     level, with each individual snail species as a habitat dimension, Thus, Halipegus occidualis
     and Haematoloechus longiplexus infect the planorbid snail, Helisoma anceps, while Halipegus
     eccentricus and Haematoloechus complexus are specific for the physid snail, Physa gyrina.
     Moreover, field studies on the dynamic aspects of this system indicate that these congeners
     exhibit identical seasonal and trophic patterns in utilizing the snail hosts. In contrast,
     among non-congeneric trematode species that share the same snail hosts, segregation occurs
     along temporal and trophic dimensions of the resource spectrum.</p>
    <p>We would therefore argue that the constraïints of resource partitioning at the level of the
     first intermediate host must be examined when considering the evolution of digeneans.</p>

     Valencia, Spain Associated Helminths - Fasetola - Rat - Corsica Ecological studies were
     undertaken on the helminthfauna of the Black rat, Rattus rattus, namely the rat population
     inhabiting the mouth of the Fango river in Northern Corsica, where it acts as a normal
     definitive host of Fasctola hepatica. The purpose of these stu- dies was to determine the
     situation of F. hepatica among the component community of helminths parasitizing this rat
     population and to analyse the information provided by the other helminth species of the same
     component community. In order to distinguish be- tween core species and satellite species and
     taking into account that, as known, the num- ber and distribution of the former, but not the
     latter, may respond to biotic interac- tions, quantitative studies were performed. Results show
     that there are only two core species: Syphacia muris (Yamaguti, 1935) (Nematoda: Oxyuridae)
     with a prevalence of 56% and F. hepatica in 48% of the cases. Intermediate species showing a
     largely lower fre- quence are: Mastophorus murtis (Gmelin, 1790) (Nematoda: Spiruridae) in a
     31,5%, Capilla- rids with 23,7%, Mesocestoides sp. larvae (Cestoda: Mesocestoididae) with12,3%
     and Tri- chosomoides cerassteauda (Bellingham, 1845) (Nematoda: Trichosomoididae) with 12,3%.
     The rest of species are only clear satellite species never surpassing a 3%: Trematoda: Bra-
     chylaima sp. and Corrigia sp.; Cestoda: Hymenolepis spp. and Hydatigera taentaeformis (Batsch,
     1786) larvae; Nematoda: Trichuris muris (Schrank, 1788) and different Heligmo- somids;
     Acanthocephala: Moniliformis montliformis Bremser, 1811 and undetermined larvae.</p>
    <p>When comparing with the helminthfaunas of other Mediterranean insular rat populations
     non-harbouring F. hepatica, the only sporadic presence of adult cestodes, never coexis- ting
     with F#. hepatica, is worth mentioning.</p>

    <p>Trichostrongylidae - Cattle - Epizootiology - Spain.</p>
    <p>In this study, the egg elimination rate in cattle faeces, the number of infected animals, the
     influence of their age on the infection and the seasonality of all these parameters was
     followed. À study of the monthly trichostrongylids eggs elimination was carried out in 10 % of
     the total cattle (Brow-Alpine), at five localities of the Porma river basin, between March 1986
     and March 1987. The farming system for the livestock studied was of extensive type. The cattle
     were divided into the following age groups: less, than 3 years old, from 3 to 7 years and over
     7 years. The faeces were collected early in the morning directly form the rectum of animals
     chosen at random. The eggs were detected by the flotation method with saturated salt solution.
     McMaster chambers were used for the eggs counts.</p>
    <p>Of the 1252 faecal samples examined 27.9 % contained trichostrongylids eggs . The highest
     percentage of the infected animals was observed ïin winter (43.1 %) with the maximum value in
     February (48.2 %). According to the chi-square test (x2 ), statistically significant
     differences were observed among the five localities (X2 = 12.77; P &amp; 0.025) and the months
     of sampling (x2 = 78.33; P &amp; 0.005), with regard to infection prevalence.</p>
    <p>The ‘eggs per gramme (epg) elimination with the faeces ranged between 50 - 2000, average
     132.2 +7.2.The maximum value of the epg mean was observed in May (233.9#67.4), followed by the
     ones from September (184.2 #+20.0) and August (180.9 +25.2). By means of one-way analysis of
     variance statistically significant differences were observed, in relation to the epg, among the
     months of sampling (F = 3.73; P &amp; 0.005).</p>
    <p>The infection prevalence and the number of eliminated epg decreased with the host's age.</p>

    <p>Earthworms, nematode parasites, pasture contamination.</p>
    <p>A field experiment has been carried out to study the influence of earth- worms on the
     transmission of infective Cooperia oncophora larvae from experimental cow pats to grass.
     Results showed that Cow pats, protected from attack by earthworms, disappeared at a much lower
     rate than unpro- tected cow pats. The rapid disintegration of unprotected cow pats resul- ted
     in an approximately 50% reduction of infective C.oncophora larvae on grass in the vicinity of
     these cow pats as compared with larval con- tamination of grass around protected cow pats.</p>
    <p>As earthworms are beneficial soil organisms and as they eat cow pats, it is important, that
     results from another experiment have showed that, apparently, earthworms are not adversely
     affected by eatinq faeces from cattle treated with anthelmintic drugs.</p>

     DK-1870 Frederiksberg C, DENMARK Resistance, age-related, acquired, Ostertagia ostertagi,
     cattle Possible age resistance was compared with acquired resistance in calves exposed to
     pasture contaminated with Ostertagia ostertagi (0.0.). In one grazing season (1988) two groups
     of first-season calves, each comprising six Jersey bullock calves, had been grazed separately
     on an O.0.-free paddock (group P2-) and an O.0.-contaminated paddock (group P2+). The course of
     0.0. infection observed in group P2+ exhibited the well-known pattern typical of moderate to
     high O.0. loads towards the end of the season. In Spring 1989 these two groups were turned out
     in one big herd together with a third group comprising six young first-season calves (group Pl)
     on a large O.0.-contaminated paddock. Worm egg excretion (EPG) serum pepsinogen concentration,
     and body weight were monitored at two- week intervals, and group means were compared.
     Eventually two animals from each group were slaughtered in October, and individual abomasal
     worm burdens were measured. In group P2+ parasitological parameters declined markedly over the
     1988-89 stabling period and remained negligible during the followin grazing period, at the end
     of which worm counts were very low on necropsy. In contrast, EPG of group P2- was roughly
     comparable with that of the young first-season calves grazing the same pasture (Pl).</p>
    <p>However, there seemed to be somewhat lower EPG and worm counts in group P2- than in group PL
     at the end of the season. The results suggest that the impact of age-related resistance per se
     is negligible in comparison with that of resistance acquired through natural first-season
     exposure.</p>

     Koëice,Czechoslovakia Proteocephalus neglectus-copepods-ecological balance In the biotope
     impaired by a great ecological interference-emptying of a water reservoir,studies were carried
     out on the revival of a community of copepods,intermediate hosts of P. neglectus,a parasite of
     Salmo gair- dneri. After filling in the reservoir ,an intensive reproduction of cope- pods was
     observed with a rapid increase in their number and species va- riety. Younger developmental
     stages of copepods (I-IV) little susceptib- le to P. neglectus infection constituted as much as
     83% of the community The copepodocoenosis experienced an inversion of the existing stable re-
     lationships of the dominance and subdominance. The most susceptible in- termediate host of P.
     neglectus - the copepod Cyclops vicinus was enti- rely substituted by the species Eudiaptomus
     zachariasi. The helminth procercoids were found to have an icreased affinity to the males of
     the latter copepod species. Comparing the degree of infection before and after the emptying of
     the water reservoir ,we have found a considerable decrease in the prevalence of procercoid
     (1.67 or 0.09%),in their densi- ty in the environment (165.9 or 0.8 procercoids) as well as in
     the de- gree of infection of the final host. The developmental stages of the cestode P.
     neglectus appear to be &amp; sensitive indicator of the impaired ecological balance of the

    <p>INTERACTIONS BETWEEN HELMINTHS OF VOLES Voitto Haukisalmi, Dept Zool., Univ. Helsinki, P.
     Rautatiekatu 13, SF-00100 Helsinki, Finland Helminths, voles, interactions The interspecific
     relationships between the intestinal helminths of the bank vole Clethrionomys glareolus were
     analyzed in a material collected from two localities in Finland. Certain combinations of
     helminth species co-occurred more often than predicted, especially in the autumn samples of
     mature voles, suggesting that resistance against helminth infections in that vole cohort had
     been impaired. Despite the generally low abundance and diversity of vole helminth communities
     the helminths showed negative interspecific interactions, expressed as shifts in intestinal
     distribution and changes in intensity of infection. The dominant species in the interactions
     were those which co-occurred frequently with other species and showed high micro- habitat
     specificity (Capillaria sp., Nematoda, Catenotaenia sp. and Paranoplocephala aracilis,
     Cestoda). The strongest asymmetric inter- action was observed between Capillaria and
     Heligmosomum mixtum (Nematoda), species which have broadly overlapping intestinal
     distributions. On the other hand, two related species of nematode, Heligmosomum mixtum and
     Heligmosomoides glareoli, showing considerable intestinal overlap did not interact negatively.
     The lack of negative interactions may be due to their differences in radial distribution in the
     intestine.</p>

     bothi - Attachment - Gill microhabitat This study describes, with scanning electron microscopy,
     attachment of the haptor of Bothitrema bothi (Bothitrematidae) as well as microhabitat on the
     gills of the flounder, Scophthalmus aquosus, (Bothidae) for this species. B. bothi were
     collected from the gills and nostrils of 285.</p>
    <p>aquosus taken in the New York Bight, northwest Atlantic Ocean during March and April, 1989.
     Fish heads were quickly fixed in formalin and examined later in the laboratory. For scanning
     electron microscopy, worm and gill material was processed using standard techniques, critical
     point dried, and viewed with a JOEL T-20. Haptor ‘'footprints'"' suggest that attachment to
     host gills is largely by suction when the distal cusps of the 50+ radially arranged trough-like
     supporting rods press into the host tissue sealing the edge of the haptor. Adult worms can move
     on the gills but are confined to the arches and rakers by their relatively large size.</p>
    <p>Analysis of variance of the 306 B. bothi on gills showed significant arch (p&lt;0.001), side
     (p&lt;0.025), and position (p&lt;0.001) differences. The number of worms on the right (lower)
     four arches was significantly larger (p&lt;0.025) than the number on the left (upper) arches of
     these flounders.</p>
    <p>The middle third of arches had significantly more worms (p&lt;0.05) than either the anterior
     or posterior thirds. This is the first report of an asymmetric distribution of a monogenean on
     the left and right sets of gill arches in a fish.</p>

    <p>Trichostrongylidae - Sheep - Epizootiology - Spain With this study, the elimination pattern
     of Trichostrongylidae eggs by sheep of Leôn mountains was trying to be stablished. Between
     March 1986 and March 1987 the eggs elimination of the mentioned-above nematodes was monthly
     followed in 10 % of the flock animals (crossbyred Merino and "Churra"), which grazed in four
     different areas of the Porma river basin. The farming system for the livestock studied was of
     the extensive type. The faeces were collected early in the morning directly from the rectum of
     animals chosen at random and were processed by the flotation method with saturated salt
     solution. McMaster chambers were used for the egg counts. The sheep were grouped according to
     their ages in: less than 1 year old, from 1 to 4 years and over 4 years.</p>
    <p>Eggs of trichostrongylids were found in 56.6 % of the 937 faeces samples examined.</p>
    <p>The highest infection prevalence was observed in winter (80.5 %) with the maximum value in
     January (100%). Likewise, the prevalence decreased with the host's age, obtaining the highest
     figure in the youngest animals. On applying chi-square test (X2 ) Statistl cally significant
     differences were detected, as regards the infection prevalence, among the 4 areas (X2= 90.67; P
     £ 0.005) and the months of sampling (x2 = 70.23; P &amp; 0.005).</p>
    <p>The average eggs per gramme (epg) was 405.8+#+17.3, being 50 and 2850 the maximum and
     minimum, respectively. The highest average number of epq was observed in February (670.6 +94.9)
     and the minimum in August (202.6 +30.9). The greatest epg average was recorded in the second
     animal age group (420.6 #+27.7) and the lowest in the first one (367.4 +30.0). By means of
     one-way analysis of variance, statistically significant differences were observed, in relation
     to the epg, among the areas (F = 10.37; P £ 0.005) and the months of sampling (F = 6.20; P $

     Kodzo Hodasi Clinostomum cysts on Chrysichthys À total of 1,320 metacercarial cysts of
     Clinostomum complanatum (Rud.1819) were recovered from 63 infected Chrysichthys nigrodigitatus
     (Lacépède) bought from the lower reaches of the Volta River near Ada, giving an incidence of
     20.9 cysts per infected fish. The meta- cercariae encysted in muscle tissues under the skin,
     the gill region, the eye sockets and occasionally in the walls of the viscera. This is the
     first report of the cyst from the viscera. For the first time, precise locations of the
     parasites on the fish have been pre- sented on consolidated maps of the dorsal and the ventral
     surfaces of the fish. On the whole cysts were found to be equally distributed on the dorsal and
     the ventral surfaces.</p>
    <p>The head region including the gill chambers harboured 531 parasites (40.27 of total) whilst
     789 (59.87) were found on the rest of the body including the viscera. The cysts appear to show
     preference for sub-cutaneous, muscular tissue with the highest concentra- tions in the gill
     region, the eye sockets and the anterior dorsal fin area. There was no correlation between the
     size of fish and number of metaceracarial cysts. An attempt has been made to estimate the
     percentage of infected fish (c.327) in the population. Absence of infection in fish from
     Akosombo and Kpong areas north of the survey area might be due to the absence of the fresh
     water snails which act as first intermediate hosts.</p>

    <p>Adult and juvenile Lymnaea truncatula (4 and 1 mm high) have been exposed to miracidia of
     Fasciola hepatica (2 parasites per snail), then to first-stage larvae (LI) of Muellerius
     capillaris (on a basis of 100 LI for 75 snails) with a break of 4 hours, 7, 14, and 30 days
     between both exposures. The controls are constituted by monospecific infections of molluscs of
     the same size. The histological study of L. truncatula killed up to day 35 after the second
     exposure has showed that the development of both parasites in the same snail was rare (6 cases
     out of 240). The dual infection of 4 mm high snaiïls resulted in a 50 Z and more decrease in
     the redial burden, in the disappearance of depending forms, and in a decrease in the number of
     independent rediae for periods of 7 days and more between exposures; in young snails, and for
     the same break period between exposures, the decrease in the redial burden was only 10 %
     compared to the number resulting from the monospecific infection of 1 mm individuals. A late
     maturity has been observed for living independent rediae in groups with break periods of 14 and
     30 days, for adults as well as for young ones. Larvae of M. capillaris are not to be found in
     young snaïils. Their number dropped from 74 to 94 7% in adults with a dual infection, but
     third-stage larvae (L3) have been found in snails with an abortive fasciolid infection, for the
     break periods of 14 and 30 days, whereas the development of M. capillaris stopped after the
     second stage in monospe- cific infections. The authors see the formation of L3 as a phenomenon
     of facilitation.</p>

     Malmberg on the Atlantic Salmon (Salmo salar) was studied on basis of: (1) Detailed records of
     the number and temporal sequence of all births and the age at death of indi- vidual flukes on
     isolated salmon; (2) records ot the increases in the parasite populations living on isolated
     salmon and in multi-host systems; and (3) similar records for multi-host systems approximating
     to hatchery conditions. The mean lifespan of the parasite was negatively correlated with water
     temperature: 33.7 days at 2.59 C and 4.5 days at 19.09°C. The net reproductive rate (R°) peaked
     between 6.5°C and 13.0°C, and was approximately 2.4 offspring/parasite at these two
     temperatures. The period between the successive births of the offspring (maximum four) and the
     estimated generation time were negatively correlated with temperature.</p>
    <p>The innate capacity for increase (rh) was positively correlated: from 0.02/parasite/day at
     2.5°C to 0.22/parasite/day at 19.09°C. The growth of G. salaris populations was positively
     correlated and was higher on isolated fish than in multi-host systems, though less than the
     potential parasite population growth estimated from r,,. The mean intensity of parasites
     continued to grow throughout all the experiments, indicating poor ability among hosts to mount
     a resistance against infection. The results support the reports of high susceptibility of the
     Eastern Atlantic Ocean Salmon to parasitism by G. salaris.</p>

     to mid winter, 75% in early summer, 40% in mid summer, 66% at the end of summer and 70% at next
     winter. A similar pattern was observed in the slugs. Deroceras _reticulatum was the dominant
     species in winter and spring (Cwet period) and Lehmannia nyctelia was more abundant in summer

     found under tree limbs and debris scattered widely over the paddocks. During the dry periods in
     summer the slug population decreased, mostly Lehmannia was found under the debris and the
     majority of slugs were found in areas around springs, ground seepage, ponds and running water
     in moist vegetation. Those areas were also harbouring aquatic or amphibious gastropod snails,

     third-stage (L.,) on irrigated kikuyu pasture was measured. During 1988, three replicates of
     four strata samples were collected at five diurnal intervals on 18 collection days. Upper and
     lower herbage, mat and soil strata samples were processed and larvae recovered. The log mean
     larval counts were analysed by a step-wise regression model. For upper herbage, the predictor
     of the log counts was soil moisture with an r-square value of 0.31; predictors for lower
     herbage were air temperature, soil temperatures (mat and 2 cm depth), temperature under the
     sheep faeces and windspeed with an r-square value of 0.40, Predictors for the mat stratum
     included relative humidity and soil moisture (r-square value 0.35). Log counts of L, in the
     soil were predicted by relative humidity, radiation and illumination with an r-square value of
     0.18. With further development, such a model could eventually be integrated into measures for

     study was to establish whether Atrazine could be responsible for liver fluke decreasing
     observed in many areas of North Italy under intensive farming conditions.</p>
    <p>Preliminary studies showed a remarkable decrease in the hatching rate of Fasciola hepatica
     eggs from condamned bovine livers, when incubated with Atrazine (50-100ppm). In this study
     F.hepatica eggs were recovered from experimentally infected rabbit and incubated with lower
     levels of Atrazine (1-10ppm). The embryonic development and hatching rate were correlated to
     the extent of the herbicide present in the eggs, determined by GC/MS analysis after extensive
     washing with distilled water and organic solvent extraction. A negative correlation was found
     betweeen the two parameters and the residual amounts of Atrazine found in eggs.These results
     confirm previous observations on Atrazine toxicity and further evidence that chemical weeding
     can play a key role in liver fluke decrease.</p>

     intervals for 360 days (up to 230 times).</p>
    <p>The intensiveness of the invasion was estimated. We determined 3 types of L. intestinalis
     excretion according to the mean number of excreted cysts and according to the frequency and
     duration of intervals between excretion of parasite. 4 children had the I-st type of excretion,
     6-II type and 7-III type. In the conditions excluding the possibility of re- invasion in
     children with the III-d type of L. intestinalis excretion (1ow level of intensiveness of the
     invasion) spontaneous curing occured between the 30 and 53 days of experiment, in children with
     the II-a ty- pe of parasite excretion insignificant decrease in the intensiveness of invasion
     was observed. In children with the I-st type of excretion (high level of intensiveness of
     invasion) the character of the invasion remained unchanged during the whole observation

    <p>Data of this kind have been collected in Muheza, Tanzania, in both 1962 and 1987. The data

    <p>Trivial explanations for this contrast have been considered and rejected, and it seems that
     human infectiousness has greatly increased over the last 25 years. The most likely reason seems
     to be a considerable increase in chloroquine consumption.</p>
    <p>The data also imply that the extrinsic period lasts only just over three gonotrophic cycles,
     or 9-11 days, that no more than a small fraction of mosquitoes are refractory to infection, and

    <p>A biological and ecological study aimed at the desing of strategic control measures for
     Boophilus microplus (CANESTRINI, 1887) was conducted in Pedro Leopoldo County, Minas Gerais
     State, Brazil. At each 14 days, from November, 1983 to October, 1986, engorged fe males were
     distributed freely or in tubes in a pasture of Brachiarta decumbens. Larvae were detected in
     the pasture throughout the years. The survival period of non-parasitic phases at pasture was
     maximum when engorged females dropped in the dry months (April - June), and minimum when they
     dropped in the rainy months (October-December). Calves free of ticks were introduced in a
     naturally infested pasture during the period of November, 1983 to October, 1986. At each 14
     days thereafter, the population of engorged females was counted. B. mécioplus was found in the
     calves throughout the year. The number of ticks per animal varied from 10 in February to 451 in
     March (mean of 138). Four generations of ticks per year were observed in the calves. Tick
     population varied in size within and between years, due to climatic conditions. Based on the
     obtained in the study of the pa rasitic and non-parasitic stages, a 6-dips control strategic
     was tested from November, 1986 to November, 1987. The strategic dips reduced the level of
     infestations. November is the most recommended month for the begining of the strategic dips
     becauce it is the time for the first generation of tiks to appear.</p>

    <p>INHIBITION + OSTERTAGIA - CATTLE Objectives of the epidemiological studies were to establish
     whether or not inhibited development of the nematode Ostertagia ostertagi in Wyoming native
     cattle occured and when. Necropsies of 208 native Wyoming cattle aged 7 months to 8 years
     revealed Ostertagia spp infection in abomasa in 100% /98% Ostertagia ostertagi and 41.8%
     Ostertagia bisonis/. Seasonal examination from January to December 1988 of abomasal contents
     and digest mucosa revealed that in the climatic conditions of the State of Wyoming larval
     inhibition of the nematodes Ostertagia ostertagi and O.bisonis occurs from the September to
     April with the peak of inhibition in January (CBB%) and maturation of larvae from February with
     peak of intensity of infection in April. The present results indicated, that inhibition of
     larvae of Ostertagia ostertagi in Wyoming native cattle is late Autum-Winter inhibition.
     Results of studies permit the supposition, that Ostertagia bisonis normally a parasite of wild
     ruminants, played an important role in the epidemiology of ostertagiosis in Wyoming cattle. The
     present studies give a basis for recomendation of control of nematodes in Wyoming cattle.</p>

    <p>Fasciola hepatica, Climate forecast, cattle.</p>
    <p>A climate forecast system developed from a 5-year F. hepatica transmission data base from
     central Louisiana cattle (1979-84) was validated using herd prevalence and sentinel calf data
     for 1985-89. An annual index was calculated by summing the number of growing degree days (GDD;
     Base 10°C) for days in which moisture is present in the top 2.5cm of a 15cm Thornthwaite water
     budget soil moisture model.</p>
    <p>When moisture exceeded field capacity, GDD was multiplied by a surplus water factor to
     reflect habitat flood dispersal of infective stages. For 10 Louisiana climate stations located
     in fluke areas, annual index values were compared to 'normal' values calculated using 30-year
     average climate data. Low, moderate, high or very high risk forecasts were issued each spring
     and fall to cattlemen on the relative need for flukecide treatment. Fall index values (Range
     956-5741) were consistent with herd infection data and calf fluke burdens (2-325/calf year) in
     the central Louisiana study herd. Egg-cercariae laboratory development requires 600 GDD at
     25°C. Annual index values (2 or more years) and 30-year normals were calculated for 3 sites in
     Florida and 10 sites in Texas. Annual index values varied widely at each site and 30-year
     normals varied from 418-3098, suggesting the value of the forecast in defining both annual risk
     and a site-specific severity and seasonal transmission profile. Temporal patterns indicate that
     late winter through spring transmission occurs in South Louisiana, East Texas and North
     Florida, with less winter development at northern sites and the possibility of 2 transmission
     seasons (winter and summer) in South Florida.</p>

    <p>Trichuris muris, nutrition, immunity, population dynamics It is increasingly recognised that
     nutritional deficiency may enhance susceptibility to infectious disease via impairment in host
     immune response. The effect of this interact- ion on intestinal helminth population dynamics is
     less well known. The present study examines the influence of protein nutrition on the
     immunology and transmission dynamics of experimental Trichuris muris infections in CBA/Ca mice.
     Host protein nutrition induced differential T. muris infection dynamics. With both single and
     trickle infection, worms were expelled from well nourished mice before patency but persisted
     and became fecund in malnourished hosts. Serological analyses indicated that susceptible,
     malnour- ished mice had higher parasite-specific Ab titres to T. muris ES antigen in sera, as
     quantified by ELISA, and also recognised a broader range of ES antigen components as assessed
     by Western blot analysis. The immunological analyses suggest that protein malnutrition may
     enhance murine antibody responses to T. muris infections. These para- doxical results point to
     the complexity of the nutrition-immunity-infection relationship; and are discussed in relation
     to the role of the nutrition-immunity interaction in the transmission and control of endemic
     helminthiasis.</p>

    <p>The purpose of this study was to stablish the epidemiological pattern of ovine verminous
     bronchopneumonia in the mountain region of Leëén. So, parasitological research on definitive
     (ovine) and intermediate (mollusc) hosts have been carried out for two years. Nevertheless,
     only the data referring to monthly larvae I elimination by the sheep in the first year of
     sampling are summarized in this paper. A total of 599 faecal samples from 67 tagged ovine (60%
     of the flock) were analized. At the beginning of the study, the animals were aged between 4
     months and 8 years. They grazed in an area of 562 hectares situated in the upper Porma basin.
     The samples were directly taken from the rectum of the sheep, early in the morning, and
     processed by the Baerman-Wetzel method. McMaster chambers were used for larval counts.</p>
    <p>All the animals eliminated Protostrongylidae larvae, but the percentage of samples containing
     these nematodes was 78.8%. The number (n°) of larvae per gramme (lpg) ranged between 0.1 and
     500.0, average 33.3+71.1 (+tstandard error). The highest value of the 1pg average was detected
     in the 5 year old animals (78.3+114.6) and the lowest in the lambs (9.9423.0). This figure was
     greater in July (64.7+105.8). The species of Protostrongylidae found in the faeces were:
     Muellerius capillaris (62.4% infected samples, 34.2+73.5 lpg), Protostrongylus spp. (62.2%,
     5.4+9.3), Cystocaulus ocreatus (32.9%, 5.3+12.4) and Neostrongylus linearis (12.3%,
     3.346.1).</p>
    <p>On the total animals, 94% eliminated Dictyocaulus filaria (Dictyocaulidae) larvae, although
     only 39.7% of the samples contained larvae. The n° of Ilpg ranged between 0.1 and 36.7, average
     2.1+4.4. The maximum value of the Ilpg mean was observed üïin the 2 year old animals (3.6+6.0)
     and the minimum in those aged 7-8 years (1.3+3.0).</p>

     vs.</p>
    <p>53200. Differences between the two species could, at least partly, be due to different
     feeding and living habits. Root voles feed mainly on monocot stem bases and rhizomes close to
     and in the ground whereas bank voles feed forbs, seeds, dwarf shrubs and lichens higher from
     the ground.</p>
    <p>Root voles also have dense underground tunnel systems. Furthermore, due to the differences in
     the social behavior root voles reach much higher population densities than bank voles. AI]
     these factors could promote the abundace of Eimeria in root voles. Coccidiosis is usually a
     problem for young animals and our results are in accordance with this. In root voles
     coccidiosis may contribute to the mortality and therefore affect population dynamics.</p>

     naturally infecbted, intensity of infection 78 and 250 larvae/g muscles) was studied. In the
     first series of experiments carcasses were on the surface of the ground in the forest; in the
     second series - in a burrow (50 sm of depth). The experiment continued during 5 months (October
     of 1988 - March of 1989), the temperature of the air changed from +I0 to -289C, humidity - from
     66% to 78%. In the first series of our experi- ments 0.02% of larvae survived, in the second -
     58-60%. Infectiousness of survived larvae in the Ist series was not higher than 0.I% from rats,
     I0% - from fox and 20% - from brown bear; in the second series — 10%, 40% and 60% respectively.
     The main role of free-living infectious larvae T.spiralis from rotting carcasses in
     epizootology of so called zoologic trichinellosis (weak and very weak infection of rodents and
     insectivora; large carnivora that eat them accumulate infection) and circulation of T.Spiralis

     Warszawa, Poland Caryophyllaeus laticeps - site selection The distribution of C. laticeps in
     the four sections of the alimentary tract of bream (oesophagus and three sections of the
     intestine) was examined, taking into account the age (four classes) and infrapopulation density
     (four groups) of parasites in the individual hosts.</p>
    <p>The hypothesis of independence of these two variables was tested using the chi-square test.
     Caryophyllaeus laticeps can occupy all three sections of the intestine, but not oesophagus of
     bream. In the individual hosts its location showed a great diversity, but, at the population
     level, the greatest number of specimens was in the posterior intestine, and the least - in the
     anterior intestine. Such a distribution is independent of the infrapopulation density.</p>
    <p>The distribution of the four age classes, however, depends on the infrapopulation density. It
     was uniform only, when the number of parasites was not greater then 5. At a greater density the
     majority of young specimens occurred in the anterior intestine, while the gravid once prevailed
     in the posterior intestine. Such an "age segregation" seems not to result from the secondary
     migration of the tapeworms. The authors think that the parasite once attached, remains at the
     same location until death. But there can be several recruitments of parasites to fish, and the
     specimens which colonize the host later, remain mainly in the anterior part of the
     intestine.</p>

    <p>We have intented to obtain data about the persistence of O.ostertagi L, in the pastures of a
     spanish region with continental climate (Salamanca province),where cattle is bred in an
     extensive production system.</p>
    <p>It were used faeces of artificially infected calfs with a autochthonous strain maintai- ned
     in laboratory. Infected faeces pats were deposited in plots in a field ungrazed for years
     throughout 1986-87 and the presence of L. on the herbage of around every two weeks until its
     disappearence was observed. Constant themometrical records were taken at the level of the
     ground and at 5 cm. above and below of it. Rain was measured in the same plots.</p>
    <p>The mean monthiy thermopluviometric records in the habitat were:Winter 69c-45 mm.;spring
     150c-27 mm.;summer 249c-20 mm. and autumn 139c-48 mm.,respectively. In this conditions, L. in
     faeces deposited in late spring and early summer persisted 10 months,until next spring. L, from
     summer survived 7 months,also until the same spring. L, of faeces deposi ted in lake autumn and
     winter survived 5 months and those from early spring 2,5 months.</p>
    <p>All generations of larvae have tendency to disappear from pastures in the second half of
     spring. The greater concentrations of L. on the herbage were produced during the period
     November-March and the minor in June-August.</p>
    <p>Conclusions: 1) The prevailing transmission pattern is autumn-winter. 2) During main part of
     summer, pastures can be considered as "safe pastures". 3) Climatic conditions in spring and
     spe- cially in summer are in this region more limitative than in other countries of Europe.</p>

    <p>The objective was to know dynamics of reinfection in school population of a suburban co-
     mmunity near Mexico City and with this results, propose the quimioprophylaxis best sche- me.
     Coproparasitoscopic tests were performed to 1263 children of primary school (total school
     population). Children with positive tests received albendazol and/or tinidazol at recommended
     dosages, for helminthic or protozoal infections respectively. Three days af- ter treatment
     coproparasitoscopic studies (one sample a day) were performed, and in case of positive results
     they received treatment again, until the total population were free of parasites. At month 4
     the tests were performed again. The results were: Parasite N° Cases Parasited Reinfection Cases

     hepatica. Human fascioliasis. Watercress ponds.</p>
    <p>Thirty-seven natural watercress ponds having caused cases of human fascioliasis in Limou- sin
     (France) have been searched during 18 years to study the number of lymnaeid snails and to
     determine their infection by Fasciola hepatica. The number of Lymnaea truncatula remained low
     (less than 80 per station) when the snail was the only lymnaeid species; the number was even
     lower (from 3 to 20 snails) when the snail lived with L. glabra or with L. peregra ovata. L.
     truncatula had two générations per year in monospecific populations; it often had only one
     generation (with layings in July-August) in populations with two lymnaeid species. The
     infection of L. truncatula by F. hepatica was irregular, with a pe- riod of 3 to 14 years
     between two successive infections (8 years average); the fasciolid infection of both other
     species has not been observed. The enclosure of watercress ponds (by barbed wires, by
     wire-netting, or by picket-fence) and the absence of cows (or of sheep) were not enough to
     prevent the fasciolid infection. The number of molluscs infec- ted by F. hepatica was low (1.3
     to 5.4 %) in stations with only L. truncatula; it was higher (15 to 66 %) in ponds populated
     with the two lymnaeid species. The presence of metacercariae is closely linked to the mollusc
     infection and their number is limited (3 to 31 parasites per ky of strained watercress). Two
     other parasitosis have been observed in L. truncatula (Echinostomum sp.: 3 cases, unidentified
     species: l case) with a lower infection rate than that of F. hepatica. The authors explain
     these results by the geolo- gical nature of stations (on granite or on diorite) and by their
     altitude (313 to 514 m).</p>

     (T.spiralis s.str., Tl; T.nativa, T2; Tri- chinella sp.3, T3; T.pseudospiralis, T4; Trichinella
     T5, T6 and T8; T.nelsoni, T7) ha- ve been studied to evaluate the importance of biological
     differences among them. T1 and T4 proved to be the more differentiated gene pools. Tl showed
     the highest new- born larvae production in vitro per female, and that it was the only
     Trichinella well adapted to rats. The two peculiar characteristics of T4 are its well known
     infectivi- ty to birds and the absence of modified nurse cells. T2 muscle larvae showed the hi-
     ghest resistance to freezing. The other gene pools proved distinct from each other but more
     closely related among themselves. These results are in agreement with bioche- mical data.
     Moreover, taking into account two physical variables, ïi.e. isotherms in January and July in
     the locality of parasite origin, we found out that each gene pool (except for Tl and T4) seems

     Lepocreadium pegorchis, Aphanurus stossichi, Bacciger israelensis, Plagioporus idoneus and
     Diphterostomum israelense parasitic in the digestive tract of marine teleostei collected from
     the coast of Jounieh (East Mediterranean), was analysed as a function of the host-size. In two
     trematode species, infections were observed from the lowest size classes of the sample, with a
     clear tendency to an increase of abundance in old fishes. In two other species, parasites only
     appear above a rather high threshold class, young individuals always being uninfected.
     Regarding the fifth species, host invasion occurs early, but parasites disappear above a well
     defined size class, old fishes being uninfected.</p>
    <p>A given trematode species, when parasitising several host species, shows similar
     abundance/host size relations- hips ; for instance it is the case for Plagioporus idoneus in
     Oblada melanura, Diplodus sargus and Diplodus vulgaris. .With various species of trematodes
     infecting a single host species, curves can be markedly distinct; this is illustrated by
     Lepocreadium pegorchis which was collected from Pagellus erythrinus below 15 cm, whereas
     Diphterostomum israelense parasitized the same fish above approximately the same size. There is
     no evidence that such a replacement of a trematode by another in the course of host growth, is
     a result of an interspecific competition.</p>

     host-parasite species specificity,using L.major,L.donovani and L.amazonensis failed to produce
     infection in all 3 cases. 100 first-passage,late-logarathmic phase promastigotes grown from
     amastigotes isolated from hamster foot lesions for L.major and L.amazonensis and hamster spleen
     for L.donovani were used to guarantee infectivity and were injected ID/SC into the ear pinna in
     two animals and IP in one animal for each parasite species. Smears and cultures were used to
     monitor infection.Failure to infect with L.major was surprising,as the breeding pairs of
     P.obesus and the L.major strain all came from the Jordan Valley (JV).The strain was isolated
     from a human lesion 14 years before and maintained in hamsters.A strain recently isolated from
     a wild- caught P.obesus from the JV,immediately passaged into and reisolated from hamaters and
     given as first-passage promastigotes at 106 and 107 organisms and as amasti- gotes from
     heavily-infected,mascerated hamster lesion tissue also failed to infect laboratory-bred
     P.obesus;as did promastigotes of a strain recently isolated from a wild-caught Phlebotomus
     papatasi from the JV,fed.artificially through membranes to and redissected from
     laboratory-reared P.papatasi.However,using young,3 to 7- week old P.obesus,infections were
     obtained with promastigotes of the 14-year old L.major strain and with those of the
     L.amazonensis strain.These results suggest an age immunity phenomenon and questions
     host-parasite specificity.</p>

     Queensland, St Lucia 4067 . . Australia Crab, Nematomorph, parasite ecology, symbiosis Do
     symbiotic crabs gain protection from parasitism by their association with living corals? In à
     recent expedition to Heron Island, I examined over 550 crabs representing 7 families, and 20
     species. Crabs were collected from 3 distinct reef habitats; inter- tidal beachrock, reef flat,
     and subtidal reef crest locations. From a preliminary survey, I found that crabs in symbiotic
     association with corals appeared to have fewer parasite species than non-symbiotic crabs. It is
     known that crabs symbiotic with corals defend their coral hosts from sea star predators, and in
     return gain food, and protection from crab predators. I hypothesize that symbiotic crabs gain
     protection from parasitism by their association with their coral hosts. Since corals have
     cnidocytes that sting and kil1 small soft bodied animals, infective stages of parasites may be
     killed before infecting crabs. Indeed, the only parasites found in obligate coral-inhabiting
     crabs were nematomorphs, whose larvae develop à resistant mucous cyst. In a series of
     laboratory experiments using combinations of crabs, living and dead corals, and crab parasites
     (microphallid cercariae shed from common intertidal snails) I hope to further elucidate the
     relationship between obligate coral crabs and their coral hosts.</p>

    <p>Alaria marcianae, mesocercaria, primates, transmammary transmission Human infections with
     mesocercariae are known, but it was only recently documented that this stage will undergo
     transmammary transmission in rodent and carnivore hosts. The question is, can they do the same
     in humans? To shed light on what occurs in primates, a lactating Callithrix jacchus was
     experimentally infected with 600 mesocercariae of Alaria marcianae 10 days after parturition to
     determine if she would transmit the mesocercariae to her offspring. Her twin infants were
     necropsied 4 weeks later and found infected with a total of 16 mesocercariae in their tissues.
     The female was mated again and gave birth to a second litter of triplets. She was not given
     additional mesocercariae. One infant died within hours of birth without suckling and was
     negative for any stage of A. marcianae. The other two were allowed to nurse for 5 weeks,
     necropsied and found infected with a total of 115 mesocercariae in various tissues, 1
     metacercaria in the lungs, and 1 immature and 2 fully-formed, ovigerous adults in the small
     intestines. The female was necropsied at the same time (6 months post-inocu- lation) and 246
     mesocercariae were recovered. No other stage was found. Histological examination of her mammary
     glands revealed numerous mesocercariae in the milk-laden alveoli. In light of the fact that
     there is no known chemotherapy for systemic Alaria infections, it is concluded that human
     females presenting with mesocercarial infections should be counseled on the long-term
     possibilities of infection and possibly dissuaded from nursing future infants.</p>

     humans. A total of 56C children, 0.2 to 17 year old, hospitalized in Childrents Memorial
     Hospital in Warsaw with symptoms of gastroenterocolitis were screened for Cryptosporidium
     oocysts and Blastocystis hominis.</p>
    <p>Studies were carried out during 27 months period between April 1986 and June 1988,
     Cryptosporidium oocysts were found in 14 /2.5%/ of 560 children and vacuolated forms of
     Blastocystis hominis were present in 5x of 257 children examined. There was no association of
     prevalence of Cryptosporidium infection with age and sex of children or children from different
     areas. However, relatively higher rate of Cryptospori- dium oocysts was observed among children
     of group 0.2 to 3 Years of age /50%/ and among children from villages /43%/. This study
     confirms a rather sporadic occurrence of Cryptosvoridium infection in young children which can
     be considered as important cause of diarrhea and weipht loss.</p>

     intermediate host - pulmonates - field study Infection levels and the distribution of infection
     of the protostrongylid nematode Elaphostrongylus rangiferi, were studied throughout the summer
     season in 1988 and 1989 within a reindeer area of Finnmark county, North Norway. Pulmonates
     were vcollected within ten sites which differed in topography and vegetation, brought to the
     laboratory and examined for infection in a trichinoscope. The prevalence of infection differed
     significantly among the sites, and this pattern was fairly consistent in both years.</p>
    <p>Arion subfuscus, Deroceras spp. and Succinea sp. were more infected than other gastropod
     species occurring within the area. All larval stages were found throughout the season. A high
     number of L3 was found early spring, indicating that thirdstage larvae can survive in
     gastropods from one year to the next. Development of larvae in snails and slugs was slower in
     1989 than in 1988, probably due to a warner summer in 1988. The problem of how reindeer aquire
     infection is discussed. It is hypothesized that Arion subfuscus and Succinea sp. may be key
     species in the transmission of E. rangiferi within the area studied. ‘ S6.A 71 P.</p>

     Biological control of house mice Populations of the house mouse, Mus domesticus, erupt at
     irregular intervals to produce mouse plagues in the cereal-growing regions of southeastern
     Australia. A program aimed at understanding the ecological mechanisms responsible for formation
     of plagues and seeking strategies to reduce mouse numbers is in progress, to reduce their
     economic, social and environmental impact. The nematode, Capillaria hepatica, reduces
     significantly the productivity of BALB/c female mice in the laboratory.</p>
    <p>The effect of the nematode on wild mice was tested in large enclosures in the cereal-growing
     region. Mouse populations inside and outside the enclosures were regulated by factors other
     than C. hepatica. Serum antibodies to nine viruses were detected in these wild mice. One of
     these, murine cytomegalovirus (MCMV), significantly affects a variety of immunologic responses
     to other antigenic stimuli. This potent immuno-suppressant effect may potentiate C.hepatica
     infection. Consequently, concomitant infection of mice with C.hepatica and MCMV was
     investigated to determine if it (i) accentuated MCMV-induced disease, (ii) accentuated the
     pathogenic effect of C.hepatica, (iii) reduced the pathogenic effect of C.hepatica.</p>

    <p>In order to test these possibilities PC infected, immunosuppressed rats were transferred from
     Costa Rica to Helsinki and placed in the same room but in separate cages as local Wistar rats.
     The local rats contracted the infection and after 62-86 days died in Pneumocystis pneumonia
     having a cyst concentration of 2.2 - 480 10° cyst/g lung tissue. Local rats without aircontact
     to infected rats failed to develop disease. Local infected rats were subsequently shown to
     trans- mit the infection further. The results also suggest that the infection is transmitted by
     air, and that rats originally free of "latent infec- tion" are susceptible to the organism.</p>

     Shpol of Biolgaica EL Queen Mary and Westfield College,London University, Population dynamics -
     Pseudodiplorchis - Monogenea - Transmission The life cycle of the monogenean Pseudodiplorchis
     americanus is uniquely adapted to exploit an opportunity for invasion totalling less than 24
     hours each year. Infective larvae are discharged by adult parasites as their hosts - desert
     toads, Scaphiopus couchii - enter temporary water to spawn. Host noctural activity restricts
     each exposure to a maximum of 7 hours, and this narrow window enables very detailed analysis of
     transmission dynamics. Field studies in Arizona recorded concentrations of infective larvae in
     newly-formed ponds during host spawning (by plankton sampling), and recruitment of larvae into
     toad populations (by dissection). Continuous immigration of toads during the night leads to a
     simultaneous increase both in the concentration of infective stages and in host population
     density. The force of infection increases exponentially : more than 30% of invasions during one
     night occur in the final hour before dawn (04.00h) after which the toads leave water, abruptly
     halting transmission. Analysis of host behaviour reveals a strong correlation of individual
     larval burdens with host sex, timing of arrival/departure, mating activity.</p>
    <p>If there are repeated rains, generally a maximum of 3, males may return and acquire up to 3
     increments of invasion, culminating in a prevalence of 100% and a mean of over 100
     iarvae/host.</p>
    <p>Females enter only one assembly and acquire a mean of about 40 larvae/host. Despite very
     efficient transmission (individual oncomiracidia have a 30% chance of invasion), studies in
     both field and laboratory show a dramatic regulation of parasite burdens. One year
     post-infection, when parasites have completed reproductive preparation, over 50% of toads have
     lost their infections entirely and the remainder carry a mean of only 5 adult worms/host.
     Maximum burdens fall from 300 to 30 worms. Field data for a single population of S.couchii over
     a 7 year period show that each massive invasion is consistently followed by a reduction in
     relative density a year later to only 3-4% of initial levels.</p>

     Infections in the remaining groups were either unabbreviated or abbreviated With levamisole

    <p>Recovery rates were extremely variable between individuals within all groups. Numbers of male
     and/or female worms were not significantly different between treatment groups. There was a
     tendency for female:male ratios to be lower when anthelmintic was not given, 0.42 and 0.44
     versus 1.38, 0.90 and 1.06. Without abbreviation of infections mean recovery rates were 7.0%

     infections were abbreviated between both challenges or before the first or second challenge
     (20.0%, 17.1% and 15.2%, respectively; P &lt;0.03).</p>
    <p>These data suggest that, under experimental conditions, kids acquire a resistance to pulsed

     India Ascariasis, epidemiology, environmental factors Ascariasis is a commonly encountered
     health problem in many regions of India, where the socio-economic environment is dominated by
     poverty, poor living status and insufficient sanitation. The present study reports the level of
     contamination of the environment with Ascaris eggs in Shillong, Meghalaya (which represents a
     high rainfall area of India) and also evaluates the possible role of environmental factors viz.
     temperature, humidity, pH of soil etc. upon their devel&gt;pment to infectivity in vitro and
     survivat in the region.</p>
    <p>Screening of soils from house yards, children's park etc., and salad vegetables showed
     Ascaris eggs to be the common contaminants. The pattern of egg development was studied in
     relation to the temperature and humidity conditions prevailing in the region. Eggs incubated at
     20°C and 83% relative humidity (r.h.) developed to infective stage between 48-52 days; at 13°C
     and 64% r.h. the eggs did not undergo development; at 28°C and r.h. between 80 and 100%, eggs
     could reach to infective stage in 26-30 days. Comparatively rapid development was noticed in an
     acidic soil (pH 5.0).</p>
    <p>The moderarely high temperature and high humidity recorded for most part of the year in this
     region would allow a prolonged survival of infective eggs in the environment, which in turn
     would enhance the chances of infection among the community people throughout the year.</p>

     and 20 miracidia of Echinostoma liei under laboratory conditions. Cercarial production was
     determined biweekly for four hours stimulant period. In these snail groups,the numbers of
     survivor shedding snails showed peaks (19,19,19,11) after 7,7,10 and 3 days respectively.
     However, there is no statistically significant difference between mean total numbers of
     cercariae per shedding snail during the entire life span in these groups. The cercarial output
     reaches a peak at 31 days post first emission in groups exposed to 1,5 and 20 miracidia/snail
     while in the group exposed to 10 miracidia/snail,this peak occurred later at 70 days.</p>
    <p>The mean life span of infected snails in the group exposed to 1 miracidium/snail is
     significantly shorter than in the group exposed to 10 miracidia/snail being 4 and 62 days

     snails is similar (51 days). The low level of cercarial production (1-100 cercariae/snail) is
     mostly presented in snail group exposed to 10 miracidia/snail while the high level (21000
     cercariae/snail) is equally presented in groups exposed to 5 and 10 miracidia/snail. The level
     of total periodic cercarial production is directly correlated to the duration of cercarial

     USSR.</p>
    <p>As a criterion for parasites age the extent of puberty of some elements of sexual and attach-
     mental systems, biotopical belonging, ability to egg laying and a number of other properties
     were used. As à result of investigations two age groups of bream and three groups of blue bream
     have been distinguished. During the year only two-three generations of these parasites were
     found in populations of bream and blue breem. Thus our results argue against the wide-spread
     belief in a large number of generations of genus Dactylogyrus. The question of the life period
     of parasites on the host has been cleared up. It is shown the life period of parasites on gills
     is greatly dependent on the season of the year. So the matter stands that during the
     spring-summer period monogenies exist on gills for 2-3 months, and the generations passing the
     winter on gills exist for 7 months and even more.</p>

     numerous species of copépods, many of which are both host and attachment site specific. Site
     specificity is usually so narrow that habitat descriptions such as gill, mouth, olfactory bulb,
     and body surface belittle the phenomenon. For example, the gills of elasmobranchs are
     partitioned into at least six realized niches.</p>
    <p>Wiile these niches are physically distinct in many ways, the mechanism responsible for a
     species’ realized location are unknown. As copepod distributions do not change with varying
     species mixing, competition for resources does not seem to be responsible for their site
     specificity. Furthermore, modes of attachment and feeding only minimally explain site
     specificity, as structures associated with such duties seem adequate to alu much wider
     distributions. Interestingly, adult copepods are often tightly clumped.at predictable locations
     not utilizing all of a seemingly homogeneous niche, while larval copepods have a more random
     distribution on their hosts. The development of site specificity in copepods may be driven by
     its ability to increase mating success rather than as a means of resource procurement.</p>

    <p>— Présentation du matériel et de l'importance de la Bothriocéphalose dans les populations de
     turbots en Méditerranée.</p>
    <p>— À partir du cycle biologique du Bothriocéphale, présentations successives du parasite
     adulte, des oeufs, de l'éclosion des oeufs, de la larve nageante, du développement lar- vaire
     chez le Copépode (ler hôte intermédiaire) et enfin du développement larvaire ëhez le poisson
     (2ème hôte intermédiaire).</p>
    <p>— La biologie de l'hôte définitif, en particulier la nature du comportement trophique en
     fonction de l'âge, conditionne l'existence chez le parasite de cycles biologiques diffé- rents
     impliquant ou non un deuxième hôte intermédiaire. Ces différences de cycle se ré- percutent sur
     la dynamique des populations parasites.</p>
    <p>- En conclusion, la "stratégie à géométrie variable" développée par le parasite lui assure un
     maximum de chances face aux pressions, biotiques ou abiotiques,de l'environ- nement.</p>

     Moscow, USSR Toxoplasma-cloning-strain markers Comparative Toxoplasma cloning studies of
     different human strains by mo- dification of the plaque assay revealed considerable
     heteropeneity of newly isolated strains vs homogeneous population structure of old labora- tory
     strain RH. Highly significant correlation was found between patho- genicity trait for mice on
     the one hand and invasiveness in cell culture as well as capacity to develop in macrophages in
     vitro on the other. There was negative correlation between pathopenicity for mice and time
     genera- tion of Toxoplasma. No significant correlation of pathogenicity for mice was found
     either with the plaque size, resistance to Daranrim or capacity to reproduce at 42 C.</p>
    <p>Fence, such genetic features as invasiveness, time peneration and capacity to develop in
     macrophages can be suggested as markers to characterize the degree of strain pathogenicity
     supplementary to virulence trait.</p>

     medium, containing brain-heart infusion, peptone, beef extract &amp; lysed rabbit blood, in an
     atmosphere of 5% CO&gt; and a tempera- ture of 37ÈI &amp; 35? I C. In an experiment of 30 days
     duration, serial cultivation was possible by subculturi every 3 days. leishmenie donovani and
     L. major AA formed TO0% &amp; 20% of the total parasite count by day 6 and viability was
     74.7+0.4% &amp; 71,240,8% respectively. Complete transformation to AA was achieved with L.major
     after 2I days. Both species exhibited 40% viability by day 30. Infectivity studies using BALB/G
     mice &amp; intraperitonial inoculation of L.donovani and L.major (2x10 parasites), revealed
     significant differences in infectivity between AA &amp; P as determined by the appearance of
     parasites in the spleen, parasite count, weight &amp; length of spleen &amp; in addition, time
     of appearance &amp; size of cutaneous lesion in case of intradermal inoc- ulation of L.major.
     Electrophoresis of malic enzyme, malate dehydroge- nese, glucose phosphate isomerase &amp;

    <p>Box 59818, Riyadh, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia Leishmania donovani - L.infantum - Kala-azar -
     Dogs - Epidemiology Kala-azar is a recently recognised public health problem in Saudi Arabia,
     309 cases having been diagnosed in 1988 alone. The disease affects mainly infants in the
     Southwest of the country, either as isolated cases or in case clusters in certain villages
     extending between the foothills of the Asir mountain range and the Red Sea coast.
     Seroepidemiological surveys based on the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) revealed a
     positivity rate of about 3.7% in 706 apparently healthy children.</p>
    <p>The isoenzyme typing of 17 isolates collected from patients in the endemic area showed that
     the causative agent is a so far undescribed member of the Leishmania donovani complex,
     currently labelled zymodeme LON-47. This is readily distinguished from L.infantum which has
     been identified in feral dogs from the same area. In the dogs the infection rate of a sample of
     89 as judged by smear examination of organs and culture was 6.7% but their seropositivity rate
     was 19.3%. The co-existence of two different organisms causing visceral leishmaniasis in this
     area provides a unique epidemiological situation. So far L.infantum has not been identified in
     man in Saudi Arabia but the study which includes an attempt to identify the Phlebotomine
     vectors is continuing.</p>

     Monogenea - Salmo spp. - Salvelinus spp.</p>
    <p>An experimental epidemiological approach was applied to study the susceptibility and
     resistance of Salmon (Salmo salar) (five different stocks), Rainbow trout (Salmo gairdneri),
     Brown trout (Salmo trutta) (one resident and one anadromous stock), Brook trout (Salvelinus
     fontinalis) and Arctic char (Salvelinus alpinus), to the monogenean Gyrodactylus salaris
     Malmberg. The fish were infected in the labora- tory and either individually isolated or kept
     in multi-host systems.</p>
    <p>The parasite numbers were monitored weekly. Experiments with intro- duction of previously
     unexposed fish to infected multi-host systems were also accomplished. The species could broadly
     be separated into groups based on factors as degree of individual host variability, degree of
     parasite population growth, level of and time to peak infection and persistance of infection.
     The different stocks and species demonstrated a high variability in resistance/susceptibility
     traits against G. salaris, from highly susceptible to resistant fishes. The results stress the
     complexity in assessing host spesifi- city and the functional significance of different
     salmonids in the stream community for the population dynamics of Gyrodactylus salaris.</p>

     Johnson, D.M. Spratt. University of Melbourne, Veterinary Clinical Centre, Werribee 3030,
     Victoria, Australia Helminth communities in small macropodids Helminth communities studied to
     date in large macropodids (Macropus/Wallabia) and in the rock wallabies (Petrogale spp.) are
     characterised by a high degree of diversity with the communities being dominated by strongyloid
     nematodes. By contrast, communities in several of the smaller genera of macropodine and
     potoroine marsupials (Aepyprymnus rufescens, Lagorchestes conspicillatus, Onychogalea
     unguifera, Hypsiprymnodon moschatus) are much less diverse and are not invariably dominated by
     strongyloid nematodes, particularly in the case of the protoroines. Since these genera are
     phylogenetically older than Macropus, the data suggests that the complex communities seen in
     Macropus may well have evolved relatively recently.</p>
    <p>By contrast, the helminth community of Thylogale stigmatica, a small macropodine related to
     Petrogale, is extremely diverse and is composed of numerous strongyloid genera found
     exclusively in Thylogale spp. The evolution of its helminth community has an apparently
     different origin to those found in Macropus spp.</p>

    <p>Giardia duodenalis, growth in vitro, comparative growth The in vitro growth behaviour of the
     intestinal protozoan Giardia duodenalis was studied in detail and compared between two
     genetically distinct isolates. A number of cloned populations were derived from each isolate
     and genetic characterization achieved by iso- enzyme analysis. One clone of each isolate was
     selected at random to ensure genetic hom- ogeneity of experimental populations.</p>
    <p>An in vitro culture system was developed in which experimental conditions were standard- ized
     to allow the selective measurement of the parameters of interest. Replicates of each clone were
     grown at 6 different initial cell concentrations and in culture media at 4 different pH
     values.</p>
    <p>Significant differences in the in vitro growth behaviour were found between two genetic- ally
     and biologically distinct isolates, BAHI12 and Pl. BAHI12 was also shown to have a specific
     narrow pH requirement, with satisfactory growth only obtained at pH 6. The mean generation time
     of BAHI2 at pH 6 was 10.8 hours, compared to an average of 6 hours for Pl, which grew equally
     well at pH 6 and pH 7.</p>
    <p>These results provide the first detailed evidence that genetically different isolates of
     Giardia may differ in such fundamental biological parameters as growth rate and pH
     requirements. These differences may have important epidemiological and taxonomic
     implications.</p>

     parasite load, distribution of nodules and kind of skin and lymphatic lesions.</p>
    <p>In the Upper Orinoco Focus, in which Simulium guianense is the main vector, onchocerciasis is
     widespread among yanomami amerindian population.</p>
    <p>This focus is geographically isolated from the Coastal Mountain Foci, in which S. metallicum
     is the main vector.</p>
    <p>Cross infection experiments of S. metallicum with Onchocerca volvulus from the Upper Orinoco
     Focus have shown delayed development and yielded few number (0.883) of L3 larvae. This results
     may indicate the existence of different O. volvulus strains in Venezuela. However caryotypic
     evidence show that S. metallicum in Venezuela is a species complex, whose members may differ in
     its susceptibility to O. volvulus. Research in progress is aimed to study this and other
     factors that affect susceptibility to in - fection of the vector, but also to measure
     transmission potential, in or - der to evaluate the efectiveness of mass ivermectin

    <p>Une série d'enquêtes effectuées tout récemment sur les schistosomoses animales dans la région

    <p>Les observations sur la morphologie des oeufs intra-utérins chez les schistosomes femelles

    <p>(Frpanosoma cruzi, sondes, PCR, kinétoplaste, sang, fécès) Trypanosoma cruzi est Un complexe
     de populations génétiquement très diversifiées à évolution principalement clonale dans la
     nature. Toutefois, les caractéristiques biologiques et médicales de ces clones naturels sont
     inconnues. Actuellement, ces études nécessitent l'isolement des souches (faible rendement chez
     les patients en phase chronique de l'infection), leur amplification en culture et leur
     caractérisation par une étude génétique isoenzymatique multi-locus. Ainsi, des études
     extensives sur de nombreux foyers sont actuellement peu factibles.</p>
    <p>Dernièrement, nous avons montré que les parties variables des minicercles du kinétoplaste de
     T. cruzi peuvent être considérées comme une empreinte des caractéristiques génétiques de chaque
     clone, préalablement définies par 15 loci isoenzymatiques. Ces zones variables sont facilement
     amplifiables par la Réaction de Polymérisation en Chaîne ('PCR"). La "PCR" couplée à
     l'hybridation de ses produits par les sondes spécifiques de clones permet donc une
     caractérisation sensible et directe des clones en évitant la sélection de clones particuliers
     au cours de l'amplification par culture des parasites.</p>
    <p>Nous avons évalué cette technique dans différents échantillons biologiques. Une "PCR"
     positive a été obtenue à partir () de100 ul de sang de souris en phase aiguë ou chronique de
     l'infection (13, 83, 92 jours post infection), (ii) d'organes (rates, vessies) de souris
     infectées, (iii) de 100 ul de sang humain et 10 ul de fécès de triatomes contenant moins de 10
     parasites. Les produits de la PCR séparés par éléctrophorèse et transférés sur membranes sont
     hybridés avec les différentes sondes spécifiques de clones. Dans ces conditions, la spécificité
     de ces sondes est maintenue quel que soit le rendement de la PCR.</p>
    <p>Nous commentons également les dificultées rencontrées en particulier à cause de l'extrême

     diversity Isolates of P. vivax in Sri Lanka are highly polymorphic for many parasite proteins,
     including a schizont surface antigen, PV200. Monoclonal antibodies (Mabs) recognize at least
     six distinct variant epitopes on this protein. These Mabs have been used to analyse the genetic
     diversity of the parasites within individual isolates of P. vivax by examing blood films of
     mature schizonts by IFA. By using different fluorochromes (rhodamine of fluorescein) to
     identity the reaction of each Mab, pairs of Mabs against different variant epitopes of PV200
     could be used to determine whether parasites in an individual isolate were of mixed serotypes
     or homogeneous for a single genotype. Among ten isolates examined with different combinations
     of eight such Mabs, nine isolates appear to be homogeneous for a single serotype, the remaining

     diminuta - Insularity - Population genetic Some characteristics of the insular populations of
     parasites, inherent in the phenomenon of geographical isolation, were analysed in the
     Hymenolepis diminuta / Rattus rattus model-system. Structure and enzymatic polymorphism of
     Hymenolepis diminuta populations were studied in little islands in the vicinity of Corsica.</p>
    <p>The epidemiological data showed a very important invasion by the parasite of the sole "niche"
     (R. rattus). Prevalence and intensity were at least twice higher in the little islands than in
     Corsica itself and in the continent.</p>
    <p>Genetic isoenzyme analyses disclosed a lost of genetic variability in. the different
     islands.</p>
    <p>From those preliminary results, two main conclusions arise: - The origin of the importance of
     H. Giminuta populations in the little islands is to be found in the absence of interspecific
     competition (R. rattus is poorly infected by other helminths) and in the high density of the
     host population which makes parasite transmission more favourable.</p>
    <p>- In each island, the founder effect seems to be very important.</p>
    <p>— H. diminuta populations are isolated in each island and gene flow doesn't seem to occur
     between them.</p>

    <p>Isolement reproductif - Parthénogénèse - Schistosoma japonicum - S. mansoni.</p>
    <p>Des hybrides interspécifiques naturels ont été découverts entre certaines espèces de
     schistosomes. Nous avons voulu connaître le degré d'isolement reproductif entre Schistosoma
     mansoni et S. japonicum, espèces dont l'isolement géographique est tel qu'il rend très
     improbable l'existence d'un flux génique entre elles. Deux types de croisement ontété effectués
     : femelle S. japonicum X mâle $.mansoni et femelle S.mansoni X mâle S. japonicum.</p>
    <p>Dans les deux cas les schistosomes mâles et femelles s'apparient avec un succès identique à
     celui que l'on obtient quand les partenaires sont de la même espèce ; les femelles se
     développent et produisent des œufs fertiles. Les miracidiums obtenus infestent les mollusques
     vecteurs de l'espèce maternelle (Oncomelania hupensis pour S.</p>
    <p>japonicum et Biomphalaria glabrata pour S.mansoni) ; les cercaires émises par ces mollusques
     se développent en adultes fertiles chez la souris. L'utilisation de divers marqueurs,
     biologique (infectivité), biochimique (isoenzymes), éthologique (comportement des miracidiums)
     révèle que les schistosomes obtenus ne sont pas des hybrides, mais des parthénotes. Certaines
     différences non négligeables apparaissent cependant dans le déroulement de la parthénogénèse
     dans les deux types de croisement.</p>
    <p>En conclusion, un isolement reproductif prézygotique authentique sépare ces deux espèces.
     Cependant une interaction demeure possible entre elles. Les femelles de chacune des espèces,
     seules, n'atteignent pas une maturité sexuelle normale et par conséquent sont incapables de se
     reproduire. Nos expériences montrent que les mâles de S. japonicumetde S. mansoni induisent à
     la fois le développement des femelles de l'espèce opposée etune reproduction
     parthénogénétique.</p>

    <p>Leishmania major - Epidemiology - Phlebotomus papatasi - Human - Sinai, Egypt Since October,
     1982, cutaneous leishmaniasis has been repeatedly diagnosed among military members of the
     Multinational Forces and Observers (MFO), an international peace-keeping force based in the
     north Sinai desert. In an effort to assist in the recognition, prevention and treatment of this
     disease among MFO personnel, epidemiological studies were initiated in July, 1989 at locations
     in northeastern Sinai.</p>
    <p>Epidemiological results, based upon dissection of sandflies captured by landing/resting
     collections have identified a single man-biting sandfly species, Phlebotomus papatasi, with
     promastigote infection rates of approximately 0.8% (7/836) during the month of July. From
     cryopreserved sandflies, promastigotes have been successfully cultured in NNN medium and an
     isolate has been shown to produce lesions when inoculated into the footpads of BALB/C mice.
     Amastigotes were observed after Giemsa staining of smears taken from footpad lesions.
     Comparative isoenzyme electrophoresis against WHO reference strains of L. major (LRC-L-137) and
     L. tropica (LRC-L-39) was employed to identify the sandfly isolate and 2 Leishmania isolates
     obtained by aspirate/biopsy. from infected MFO personnel. Based upon à comparison of isoenzyme
     profiles for the five key enzymes PGM, 6PGDH, ACP, MPI and GPI, the three unknown isolates were
     all identified as L. major.</p>

    <p>Oocyst-antibodies-immunoblots Cryptosporidium parvum, an obligate intracellular parasitic
     protozoan with a typical coccidian life-cycle, is a comnon cause of diarrhoea in livestock and
     man, Infection is transmitted from host to host by the faecal-oral route via oocysts, and for
     man a common source of infection is believed to be drinking water contaminated with oocysts
     previously excreted by animals. Cross-infections between other mammals and man have been
     reported, but comparative studies of the characteristics of parasites isolated from different
     species have rarely been published. The object of this study was to compare the polypeptide
     antigens of oocysts of animal and human origin, as recognised by serun from convalescent
     patients, serum from a rabbit immunised with homogenised oocysts in adjuvant, or monoclonal
     antibodies raised against the oocyst. Polypeptides from purified oocysts were subjected to
     SDS-PAGE under reducins conditions and Western blottins.</p>
    <p>The blots were incubated with serum or monoclonal antibodies, washed in buffer, incubated
     with a second antibody conjugated to alkaline phosphatase, and,followins washing, added to
     buffer containing 5-bromo,4-chloro,3-indolyl phosphate and nitroblue tetrazolium for
     visualisation of antisens. The results indicated that although the antigenic patterns of the
     various isolates were similar, some significant differences existed between certain isolates.
     l'or example, a number of differences were found between a cervine isolate from Scotland and a
     human isolate from the south of England.</p>

     clones provide a strong evidence of heterogenicity in a single strain parasite population. No
     morphological variations could be found by light microscopy.</p>
    <p>The use of a hepatocyte feeder layer improves the growth of cloned parasites but does not

    <p>A ten-year study of Pacific herring off northern California showed that parasites could be
     used to separate the spawning populations of San Fran- cisco Bay and Tomales Bay. The
     similarity in parasitism between San Fran- cisco Bay and the non-spawning population in
     Monterey Bay suggests that these two populations represent a single stock.</p>
    <p>Periodic warm-water "El Niño" currents off the California coast decrease oceanic
     productivity. As a result, the nutritional value of the items in the food chain decreases.
     Consumers ingest more food items and get less energy. Some diet-related helminths increased in
     intensity during the "El Niño" event, This may have been the result of increased feéding, hence
     ingesting more infected intermediate hosts.</p>

    <p>À culture of G 49/LIIT was fed through a membrane to laboratory reared 5th instar nymphs of
     Rhodnius prolixus; 49 days thereafter one of these triatomids was immersed for 30 minutes in
     White's solution; its intestinal tract was dissected, found very rich in flagellates (mostly
     epimastisotes) diluted in LIT plus penicillin (200 U/ml) and streptomycin (100 ug/m1l).</p>
    <p>Following Dvorak's technique (1985) 9 clones were obtained and later amplified ïin LIT

    <p>The cultures were prepared for determination of their restriction profiles according to

     by schizodeme analysis.</p>
    <p>The 9 clones could be differentiated in H groups none of them being identical to the mother G
     49/LIIT population. However when put together it could be seen that the profile of the mother
     population included bands of some of the clones.</p>
    <p>These results indicate that G 49/LIII is an heterogeneous population. The clones are being

    <p>Experimental hybridizations between three schistosomes of the terminal spined egg group (S.
     haematobium, S.intercalatum and. bovis) were realized. The chronobiological studies of the
     cercarial emergence rhythms ofthe parental species and of their F1 hybrids are carried out in
     identical experimental conditions and results were analyzed with circular statistics.</p>
    <p>The parental species showed significant differences in their cercarial shedding patterns. The
     cercariae of the F1 hybrids showed the same circadian emergence rhythm as the cercariae of the
     parental species (with one peak), but differ by their mean shedding time which was always in
     advance in comparison with the emergence time of their parental species. These results
     corroborate the genetic determinism of the cercarial emergence of schistosomes. They are
     compared with the results obtained from crosses between schistosomes with lateral spined eggs
     (S. mansoni and S. rodhaini), and from crosses between intraspecific chronobiological variants
     of S. mansoni.</p>
    <p>The significant differences in the times of cercarial emergence between the hybrids and their
     parents could be used in the characterization of natural occurring hybrids. In that way, such
     hybridization markers may be of value in the epidemiological researches.</p>

    <p>L'analyse génétique révèle chez les formes adultes (sexuées) de ces parasites l'existen- ce

     toujours à ce niveau une spécificité stricte (oioxénie). L'étude des structures spatiales et

    <p>Cette étude nous a permis de constater une résistance génétique à l'infestation naturelle.
     Les bovins de race locale sont plus résistants que la race pie noire et à la race croisé. La
     moyenne des nombres de tiques fixées sur les bovins de race locale est réduite de moitié par
     rapport à la pie noire ainsi que le poids des tiques femelles. Cet effet génétique est
     transmissible puisque les animaux croisés résistent mieux que la race pie noire. Sans que l'on
     puisse l'expliquer, l'âge a un rôle particulièrement important.</p>
    <p>Dans les 3 régions, les animaux jeunes resistent mieux que les adultes, quelque soit la race.

    <p>TRANSMISSION DYNAMICS OF HELIGMOSOMOIDES POLYGYRUS IN MIXED STRAIN POPULATIONS OF MICE:
     SIGNIFICANCE OF RESISTANCE AND SUSCEPTIBILITY M.E. Scott, F. Jalili. Institute of Parasitology
     of McGill University, Montreal, Canada Heligmosomoides - transmission - resistance -
     populations BALB/c mice are shown to be more resistant to infection with the trichostrongylid
     nematode, Heligmosomoides polygyrus, when compared with C57BL/6 mice. This was demonstrated
     through two series of experiments, one which compared the establishment, survival and
     reproduction of the parasite following a single controlled infection, and a second in which an
     anthelmintic-abbreviated immunizing regime was used to stimulate protective immunity to a
     challenge infection. It was hypothesized, therefore, that C57BL/6 mice would be more heavily
     infected than BALB/c mice when they lived together as a single population in a large indoor
     arena where transmission occurred through contact between the mice and parasite larvae in the
     substrate of the arena. Fifty female mice of each strain were placed in a 3.2 x 0.8 m arena.
     Five mice of each strain were infected with 200 L3. The arena contained three trays of damp
     peat where parasite eggs and larvae could survive and develop. Egg production was monitored in
     both strains of mice, and uninfected sentinel mice of each strain were placed in the arenas
     every two weeks for 24 hours in order to monitor larval availability. There was little
     difference in infection level between the two strains of mice. These data suggest that there
     are difficulties in direct extrapolation from results of controlled infection of individual
     mice to uncontrolled infection of populations of mice, and may have implications for the
     relative importance of genetics of susceptibility and resistance to infection in more natural
     situations.</p>

    <p>An. stephensi Anopheles stephensi Liston is one of the important carriers of malaria in
     Indian sub-continent. Chromosomal aberrations are of interest because translocations and
     pericentric inversions are associated with high levels of sterility and are potentially useful
     for genetic control measures.</p>
    <p>Anopheles stephensi males were irradiated with 3500 rads of gama rays at the rate of 140
     rads/min to induce chromosomal aberra- tions. Ten reciprocal translocations were isolated,
     including four sex-linked and seven autosomal by using fertility technique. The presence of
     translocations were confirmed by cytological analysis.</p>
    <p>Each translocation heterozygote showed characteristic sterility with little variation.</p>
    <p>To asses the practical application of using chromosomal trans- locations in the genetic
     control programme of An. stephensi, mating competitive test were carried out using semisterile
     males with male- linked translocation T(Y:2L)1 with normal females in the presence of normal
     males in laboratory condition proved that translocated males compete 1.93 percent higher than
     normal males.</p>

    <p>O.viverini ; Enzyme typing.</p>
    <p>Cellulose acetate electrophoresis and enzyme activity staining has proved to be a remarkably
     successful technique in studying the taxonomy of microorganism. Three enzymes namely : glucose
     phosphate isomerase (GPI;EC 5.3.1.9), phosphoglucomutase (PGM;EC 2.7.5.1) and
     glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G-6-PD;EC 1.1.1.49) all in- volved in glucose metabolism
     were studied in the homogenate ground from a single live adult worm of Opisthorchis viverini
     (O0. viverini). Only the live adult worms were collected either from intrahepatic bile ducts of
     autopsy cases or from common bile duct of the patients who had undergone surgical operations. À
     total of 109 worms from human sources together with 59 worms from infected hamsters were
     analyzed. Eight different patterns of GPI (GPl1-8); five PGM patterns (PGM/_5) and three
     patterns for G-6-PD (G—6-PD1_3) were identified. As a result, the 168 worms were then typed
     into forty seven types based on three isoenzyme polymorphic patterns.</p>

    <p>The genotypic variation of five populations of Dermacentor reticulatus (Fabricius, 1794),
     four from West Wales and one from the South of France, was examined electrophoretically using
     two enzyme markers, phosphoglucomutase (PGM) and isocitrate dehydrogenase (ICD). The results
     suggest that little intra- or interpopulation variation occurs and this finding is consistent
     with other studies on enzyme variation in ticks. The phenotypic variation was also examined
     using image analysis of the scutal pattern of adults.</p>

     Australia Haemonchus contortus, genetic resistance, nematodes, sheep Two lines of Merinos have
     been selected since 1978 on the basis of faecal egg counts following artificial infection with
     Haemonchus contortus larvae. One line is selected for increased (IRH) and another for decreased
     (DRH) resistance. An unselected control line (CH) is also maintained for comparison.</p>
    <p>The three lines are grazed together as one flock except for five weeks at mating and for a
     similar period during lambing. After weaning in summer at an average age of 105 days, faecal
     samples were taken from 30 lambs in each line. Geometric mean egg counts were 280, 1863 and 887
     eggs per gram in the IRH, DRH and CH lines, respectively. Although egg counts differed
     significantly (P&lt;0.05), the proportions of Trichostrongylus colubriformis (48%), Ostertagia
     circumcincta (47%) and Oesophagostomum spp. (5%) eggs were similar in each line.</p>
    <p>These results imply that selection of sheep for resistance to H. contortus will improve their
     resistance to other nematode species at an early age. À separate experiment is in progress to
     determine whether T. colubriformis and H. contortus can adapt to genetically resistant sheep
     which are managed separately.</p>

     survey of pigs,domestic cats and wild cats(Felis bengalensis and Viverricula indica)naturally
     infected with Clonorchis sisensis in Fujian Province;Jiu- jian Shi,Jiangxi and Hongze
     District,Jiangsu,China.889 animals were examined for the parasite and among them 651 pigs,103
     cats and 135 wild cats were examined respectively.</p>
    <p>Their infection rates in order are 5.6-28%, 29.1-44% and 20-53% with an average of 18.13 %,
     37.9% and 38.52%. The results of examinations showed that in the above districts, both pigs and
     wild cats are the same as dogs and cats,which are an important reservoir host for the
     trematode, They act as transmission for the prevalence of clonorchiasis.</p>
    <p>The morphological observation resealed that the ovary of the adult worm parasitzing Felis
     bengalensis was almost deeply lobate and nearly brabch-shaped.The shapes of this ovary differ
     from those described by investigators in the general texbook.This difference probaly has
     something to do with the different species of the deffinitive hosts.</p>

    <p>Malaria, Anopheles culicifacies, Iran Malaria is the most important health problem in
     Baluchistan, Iran, where Anopheles culicifacies Giles sensu lato is regarded as the main
     vector.</p>
    <p>Anopheles culicifacies complex comprises at least four biologically dis- tinct sibling
     species, designated as species A, B, C and D, which are distinguishable by the species specific
     paracentric inversions observ- able in the polytene chromosomes of the ovarian nurse cells.</p>
    <p>In order to investigate the occurrence of the sibling species of Anoph- eles culicifacies
     s.1l. in Iran, semi-gravid females were collected from five different locations in Baluchistan
     during September-October 1987 and May-June 1988, Polytene chromosome preparations of the
     ovarian nurse cells revealed the existance of only species A in this country, which corresponds
     well with epidemiological conditions of malaria in the area. This report extends the westward
     distribution of species A into Iran.</p>

    <p>Biochemical taxonomy - isoenzymes - sibling species Three sibling species were recently
     discovered within the sealworm Pseudoterranova decipiens, and provisionally designated
     P.decipiens A, B, and C (Orecchia et al., 1988; Paggi et al., 1988). They can be easily
     identified at any life stage and in both sexes on the basis of several enzyme loci, that show
     distinct alleles in the three species.</p>
    <p>In the present study, further data are given on the genetic variation at 16 enzyme loci of
     P.decipiens s.1. collected from fish and seals at 23 sampling locations in the North Atlantic
     and Norwegian and Barents seas. Among the 1017 specimens tested, no introgressed individuals
     were found, but only one F1 hybrid (between P.decipiens À and B); this confirms that the three
     species are reproductively isolated. Nei's genetic distance is 0.44 between P.decipiens À and
     B, 0.57 between B and C, and 0.79 between À and C. In the North-East Atlantic, P.decipiens À is
     most common in the grey seal, Halichoerus grypus, while the harbour seal, Phoca vitulina, is
     the main host for P. P.decipiens B. In Canadian Atlantic waters, where P.decipiens À is
     apparently absent, P. decipiens B infects both grey and harbour seals; a few specimens were
     also found in the hooded seal, Cystophora cristata. P.decipiens C hes been detected both in the
     North-West Atlantic and Barents Sea; its only definitive host so far identified is the bearded
     seal, Erignathus barbatus.</p>

     schistosomiasis a Fortaleza, ville de 1° État du Cearä. La schistosomiasis au Cearä était une
     endemie rural jusqu'a a 1985, a cette date on a décrit le premier cas infecté par transmission
     autochtone dans la ville de Fortaleza. Aux dernières années, des enquêtes épidémiologiques ont
     montréæ que la maladie est installée dans la banlieue, sans instalations sanitai res primaires,
     habitée par la population de basse rente originaire dans sa majorité de la campagne. La
     migration vers la ville est arrivée pen dant la période de 1979 a 1984, due a la sécheresse qui
     a frappée cette région. Même si les taux d' infection ne soit pas elevées ( 4%) et des formes
     graves n'ont pas eté observées, il y a le risque de dissemination de la maladie, due les
     precaires conditions sanitaires ou elle existe.</p>
    <p>Malgré le controle par medicament et le fait que le seul vecteur, qu'exis te dans la région,
     est Biomphalaria straminea, connu comme un mauvais transmisseur, il est interessant de noter Îa
     existence de nouveaux foyers comme celui-ci et d'autres a l'interieur de l'État. Dans ce
     travail on a etudié las mouvements migratoires et la population autochtone, ( äge , sexe,
     profession, habitudes), l'infection des mollusques vecteurs, qui est trés faible (0,5%) et les

    <p>Moufflon - helminths - Alpine habitat In Italy moufflon (ovis musimon) from its natural range
     has be en introduced into many Alpine areas. Nevertheless, no data are available on its
     parasites in this specific context. This survey was carried out to assess the helminthic fauna
     of moufflon from such as habitat and to evaluate a possible interference in parasitic pattern
     by other ruminants, mainly chamois. Thirty-one moufflon, from a total population of about a
     hundred head, and 14 chamois, living in sympatric conditions in Orobiche Pre-Alps, were
     studied. The animals, culled during fall-winter 1987-88,were of different sex and age. In all
     23 species of helminths were identified in both hosts. In moufflon, 9 species were found not
     previously observed in his natural range (Sardinia), even in a limited sample (Corticelli e
     Lai, 1972, Parass. 14: 96-96; Arru et al.1987, Atti S.I.S.Vet. 4: 1169-117); of thesé, only
     Nematodirus rupicaprae had to be related to chamois. For the other ones, all recovered in the
     chamois, an interference with domestic animals, grazing in the study area in summer time, had
     not to be excluded. Haemonchus contortus and Moniezia expansa, present in chamois, were not
     found in moufflon,in spite of the bibliography (Boch J. Horchner F. 1962,
     Berl.Munch.Tierarztl.Wschr.,75: 325-328; Bidovec A. 1985, Zb. Biotech. Fak. Univ. Ljublijani 2:
     175-185). The most species common to both hosts are Ostertagia circumcincta and Nematodirus

    <p>À la faveur de ces découvertes, les auteurs adoptent la synonymie du genre Coeuritrema et

    <p>Les deux espèces africaines partagent un seul caractère dérivé (oeuf tricorné), mais H.

    <p>Quant à l'intrusion des Hapalorhynchus sur le continent africain, la nature exceptionnelle de

     quelquefois importants et même élevés en particulier dans un haut lieu de rassemblement de

    <p>Les données concernant le nombre des cas (numérateur)proviennent du recueil prospectif
     national organisé par le CNRMI. Celles concernant le nombre de sujets exposés à la transmission
     du paludisme (dénominateur) ont été obtenues auprès des services de statistiques des diverses
     aéroports assurant les liaisons avec les pays situés en zone d'endémie.</p>
    <p>Les taux d'attaque sont très différents selon les continents visités : 2 pour 10 000 en
     Amérique Latine, 8 pour 100.000 en Asie, et 50 pour 10.000 en Afrique subsaharienne. Ces taux
     peuvent être précisés par pays pour l'Afrique Noire où le risque est le plus élevé. Les risques
     calculés à partir des données de 1988, pour ce continent, révèlent une grande disparité
     régionale. En effet, le risque est estimé à 170 pour 10.000 pour la région regroupant les 5
     pays suivants : Côte d'Ivoire, Burkina Faso, Ghana, Togo et Bénin.Il est environ de moitié (%
     et pour 10.000) pour les pays d'Afrique centrale équatoriale. Les risques les plus faibles (7 à
     1/10.000) correspondent à la zone sahélienne. La dynamique de ces taux de 1987 à 1988 montre
     une stabilité pour toutes les régions hormis pour l'Afrique de l'Ouest et les Comores. Pour ces
     dernières, il semble s'agir d'un cas particulier de déplacement d'une population d'enfants
     comoriens. Par contre, entre ces deux années, le risque a plus que doublé (multiplié par 2,5)
     après un séjour en Afrique de l'ouest. Certes, l'hypothèse d'une intensification de la
     transmission vectorielle ne peut être écartée. Cependant, les pays contribuant pour l'essentiel
     à cette augmentation du risque correspondent aux régions où la récente chloroquinorésistance
     est encore en pleine expansion. Dans tous les cas, l'application des mesures préventives par
     les voyageurs (protection individuelle contre les piqûres de moustiques et chimioprophylaxie
     adaptée suivant le niveau de chloroquinorésistance) devraient, à l'avenir, réduire les taux
     d'attaque d'accès palustres après un séjour en zone d'endémie.</p>

     Africa and from Swaziland (26 local- ities in all) and representing 50 species in 9 families
     were checked for opalinids in the cloaca. Bodian's protargol was used for staining. The genus
     Opalina was found in one species of Chiromantis and one of Phrynobatrachus. The genus
     ZeTTeriella was recov- ered from two species of Bufo, two of Kassina, one of Leptopelis, one of
     Phrynobatrachus, one of Phrynomerus and four of Tomopterna. The genus Cepedea was detected in
     one species of Afrixalus, three of Bufo, one of Chiromantis, one of Heleo HeTeophryne, five of
     Hyperolius, two of Kassina, one of Phrynobatrachus, one of one of Phrynomerus, one of
     Semnodactylus and four of Tomopterna. Protoopalina was present in six species of Bufo, one of
     Cacosternum, one of Capensibufo, one of Heleophryne, four of Ptychadena, one of Pyxicephalus,
     two of Rana, one of Schismaderma, one of Strongylopus and two of Xenopus. À new genus is pro-
     posed for a Zelleriella- îke opalinid occurring in Capensibufo rosei from the Cape Pen- insula
     and characterized by an area devoid of kineties at the periphery of the cell. In the
     Afrotropical Zoogeographical Region, Opalina seems to be restricted to the Ranidae and the
     Rhacophoridae. It is suggested that Kassina and Tomopterna are among the major carriers of
     Zelleriella. Hyperolius and Tomopterna are among the major carriers of Cep- edea. Bufo,
     Cacosternum, Ptychadena, Rana and Strongylopus are among the major carriers of

     alimentary tract were washed and worms collecte Or examination. OM 375 sets of specimens 286
     (76%) were positive for helminthic infection ,66% being cows and 80% being sheep and goats. À
     total of 46 species were identified consisting five of cestoda (Hlicometra giardi,Moniezia
     expansa,M.benedeni,Avitellina centripunctata ,Stilesia globipunctata)one of trematoda
     (Paramphistomum cervi), one of Pentastomid larva and others nematoda ,including: five species
     Trichostrongylus, seven Nematodirus, tow Bunostomum, tow Oesophagostomum, three Cooperia, tow
     Haemonchus , five Ostertagia, Six Trichuris and one species from Chabertia, Marshallagia,
     Gongylonema, Teladorsagia , Parabronema, Strongyloides and Skerjabinema.</p>
    <p>Our’s was the first study to identify these species in this region, to report existence of
     Cooperia mcmasteri from Iran and to find Oesophagostomum radiatum in the gastro-intestinal
     tract of sheep which is otherwise a common parasite of cow . We have also detected six more
     species (one Trichostrongylus sp. one Nematodirus sp. four Trichuris sp. ) that remain
     unidentified as yet, probably those are new species.</p>

    <p>Barcelona, 08028 Barcelona, Spain Biogeography - Nematodes - Rodents - Iberian Peninsula The
     helminthological study of 5.435 Rodents (250 Sciurids, 155 Glirids, 3.076 Murids and 1.954
     Arvicolids) proceeding from different regions of the Iberian Peninsula has permitted to
     determine quite exactly the geographical peninsular distribution of their parasite Ne- matodes
     (37 species altogether). The helminths can be divided in five groups: a) Nemato- des widely
     distributed throughout Iberia; in the said group appear, especially, the para- sites of
     Muridae; b) species to be found also all over the Iberian Peninsula, though much more
     frequently in the northern half; a group formed by parasite helminths of the garden dormouse,
     Eltomys quercinus (Gliridae), of the fieldmouse, Apodemus sylvaticus (Muridae), and of the
     Arvicolid species; c) an unusual case in the one of the Syphabulea mascomat (Oxyuridae),
     parasite of Scturus vulgaris (Sciuridae) since it is only to be found in the Centre and the
     South of the Iberian Peninsula; d) something similar, but inversely, occurs with 4onchotheca
     wioletti (Trichuridae), Gallegostrongylus thicensits (Angiostrongylidae) and Syphacia
     petrusewicat (Oxyuridae) that only parasite Murids and Arvicolids inthe nor- thern half of the
     Peninsula; e) the last group comprises the species of very localized dis- tribution in the
     Iberian Peninsula, Paraheligmonina gracilis (Heligmonellidae), Aonchothe- ca sp. (Trichuridae),
     and Péerygodermatites hispaniea (Rictulariidae). The results obtai- ned are a consequence of
     the interaction of bioecological factors connected both to the parasites (nature of their life
     cycle, specificity) and their hosts (geographical distri- bution, food, ethologies, origin).
     Besides it is undeniable that the geographical location of the Peninsula, within the Paleartic
     Region, also has an influence, above allin the ca- se of Arvicolids and in Glts glis
     (Gliridae).</p>

     dropping samples collected in Piedmont were these birds are in a worrying rate. The research
     for yeasts was carried out by Wickerham's method. The following species were identified using
     Barnett's and Krieger-van Rij's keys: Candida albicans, C.boidinii, C.humicola, C.lambica,
     C.lusitaniae, C.lypolitica, C.kefir, C.ckusei, C.norvegicez, C.parapsilosis, C.pelliculosa,

     beigelii, T.capitatum, T.penicillatum, T.pullulans, Zygosaccharomyces sp. Several of these
     yeasts are agents of mycotic diseases associated with severe immunodeficiency syndromes as
     A.I.D.S. and drug addictions. Since sea-gulls and Corvidae are found out as carriers of
     pathogenic yeasts for the first time in Italy, public health implications of the results are

    <p>Depuis 1985 le CNRMI recueille de façon prospective, à l'aide, d'un réseau de laboratoires
     Sentinelles, un certain nombre de cas de paludisme qui représentent 35 % de l'ensemble des cas
     survenus en métropole.</p>
    <p>L'analyse et le suivi de cette surveillance contribuent à informer le corps médical sur les
     thérapeutiques préventives et curatives, ainsi que le public qui doit être sensibilisé aux
     risques encourus et en mâne temps éduqué sur les diverses mesures préventives.</p>
    <p>Les données montrent l'augmentation de l'incidence annuelle, qui passe de 2308 cas en 1984 à
     environ 4800 cas en 1988, le nanbre le plus élevé est toujours enregistré en Ile de France (50
     à 60 % du total), c'est aussi dans cette région qu'on enregistre le taux d'incidence annuel le
     plus élevé (20 pour 100.000 habitants).</p>
    <p>La population concernée est celle des adultes jeunes, essentiellement des hommes de 20-40
     ans. Le pourcentage des enfants se situe actuellement autour de 20 %. La proportion des
     Français ne cesse d'augmenter (4H % en 1985, 64 % en 1988).</p>
    <p>La contamination se fait surtout en Afrique Noire qui voit sa contribution au paludisme
     d'importation augnen- ter de 79% en 1985 à 95% en 1988. La part de l'Afrique de l'Ouest
     progresse et devient prépondérante en 1988 (50 % des cas).</p>
    <p>La prédominance du P. falciparum passe de 76% en 85 à 85% en 87 et 88 et davantage de cas
     sont étiquetés chloroquinorésistants : 8% en 85, 35% en 88.</p>
    <p>L'augmentation de l'incidence annuelle, de la part de P. falciparum et de la résistance
     déclarée et ce, malgré une chimioprophylaxie de mieux en mieux suivie (22% en 85, 15% en 88)
     témoigne d'une incontestable évolution de la chimiorésistance des souches qui s'exprime
     préférentiellement chez des sujets non prémmnis.</p>

    <p>HIGH SEROPREVALENCE OF TOXOPLASMA GONDII IN LEON, NICARAGUA.</p>

    <p>Toxoplasma gondii, seroprevalence, Nicaragua The ocurrence of Toxoplasma gondii has been
     documented in a number of reports worldwide, yet the epidemiological pattern is far from being
     complete. In Central and South America the seroprevalence appears to be generally high. There
     are no reports from Nicaragua. The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence of
     toxoplasma antibodies in young adults from the city of Leon, Nicaragua.</p>
    <p>i : A total of 216 blood sera was collected at a health center in Leon; 76 sera were from
     blood donors, all males over 30 years of age and 140 samples from pregnant women with an
     average age of 24 years. It was not possible to match age and sex in this retrospective
     investigation. The sera were screened for IgG anti-toxoplasma antibodies with the direct
     agglutination test and positive samples further investigated by immunosorbent agglutination
     assay for IgM class anti-toxoplasma antibodies and the indirect immunofluorescence technique
     using class-specific conjugates for IgG and IgM class anti- toxoplasma antibodies.</p>
    <p>Results: The over all seropositivity was 82% (178/216). The seropositivity amongst the blood
     donors was 92% (70/76), amongst the pregnant women 77% (108/140). There was a good agreement
     between the results obtained with the different assays. IgM anti-toxoplasma antibodies was not
     detected in any of the 178 seropositive cases.</p>
    <p>Conclusion: The high prevalence of anti-toxoplasma antibodies is well in agreement with other
     reports from Central America. The difference of 15 % between the two groups can be explained by
     the difference in age. It might also be explained by the difference in sex, males have been
     shown to have higher seroprevalences for Toxoplasma gondii previously. Detailed epidemiologigal
     information calls for further investigations.</p>

    <p>LOW SEROPREVALENCE OF TOXOPLASMA GONDII IN A TANZANIAN VILLAGE.</p>

    <p>Toxoplasma gondii, seroprevalence, immunoblotting, Tanzania The purpose of this study was to
     compare the seroprevalence of Toxoplasma gondii ina Tanzanian village where neïther pork nor
     sheep were eaten and where cats were not kept as pets with previous reports from Tanzania of
     77, 42 and 40 % seroprevalence respectively.</p>
    <p>Material and methods: Nyamisati is a rural, mainly muslim community in the delta of the
     Rufiji. There are few felines in the surrounding area. Bloodsamples from each subject over two
     years of age (n=483) was collected . The sera were screened for toxoplasma antibodies with the
     direct agglutination test. Positive samples were further investigated by immunosorbent
     agglutination assay and indirect immunofluorescence using class-specific conjugates for IgG and
     IgM. The results were confirmed by the dye test and immunoblotting.</p>
    <p>Results: The overall seropositive rate was 7 %. All results correlated. IgM anti-toxoplasma
     antibodies was not detected in any case. In immunoblotting all positive had a band in the 32 KD
     region and most of them also in the 25 kD region while the negative sera showed a faint and
     irregular pattern. The seroprevalence amongst christians and muslims altogether was (40,9 and
     5,4 %) but in the group of immigrants to the village, 47 subjects, the toxoplasma sero-
     prevalence was 60,0 % in the muslim group and 42,8 % in the christian group.</p>
    <p>Conclusion: Religion appears to be of minor importance for the spread of toxoplasmosis in the
     village. The low seroprevalence is suggested to be due to abscence of contaminated food and a
     low oocyst impact in earth as a consequence of few felines.</p>

    <p>161 Cuots (Fulica atra) shot in Nortnern Italy were used to study correlations between
     biometrical measures and species and numbers of intestinal parasites.</p>
    <p>Due to the method of capture 46 Coots were unuseful for at least one biometrical record and
     74 for parasitology. Only for 59 Coots it was possible to take both biometrics and parasites.
     Biometrical data were: body mass, maximum Wing chord, third primary, tarsus length, tarsusttoe,
     bill length (from skull, from feathers). The parasite species found, their prevalence and mean
     intensity were: Cotilurus cornutus, 1.1%, 10; Echinocasmus sp., 4.64, 1.7; Psilostomum fulicae,
     25.3%, 2.2; Notocotylus gibbus, 32.24%, 10.9; Notocotylus spp., 3.43%, 73; Cloacotaenia
     megalops, 2.33, 1; Diorchis ransomi, 9.23%, 7.5; Family Hymenolepididae, 19.5%, 5.2;
     Amidostomum acutum, 2.3%; 1.5; Amidostomum anseris, 3.44, 4.7; Amidostomum fulicae, 1.13%, 1;
     Capillaria anatis, 3.4%, 4.3; Filicollis anatis, 9.2+, 6.6. Biometrical data were submitted to
     principal components (P.C.) analysis and gave rise to 2 P.C.: maximum wing chord and third
     primary length on the second P.C., the others on the first. The only correlations observed were
     between N.gibbus and the st P.C. (r=-0.262, 2 tailed P=0.045) and F.anatis and the 1st P.C.
     (r=-0.323, 2 tailed P=0.013). All the parasite frequency distributions did not significantly
     differ from the Negative Binomial model (Kolmogorov-Smirnov one sample test, P&gt;0.05), whilst
     differed from the Poisson model except C.cornutus, Echinocasmus sp., C.megalops, A.acutum,
     A.anseris, A.fulicae, C.anatis, probably due to low prevalence and mean intensity.</p>

    <p>Podarcis pityusensis (Boscäâ, 1883) (Sauria: Lacertidae) is an endemic lizard living in
     Eivissa and Formentera islands (Balearic Islands, Spain)(**).</p>
    <p>Some subspecies often living in different rocky isles and so geographically isolated, have
     been described.</p>
    <p>P. pityusensis show a helminth community consisting of more than 10 species. The global
     prevalence for this lizard is near 80%. The different populations of P. pityusensis differs
     with respect to the diversity of their communities and respect to the prevalences. These
     prevalences varies among 52,4% (population of Es Penjat) and 100% (some populations). Partial
     prevalen- ces of each helminth species and also their intensities of infestation are given and
     discussed. These quantitative results are in line with formulated hypothesis about insular
     parasitic faunas saying that high population densities of the host involve an increase of the
     prevalence and intensity of infestation of their parasites.</p>

    <p>ARRESTED DEVELOPMENT: A BIOGEOGRAPHICAL FEATURE OF ANCYLOSTOMES J. Jedlicka, Institute of
     Tropical Health, Ruska 85, 100 05 Prague 10 Czechosiovakia Ancylostomatidae, Ancylostoma
     duodenale, "arrested development" To adopt appropriate surveillance strategy against the spread
     of encylo- stomiasis in infection free areas, "arrested development" fenomenon found by Schad
     et al. in India, 1973, must be taken into account by epidemiologists. It was postulated that
     prolonge prepatent period (up to 40 weeks) in Ancylostoma duodenale is a fixed adaptation
     mecha- nism of this nematode to a seasonally unfavorable environment. Medico- -geographical
     study, which has been carried out in order to compare hookworms distribution on the earth with
     the monsoon regime areas confirmed the global coexistence between these two entities in the
     case of Ancylostoma duodenale but not in the case of Necator americanus.</p>
    <p>This finding is in absolute concordance with biological differences between Ancylostomatidae.
     Important conclusion can be drawn for para- sitological screening of newcomers from infected
     areas. Since the infection may be undetectable by routine coprologic techniques and more- over
     untreatable by otherwise efficient anthelminthics during the hypo- biotic stage of the
     parasite, coprologic examination should be perfor- med at least 40 weeks after leaving an
     endemic area. This approach seems to be necessary for reducing the reendemization risk of
     ancylo- stomiasis in newly introduced foci.</p>

     fish copepods, zoogeography, epipelagic 108 species 39 genera 11 families appeared to be
     available for zoogeo- graphical analysis of parasitic copepods of the World ocean epipelagic
     fish including our own and literature data. They distributed by five zo- ogeographical regions
     in the following way: in the South-boreal - 35 species 23 genera 10 families, Northern
     subtropical - 81 species 36 ge- nera 12 families, Tropical - 94 species 35 genera 13 families,
     Southern subtropical - 47 species 27 genera 11 families and Notal - 32 species 21 genera 10
     families. All the regions are isolated from each other at a level of species, except Southern
     subtropical and Notal. At a level of genera, Northern subtropical and South-boreal, Southern
     subtropical and Notal, South-boreal and Notal regions do not differ. A11 the regions are
     identical at a level of families. The following regularities are obser- ved in distribution of
     epipelagic parasitic copepods of sea fish: a) by direction from equator to poles the decrease
     of a species quantity is observed; b) faunas of subtropical regions are derivatives of Tropical
     and fauna of parasitic fish copepods of Tropical region influence very much on those of
     subtropical and temperate and at the same time this in- fluence is much more stronger in
     Northern hemisphere than in Southern one. In the whole, parasitic fish copepods - as a part of
     the World oce- an fauna, show just the same regularities in distribution as free-li- ving
     organisms as well.</p>

    <p>Historical and modern research on the biogeography of helminth parasites of marine fish is
     summarised rela‘:ive to 3 features of host biology (sex and state of maturity, age and feeding
     behaviour) and one abiotic feature (temperature). Examples are given which show the dominant
     influence of these features on the numbers and distribution of helminth parasites in the marine
     environment. Important applied and academic aspects of this research are tabulated and
     discussed, and those areas most in need of further research are highlighted.</p>

     Department of Fisheries and Oceans, Biological Sciences Branch, Pacific Biological Station,
     Nanaimo, B.C., Canada VIR 5K6 Trematodes, population markers steelhead trout Application of
     biogeographical data on parasites of anadromous salmonids to the solution of national and
     international fisheries problems related to stock identification and migrations has become an
     accepted technique since first introduced 35 yr ago. In the present study 2 freshwater (fw)
     trematodes, Nanophyetus salmincola metacercariae and adult Plagioporus shawi, proved useful for
     determining the North Pacific Ocean distribution of anadromous steelhead trout (Oncorhynchus
     mykiss, formerly Salmo gairdneri) originating in fresh waters of the Pacific Northwestern
     U.S.A. from Washington to northern California. O0. mykiss has a North American fw range
     extending from California to Alaska, and an Asian range that includes the east and west coasts
     of Kamchatka and northern Okhotsk Sea coast in the USSR, but only in the U.S. Pacific Northwest
     does this salmonid occur in the same watersheds as the obligate first intermediate hosts of the
     2 parasites, Juga plicifera for N. salmincola and Fluminicola virens for P. shawi. The 2
     trematodes are acquired by juvenile O.</p>
    <p>mykiss prior to seaward migration and survive through much or all of the trout's sea life.
     Both trematodes, therefore, possess the essential biological traits to ensure their value as
     natural tags for studies on ocean distribution of specific stock groups of anadromous
     salmonids: (a) restricted fw distribution, (b) a fw life cycle precluding inter-host transfer
     at sea, and (c) a long life span including survival during the marine life of the fish host.
     Based on the occurrence of the 2 trematodes in ocean-caught 0. mykiss, stocks from the U.S.
     Pacific Northwest were determined to have a broad spring and summer ocean distribution from the
     eastern Pacific to 167°E in the western Pacific north of about 40°N.</p>

    <p>Afin de évaluer la présence d'amibes libres dans les eaux du Nord-Ouest d'Espagne, les
     auteurs ont réalisé entre 1984 et 1989 une étude de 168 prélevements.</p>
    <p>Ces prélevements ont été effectués à partir de -13 fleuves -17 fontaines -14 piscines -12
     stations balnéaires -11 plages et estuaires -6 marques comerciales différentes d'eaux minerales

     ont été réalisés et filtrés sous vide. Les filtres récuperés ont été mis en culture à 27°C sur
     gélose à 2% monoxénique, avec Escherichia coli autoclavés comme unique source nutritive.</p>
    <p>84% des échantillons ont été positifs parmi lesquels on a isolé 1/71 souches d'amibes libres
     : 73 du genre Acanthamoeba, 35 du genre Valhkampfia, 33 du genre Naegleria et 77 d'autres
     differents genres.</p>
    <p>A part les échantillons provenants des sources d'eaux minerales, le taux d'amibes libres

     Corsica Epidemiological studies carried out on Fascioliasis on Corsica have shown the role of
     Rat- tus rattus as a normal definitive host of F. hepatica, this phenomenon being the
     consequen- ce of insularity concerning niche widening in both host and parasite species.
     Investigations followed from 1984 to 1989 on the mouth of the Fango river allowed the capture
     of 73 rats, of wich 35 were harbouring the parasite (prevalence: 47,9%), ranging from 1 to 12
     digene- an individuals per rat (mean: 3,5). No differences were found concerning host sex in
     pre- valences and mean intensity of infection per rat. Concerning the relationship between in-
     tensity of infection and host age (= rat weight), today data only show that male rats of
     100-150 g and female rats of 100-120 g were harbouring all the parasites found. Parasiti- zed
     rats were detected in March (44,47), May (76,9%) and June (50%). The parasites develop and
     reach the maturity inthe rat main hepatic ducts without problems. No important patho- logic
     effects were seen in the liver, the main hepatic duct showing a large dilatation of its
     diameter. Gravid adults in Corsican rats are largely smaller than in cattle and sheep, sucker
     ratio remaining howewer within the same values. Eggs of rat digeneans were also sig- nificantly
     smaller than eggs of ruminant parasites. Eggs expelled in rat feces develop an inner miracidium
     capable of normal hatching when exposed to appropriate temperature. Besi- des morphology,
     species and strain characterization was undertaken by means of starch gel electrophoresis. À
     total of 23 enzymatic systems were tested, twenty of wich showing a good activity. Only slight
     differences in 6 systems (AK, CK, EST, HK, MPI, 6-PGD) were found when comparing F. hepaticea
     adults coming from rats and fige both of Corsic ca.</p>

     Studies carried out during more than 16 years on the helminthfauna of mammals of the Ibe- rian
     Peninsula allow to reach interesting biogeographic conclusions. Insectivora: Talpi- dae show a
     clearly impoverished helminthfauna when comparing to Europe, excepting Gale- mys pyrenaicus.
     Soricinae reduce the presence of endemisms almost exclusively to the Py- renean chain, whereas
     Crocidurinae harbour endemic species all along peninsular Spain.</p>
    <p>Erinaceidae seem to have lost most of their own helminths. Rodentia: The peridomestic Murids
     show no unusual helminths. Mus spretus has a poor frame with one endemism. Apode- mus
     sylvaticeus offers a large number of helminth species, with some Pyrenean Trematode endemisms.
     Among Arvicolidae, differences can be distinguished between hosts of European origin and
     Iberian endemic species, with a few endemic helminths in both groups. Among Gliridae, Eltomys
     quercinus harbours a rich helminthological frame including several en- demisms. Chiroptera:
     Several endemisms among Digenea, Cestoda and Nematoda have been found, the Hymenolepidids being
     worth mentioning. Rhinolophus ferrumequinum show an im- poverished helminth frame when compared
     to Europe. The same conclusion is reached in M- ntopterus schretberst, a fact not easy to
     understand when thinking at its presumed tro- pical origin. Carnivora: Felidae and Herpestidae
     harbour very poor parasitofaunas, whe- reas among Viverridae Genetta genetta is very rich,
     above all in Cestodes. Canidae and Mustelidae are slightly impoverished in relation to Europe.
     Lagomorpha: Oryctolagus cu- niculus and Lepus spp. show poor helminth frames in Spain when
     compared to Europe. The fre- quence of particular species, rare in other parts of Europe, such
     as Passalurus nonanu- latus, the presence of typical African species such as Wematodiroides
     zembrae and the existence of two endemic Anoplocephaloïides spp., are worth mentioning.</p>

     - Monogenea The distribution area of the marine species of the family 2iyectaniaae is delimited
     by the 15°C isotherm in the S and, in the N, by the 10°C isotherm in the Atlantic and the 15°C
     isotherm in the Sea of Japan Their predominance in the tropical-subtropical zone is
     statistically significant.</p>
    <p>The sub-family Æhabcosymochinae is represented by one monospecific genus localized on the
     coasts of the Gulf of Mexico. The sub-family #fsray#emafoidnae is restricted to the
     Indo-Pacific zone.</p>
    <p>The biogeography of the sub-family 2jyectaninae is similar to that of the family.</p>
    <p>The absence of the genus /amelodscus on the genus Djod/s from the Atlantic coasts of America
     poses a biogeographical problem. According to DELAPAZ ef a/ (1972) American 2joaus derive from
     the sziws group. Djoduys are sea-shore fish and their common stock undoubtedly continuously
     occupied the two shores of the primitive Atlantic ; it would seem that his stock was divided
     into two fauna by the definitive opening of the Atlantic. The genus Zame/odscus perhaps
     appeared on Old World coasts after the separation of these two fauna.</p>
    <p>In view of parasitic specificity, the biogeogaphy of a parasite is a “second degree”
     biogeography. lt is inevitably included in that of the host(s), but some factors (particularly
     temperature) may restrict the distribution of a parasite in relation to that of the host.</p>
    <p>The very wide distribution of the genus /dectanum seems to correspond to what can be regarded
     as the Manter Rule : "genera with both marine and freshwater species often have very wide
     geogaphical distribution" (MANTER, 1955).</p>

     Vulpes vulpes, Discriminant Analysis, Spatial patterns, Climatic factors On the scale of world,
     the biogeographic distribution of Echinococcus multilocularis is well known: cold areas in the
     northern hemisphere. On a different scale (more ecological), the distribution patterns on the
     boundaries of the spread area and the features of the boundaries'environment may inform us
     about the ecology of the parasite.</p>
    <p>148 foxes, (Vulpes vulpes) were killed in Cantal department and 150 in Haute-Savoie; sampling
     pressure was roughly constant. Catching stations were precisely known, and consequently their
     altitude (from 1/50,000 maps of the Institut Géographique National) and climatic parameters:
     annual minimal and maximal temperatures, precipitation (from the Météorologie Nationale; some
     values were extrapolated between two meteorological stations, making allowance for altitude and
     side). Parasites were recovered from the gut at necropsy. Non parametric statistics describe
     the spatial distribution patterns of foxes; discriminant analysis of the environmental
     variables is used to distinguish between positive stations (with at least one parasitized fox)
     and negative ones (no parasitized fox) in each department.</p>
    <p>In Haute-Savoie, the whole of foxes and the group of parasitized ones have rather similar
     spatial patterns, but not in Cantal. In discriminant analyses, temperature, especially maximal
     temperature, is the main discriminating variable. Positive and negative stations are
     significantly different in both departments, with 71% stations correctly classified in
     Haute-Savoie (5 positive and 22 negative misclassified stations among 92) and 91% in Cantal (1
     positive and 8 negative misclassified among 97). Negative stations may be undetected positive
     ones, and therefore are more often misclassified than positive stations.</p>

     The main aim of the investigations is to determine the part of North Eu- ropean migrants
     infected with the different groups of Haemosporidia aut- gide the nesting areas. The work was
     carried out on the level of separa- te populations of Fringilla coelebs, Phylloscopus
     trochilus, Hippolais icterina and Sylvia atricapilla in the Kurische Spit of the Baltic
     Sea.</p>
    <p>To solve the problem ornithology methods of bird banding as well as age and seasonal analyses
     of infection dynamics were used. The results of the carried out investigations testify that the
     northern Europe migrants are infected with Haemosporidia during the wintering and in migratory
     route. The birds became infected with Leucocytozoon more offen while mo- ving within the bounds
     of the west Palaearctic, and with Plasmodium and Haemoproteus - while wintering in the
     Ethiopian region. Migrations to- wards the Mediterranean zone and Ethiopian zoogeographical
     region are of unegual value from the point of view of infection of birds with Plasmo- dium,
     Haemoproteus and Leucocytozoon. The further spreading of Haemospo- ridia, brought from the
     South to the nesting areas of birds, was not re- gistered by us.</p>

    <p>During the period December 1988 to June 1989, children in three urban elementary schools as
     well as those in two rural ones îin Ogun State, Nigeria, were examined for intestinal
     parasitosis. Special emphasis was laid on hookworm infection, The formol-ether concentration
     technique was used to examine the parasites in the stool samples collected and for each
     specimen that was positive for hookworm, the number of hookworm egzs per gram (Epg) was
     determined. Of 312 six-year-old school children examined, 221 (6l4.6#) were infected with one
     or more parasite species.</p>
    <p>The parasites recovered include Ascaris lumbricoides 178 (52.14), Trichuris trichiura 121
     (35.44), hookworm 69 (20,2%) Stronyloides stercoralis L (1.24) Giardia intestinalis 1 (0.3#),
     Entamoeba histolytica 7 (2.0#) and E. coli 5 (2,3%). The prevalence of each of the helminths in
     the two rural schools was higher than that in each of the urban schools with the exception of
     that of 5, stercoralis. The protozoan parasites were negative in the rural schools. The
     intensity of hookworm eggs was found to range from 1,000 to 3,500 Epg. The larvae obtained
     after hatching some of the eggs and the adult worms recovered after treatment of some of those
     harbouring the infection with bephenium hydroxynaph- thoate (alcopar), were those of Necator

     Cryptosporidium sp. oocysts - HIV patients Cryptosporidium sp. have been recognized as a common
     cause of severe and sometimes fatal infection in immunodeficient people. To evaluate its
     frequency in AIDS, a parasitological survey for detection of oocysts in the faeces was carried
     out among 112 HIV-infected individuals.</p>
    <p>Direct and formol concentrated faecal smears stained by the auramine-phenol and by the
     modified Ziehl-Neelsen methods, were screened. Observation of non-stained material diagnosed a
     number of other protozoal agents. In the majority of cases, stools of three successive days
     were observed.</p>
    <p>Faecal samples revealed: Cryptosporidium sp. in 15 (13.4%), Isospora belli 5 (4.54%), Giardia
     lamblia 9 (8%), Entamoeba histolytica 3 (2.74%), Entamoeba coli 8 (7.14), Endolimax nana 14
     (12.5%), Iodamoeba butschlii 2 (1.8%) and Chilomastix mesnilli 1(0.9%) Co-infection of
     Cryptosporidium sp. with other organisms was recorded twice, one case with I. belli and another
     with G. lamblia and E. nana.</p>
    <p>Positive cases of cryptosporidium were seen in all risk groups of HIV-infection.</p>

     egg-output Analyses.of scat samples from montane and lowland troops of Chacma baboons, Papio
     ursinus, in Natal, South Africa, have revealed major differences in the diversity, prevalence
     and egg-output rates of gastro-intestinal helminths. Troops living at high altitudes (1000 -
     2750m) were frequently infected with six species and with high egg- output rates while those
     living in a sub-tropical environment on the coastal plain (altitude 100 - 200m) harboured
     twelve species but with much lighter infections. For example, in montane animals,
     Oesophagostomum bifurcum had a prevalence of 46.7 - 51.3% and egg-output rates of up to 1840
     eggs/g. On the lowlands this parasite infected only 15.2% of baboons and its egg-output was
     low, 0.26 - 2.53 eggs/g. The same trend was evident for Trichuris trichiura viz. 24.3 - B0.0%
     prevalence and 1.1 - 195.7 eggs/g in the montane habitat and 5.8% and 0.31 - 1.29 eggs/g in the
     lowlands. This situation, where parasite burdens and egg-output rates were higher in the cold,
     montane environment than in the warm, sub-tropical lowland one, contrasts with that found for
     human gastro- intestinal helminths and is believed to be related to the availability of food
     for the baboons and their nutritional status. This relationship is examined with respect to the
     nutritive value of food plants used by the different troops, the proportions of time spent
     foraging and the existence of a "nutritional bottleneck" for the animals at the montane site
     during the winter months.</p>

     in a calving cows grazing system in tropical area have been recorded for 2 years. Calvings of
     the 4 observed herds of calving cows were pooled during the dry season or the raïny season.
     Each herd grazed 3 paddocks of natural pasture according to a rotational system (14 days of
     grazing per paddock). For each paddocks at the entrance of animals, numbers of L3 on pasture
     were assessed aroynd pats (L3(AP)) and within 1 m radius from pats (L3(1RFP)). They were
     expressed as L3/kg dry matter and L3/m2. Sixty nine regressor variables were used : combination
     of variables 1inked to animals (weight, faecal eggs, stocking rate) and combination of
     ecological variables (rainfall, global radiation, herbage mass). L3(1RFP) were highly
     correlated to L3(AP) (r = 0.86 to 0.89). Multiple component analysis and hierarchical
     clustering procedure lead to 4 classes which were characterized by faecal eggs and stocking
     rate, but surprisingly, not by climatic conditions. Within these classes, a limit of global
     radiation acting between the 8th and the 14th day after the entrance of animals has been
     determined beyond this limit (19.7 MJ/m2/d), the numbers of L3 around pats decreased from 1.3
     to 27.1 times. Clustering factor and global radiation factor explained 50 to 57% of the
     variance of L3(AP) variables.</p>

     Australia Haemonc contortus, eradication, closantel In August 1984 a new program ("Wormkill")
     for control of parasitic helminths in grazing sheep was launched in the Northern Tablelands of
     New South Wales, Australia. The major target species were Haemonchus contortus,
     Trichostrongylus colubriformis and Ostertagia circumcincta.</p>
    <p>Control of H. contortus was achieved by three treatments with closantel at 12-weekly
     intervals from early spring, while other species were controlled with broad-spectrum
     anthelmintics administered at the same times. Before the widespread adoption of the Wormkill
     program, H. contortus had been regarded as the most important of the helminth parasites of
     sheep in the region, regularly causing deaths and reduced production. In an attempt to control
     this parasite, farmers had resorted to monthly treatments with benzimidazoles and levamisole,
     which resulted in a high prevalence of anthelmintic resistance in all nematode species.</p>
    <p>Detailed records of faecal egg counts and differential larval cultures are available for
     eight farms in the Armidale area at intervals of 3-4 months from 1984 to 1989. These records
     strongly suggest that H. contortus has been eradicated from these farms, à conclusion supported
     by the fact that withdrawal of all closantel treatment on four of the farms from August 1986
     and institution of quarantine measures has not led to reappearance of the parasite.</p>

     COPD, epidemiology Visceral Larva Migrans (VLM) is caused by the dog and cat ascarids Toxocara.
     Some phenomena occurring during VLM are also known to occur in COPD, i.e. eosinophilia,
     increased total IgE and airway affections. In literature at some occasions a relation was
     suggested between VLM and the occurrence of asthmatic disease, however, others denied such a
     relation.</p>
    <p>Over 800 children attending schools in The Hague and Rotterdam participated in the pro- ject.
     The protocol for the study included the collection of blood and the completion of a
     questionnaire. The blood was analyzed for the number of eosinophils, the presence of Toxocara
     antibodies, total IgE and IgE-anti house dust mite. The questionnaire asked for information
     about "risk" factors (pet animals, public playgrounds e.o.) and about health with emphasis on
     allergic and airway affections. The schools were selected from areas with different
     socio-economic situations. The serological findings between the two cities differed remarkably.
     Toxocara prevalence was higher in The Haque than in Rotterdam. In The Haque the seropositive
     children had a significant higher mean total IgE than the seronegative group. Also the relative
     numbers of children having IgE- anti house dust mite with confirmed COPD was significantly
     higher in the seropositive than in the seronegative group. These significant differences were
     not found between the seropositive and seronegative groups from Rotterdam origin. No relation
     was found between the ‘'supposed risk factors" and seroprevalence. The socio-economic situation
     is apparently of small impact on seroprevalence in the Dutch society.</p>

     an increase in numbers of HIV positives with a corresponding increase in cryptosporidiosis in
     1988 compared to 1987. Of the 245 cases examined 82 (33.5%) harboured nine species of enteric
     parasites: Cryptosporidium (46), hookworms (12), Entamoeba coli (12), Strongyloides Stercoralis
     (5), Schistosoma mansoni (5), Isospora belli (4) Ascaris lumbricoides (3), Hymenolepis nana
     (3), and Giardia intestinalis (2). There were either single or mixed infections.
     Cryptosporidium oocysts were chiefly seen in cases having diarrhoea of liquid consistency.</p>
    <p>A majority of these patients were adults between 20 and 40 years of age with no predilection
     for any sex in positive cases.</p>

    <p>Distribution of Strongyloides in Ghana This study undertaken to determine the impact of some
     ecological factors on the distribu- tion and prevalence of Strongyloides stercoralis in Ghana
     is based on data obtained from 387,573 stool examinations carried out in 24 hospitals
     throughout the country during the period, 1957-61. Mean prevalence varied from 1.94% + 0.35 SE
     to 6.38% + 1.95 SE (sig.</p>
    <p>diff., t = 4.4026 for 0.001&lt;p&lt;0.01) with comparable mean prevalences in the various
     reg- ions ranging from 3.05% Ÿ 0.56 SE to 4.45% + 0.35 SE. Prevalence grades were on the who-
     le evenly distributed although the highest prevalence grade was more common in rain for- est
     and semi deciduous forest areas. There was no relationship between prevalence and rate of
     urbanization (viz. prevalences of 3.59% + 0.52 SE, 3.84% + 0.41 SE and 3.66% *0.47 SE in areas
     with high, moderate and low urbanization rates respectively). There was no correlation between
     rainfall level and prevalence at different urbanization rates. Alth- ough the highest
     prevalence was recorded in areas where high and regular rainfall, dense vegetation and oxysol
     soil type coincide, it seems soil type is an important determinant; highest prevalence (viz.
     4.43% Ÿ 0.5 SE) being recorded in oxysols soils and the lowest (viz. 3.05% Ÿ 0.34 SE) in
     laterilic soils. Thus the highest prevalence of 4.24% + O.46SE was recorded in rain forest
     vegetation associated with oxysols soils and the lowest pre- valence of 2.58% Ÿ 0.27 SE was
     recorded in wooded savannah associated mainly with laterite.</p>
    <p>The closest correlations between rainfall and prevalence were observed in oxysols soils (r =
     +0.7632 for 0.01&lt;p&lt;0.02) and coastal scrub-grassland vegetation (r = +0.7561 for
     0.01&lt;p&lt;0.02). Apparently, too much rain water on mineral ions adversely affects para-
     site survival in sodium vleisol soils. None polarization of prevalence generally my be due to
     existence in all areas of minimal edaphic conditions for the parasite's free-living cycle.</p>

    <p>SIGNIFICANCE OF CRYPTOSPORIDIUM IN THE CAUSATION OF ACUTE DIARRHOEA AMONGST CHILDREN IN
     CALCUTTA P. Das, P. Chaudhuri, K. Sengupta, S.K. Sil and S.C. Pal National Institute of Cholera

    <p>Cryptosporidium, Acute Diarrhoea, Non-diarrhoeic, Paediatric, Kinyoun's acid fast stain.</p>
    <p>Cryptosporidium a protozoan parasite is a well known cause of diarrhoea in animals. Recent
     reports, however, indicate that this parasite may also cause self-limiting diarrhoea in
     immuno-competent human beings and life-threatening diarrhoea in immunocompromised patients.
     Information on the prevalence and clinical presentation of this infection in India is still
     meagre. In the present study, an attempt was made to assess the magnitude of the problem and
     the relative importance of Cryptosporidium as a casual agent of acute diarrhoea among
     paediatric patients in and around Calcutta.</p>
    <p>During a two year study, Cryptosporidium oocysts were detected from 32(5.6%) of 566
     hospitalized paediatric diarrhoea cases. From each stool sample at least two smears were
     stained. One was negatively stained by Giemsa and other was positively stained with modified
     Kinyoun's acid fast stain. The parasite could be identified from 1.2% of the 167 non-
     diarrhoeic individuals. Of the 32 positive cases, the parasite was detected as sole pathogen
     from 17(3.0%) cases and in combination with other established enteropathogen(s) in 15(2.6%)
     cases. The frequency of the parasite was higher in the 0-6 months age group. No sex specific
     incidence was discernible. The detection rate of the parasite was highest during the monsoon
     and post-monsoon months. Most of the patients had watery stools with mild to moderate degree of
     dehydration lasting for less than 7 days.</p>
    <p>It is apparent from this study that Cryptosporidium is a common parasite causing diarrhoea in
     the paediatric age group in Calcutta and it should routinely be sought in diarrhoea stool
     samnles.</p>

    <p>Capreolus capreolus - Natural infection - Gastrointestinal nematodes The contents of the
     abomasum, small intestine, colon and coecum of eleven roe- deer (Capreolus capreolus), captured
     in the spring of 1986 in different parts of the National Reserve in Riaño, situated in the
     Cordillera Cantäbrica (Leôn, N.W. Spain), were collec- ted separately. All the animals were
     males and their ages ranged from 1 to 6 years.</p>
    <p>In order to obtain the adult nematodes, the contents of each part of the intestinal tract
     were fittered through meshes placed in a column (1000-350-150 mp), and the deposit from the
     last two ones was collected. All the worms obtained were mounted on lactophenol cotton blue at
     0.005 %.</p>
    <p>All the roe- deer were infected by gastrointestinal nematodes. Nevertheless,the num ber of
     parasites varied considerably from animal to animal, ranging from 101 to 3460 (= 956 + 966.1
     s.e.). 100 % of the roe-deer presented adults in their abomasa and small intestines, while only
     90.9 % and 81.8 % of the colons and coeca were infected respecti- vely. The number of worms
     obtained from the different parts of the intestinal tract was: 4 —- 2467 (x= 471 + 725.5 s.e.)
     in the abomasum, 89 - 1253 (%= 466 + 373.4 s.e.) in the small intestine, 5 - 19 (X= 10 + 4.9
     s.e.) in the colon, and 3 - 25 (X= 9 + 8.1 s.e.) in the coecum.</p>
    <p>Trichostrongylus, Spiculopteragia, Ostertagia and Haemonchus were identified in the abomasum.
     The highest percentage (59.1%) corresponded to the first genus, and the lowest one (0.3 %) to
     the last one. Nematodirus (88.2 %) predominated in the small intestine, where also
     Trichostrongylus (10.2%) and Cooperia (1.6%) were found. 44.2 % of Capillaria 31.4 % of
     Oesophagostomum and 24.4 % of Trichuris were identified in the coecum, while only Capillaria
     was found in the colon.</p>

    <p>565 families with 0-6 age group were recruited, using a 50 % sampling rate and by simple
     randomization. The study had a descriptive design with partly analvtic approach. Family
     variables were collected by applying a questionnaire to house-wives and scotch-tape technique
     was used for the collection of specimens, from children, during home visits.</p>
    <p>Chi-square significance tests were used in analysing the data. The prevalance of enterobiasis
     was found to be 22.3 percent in 0-6 age group children. A significant correlation of 0.01 was
     ascertained between the prevalence of enterobiasis and factors such as family structure, family
     size, degree of malnutrition and anemia.</p>
    <p>The fact that infection is also uwuidespread when socio-economic and environmental variables

     of the prevalence of intestinal helminths, (2) reinfection studies to explore the impact of
     chemotherapy on ascariasis and (3) an investigation of predisposition to ascariasis. Intensity
     of infection was assessed indirectly by egg counts and also by counting worms passed after
     chemotherapy in the case of À. lumbricoides. Reinfection patterns of A. lumbricoides were
     assessed at two six- monthly intervans and statistical evidence for predisposition to heavy or
     light infection was obtained. À further investigation of three groups of children who were
     predisposed to be uninfected, lightly infected and heavily infected was undertaken. The
     objective was to compare à potential environmental influence on the observed predisposition
     with a likely genetic influence. The incidence of soil egg counts in the child's home environ-
     ment was used as an indicator of exposure and the distribution of HLA class 1 antigens amongst
     the children as an indicator of susceptibility. The socioeconomic status of the children was
     also evaluated. The three groups of children were found to differ in terms of both exposure and
     susceptibility-related factors.</p>

     of embryonated eggs of round- worm Toxocara. The eggs hatch in the stomach and the larvae
     migrate for many months throughout the tissues of the body and can cause inflammations. The
     diagnosis of toxo- cariasis rests mainly upon specific serological methods.</p>
    <p>The aim of this study was to determine the serological prevalence of Toxocara infection in
     the patients of both sexes and of various ages hospitalized in the Clinical Centre in
     Ljubljana, Yugoslavia. Arbitrarily taken sera of 334 patients with different clini- cal
     manifestations were tested with ELISA as described by van Knapen et al., using
     excretory/secretory (ES) antigen. Positive and negative reference sera were obtained from the
     National Institute of Public Health and Environmental Protection, Bilthoven, Netherlands. Among
     115 children aged 3 to 10 years we detected 10 (8.7 %) positive sera, among 65 patients aged 11
     to 20 years, 4 (6.2 %) were positive, among 75 patients aged 21 to 30 we detected 3 (4 %)

     city of Salamanca (Spain) and, and, patients attended at the University Hospital in Salamanca
     whose faeces were sent for study. Eleven day care centres and 7 primary schools were included
     in the survey. The day care centres and the primary schools were selected randomly. Two fecal
     samples were obtained from each child at an interval of 4 days. The number of children
     attending the day care centres studied was 113 and 107 in the first and second samplings,
     respectively (age range of 10-72 months, mean age + standard deviation: 31.9 + 26.7 months). In
     the primary schools the number of children was 67 in both samplings (age range 5-14 years). A
     clinico-epidemiological card was drawn up for each child, and included data on bouts of
     diarrhoea and/or abdominal pain. Additionally, during 1989, 1121 fecal samples from 854
     patients attending our hospital were studied.</p>
    <p>All fecal samples were studied by direct wet visualization and the Ritchie concentration
     technique. The finding of greater than 5 organisms per x 400 field was considered to be
     evaluable.</p>
    <p>The protozoan was found in 5.3% (6/113 children in the first sampling) and 10.3% (11/107
     children in the second sampling) of the children studied in the day care centres. Prevalence by
     ages was higher in the children older than 3 years of age (p&lt; 0.01 in the first sampling).
     In the primary schools, B.hominis was found with greater frequency: 19.4% (13/67 children in
     the first sampling) and 13.4% (9/67 children in the second sampling). Prevalence was higher in
     the 10-14 year old age group than in the 5-9 group. Both in day care centres and in primary
     schools, all cases were observed in asymptomatic children. In the group of patients attended at
     the Hospital, B.</p>
    <p>hominis was detected as the only enteropathogen in 2.57% (22 out of 854 patients) and 2.14%
     of the fecal samples (24 out of 1121 fecal samples).</p>
    <p>B.hominis is considered to be a protozoan that often colonizes the juvenile population
     attending day care centres and the primary schools in our community; its prevalence increases
     with age and it does not produce any noteworthy gastrointestinal symptoms. The presence of this
     parasite in the faeces sent for study from patients with symptoms compatible with intestinal
     parasitization in which any other enteropathogen can be ruled out suggests an etiology that
     should receive further attention in the future.</p>

     - Epidemiology - Children - Israel Of 3,079 children in a medium sized community near Jerusalem
     11.2% were found to be infested with living lice and eggs (Pediculus humanus capitis). Another
     23.4% had only nits. Boys and girls were equally infested. The incidence of infestation was
     highest among children aged 4 to 11. About 78% of the infested children had 1-10 lice. Approxi-
     mately 80% of the infested children had nits which were 2-5 cm away from the scalp. The
     incidence of children infested with lice averaged between 0 and 23.8% in 11 kinder- gartens and
     between 3.8% and 23.5% in 8 schools. Boys with medium length hair and girls with short hair
     showed the highest incidence of lice infestation. Children with brown and red hair were more
     infested that those with black and blond hair. Boys and girls with straight and wavy hair were
     more infested that those with curly and frizzy hair.</p>

     Belgrade, Yugoslavia Giardia lamblia, Prevalence, Schoolchilären In order to assess the present
     status of giardiasis in Serbia in compari- son with previous similar studies, a single stool
     sample was examined from 2621 asymptomtic schoolchilädren (aged 7-10 years) from seven regions
     of Serbia between 1983 and 1988. Giardia lamblia was detected in all examined regions with a
     prevalence of infection ranging from 3,6%(14/386) to 13,5% (40/297). The overall prevalence
     rate of Giardia was calculated at 7,4% (194/2621).The prevalence in children from urban areas
     of examined regions of Serbia (8,2%,111/1338) was higher than that from rural areas (6,4%,
     83/1283), although not significantly (X2 = 3,185, p &gt; 0.05). Comparison of the results of
     the present research with similar studies performed thirthy years ago showed the same level of
     prevalence with a slightly increasing trend. The results indicate that Giardia lamblia is
     endemic in Serbia and suggest the importance of person-to-person transmission of
     giardiasis.</p>

     (91,6%). Maximum in- fection (100%) is observed in August-September during ground feeding.</p>
    <p>In winter while animals feed on conifer seeds their infection is redu- ced to minimum. Five

     animals is higher (11,1% than that of adults (36,6%). In spring when marmots' activity becomes
     lower their infection with coccidiae does not exceed 36,6%. In summer it reaches 89,3% With
     emergence of green plants, especially perennials, marmot families graze in close contact which
     increases the possibility of their infection with coccidiae. E.ondatraezihe- thicae and
     E.uliange were found in 20 (44,4%) of Ondatra zibethica E.furonis and E.bagcanica - in 2

    <p>Nematodes, cattle, communal land, Zimbabwe Gastro-intestinal nematode infection of calves,
     heifers, steers, lactating and non lactating cows from communal land near Harare was studied
     over one year period. The climate of this area is characterised by a warm rainy season from
     November to April with 750 mm of rainfall, a cool dry period from May to August and a hot dry
     period from September to October/November.</p>
    <p>Faeces from identified animals was examined every month by Mc Master method. Infective larvae
     were identified after faecal culture at 25C for 10 days. The eggs per g of faeces (epg) varied
     according to the category of the animals and the season. Calves had the highest epq followed
     by, in decreasing order, lactating cows, heifers, non lactating cows and steers.</p>
    <p>The egg counts rose from November to reach the peak level in April. It was followed by a
     gradual decline to reach the lowest level between August and October. The high counts were
     correlated to the warm rainy season whereas the low counts were observed during the dry periods
     of the year. Larval differentiation showed the following genera Cooperia (50%), Haemonchus
     (28%), Oesophagostomum (12%), Trichostrongylus (8%), Strongy- loides (2%). The data indicate
     that the nematode infection in communal land cattle is higher than in the commercial farm
     cattle in the same area.</p>
    <p>This may be be attributed to high stocking rate, poor pastures, poor nutrition and lack of
     anthelmintic treatment. One of the reasons of poor performance of communal land cattle and
     death may be the gastro-intestinal nematode infections specially in young calves and lactating
     cows.</p>

     helminthiasis Socio-economic factors relating to prevalence of intestinal helminthic infections
     were studied in 189 adult volunteers residing in Bangkok. Questionaires were used to interview
     volunteer about their occupation(s), income(s), family occupation(s), family income(s) and
     their educational level(s). All volunteers were subjected to three stool microscopic
     examinations and to stool cultures for Strongyloides stercoralis. Out of 189 volunteers 34 were
     students (20%), 60 were unemployed (35%), and the remainder were employed in private or public
     sectors. The overall average incomes of the volunteers were low (less than USS 1,000 /yr)and
     56% of them came from middle class families (USS 2,000-4,000 /yr). Regarding the educational
     level, 14 volunteers (9%) did not complete primary school, 107 volunteers (77%) completed
     secondary school and 20 (13%) were university graduates. Prevalence of intestinal helminthic
     infection in the volunteers was 31.2% (59/189) and 29% (17/59) of infected individuals had
     multiple infections. The distribution among them was as follows: Strongyloidiasis 35.5%,
     Hookworm 20.3%, Giardiasis 18.6%, Opistorchiasis 13.6%, Amoebic Dysentery 10.2%, Trichuriasis
     3.4%, Teniaisis 1.7% and Ascariasis 1.7% There were no differences statistically in incomes,

    <p>The mussels are economically important both as a source of proteinrich food and the agents
     for pearl production.</p>
    <p>Various attempts are being made to develop the technique for mass culture of the mussels.</p>
    <p>In India, the freshwater mussels Lamellidens marginalis have drawn the attention of
     malacologists with a view to develop viable mussel industries. As mass rearing tech- nique
     requires knowledge on the pattern of life-cycle an attempt was made to note the ecology of the
     glochidian larvae of L. marginalis in relation to their fish-hosts oc- curring in West Bengal,
     India. It is revealed that the mussels L. marginalis discharge the glochidian larvae through
     the exhalent siphon, with the help of a mucoid thread, at an interval of 1.5 - 2.5 minutes. The
     process of discharging is continued for hours together. Coming in contact with the surrounding
     water the larvae were seen still for few minutes. After that rhythmic opening and closing of
     the valves was noticed. Such activities enabled the larvae to puncture the mucoid thread.
     Following this, they attacked the fish-host at earliest opportunity.</p>
    <p>Through thère exists a strong host-specificity it is apparent that the edible fish species
     are more susceptible to attack. The preference for particular host species and the possible
     reasons for such preference have been studied in relation to physico- chemical factors of the
     water body concerned, Sé.D 31 P.</p>

     University, Shillong 793 014, ndia Human lice, Ectoparasites Ectoparasitic infections among
     human population secure a world wide importance, particularly in underdeveloped and developing
     countries in the tropics. Among ectoparasites, lice infesta- tion, especially among the
     socio-economically poor section of the society, is a major problem in India. The present
     communication purports to determine the prevalence of lice among different sex and ages of two
     socio-economically distinct groups of human population sharing the same climate in Shillong, a
     high rainfall area in Meghalaya, North-East India. In a total of 536 poor and 437 middle-class
     individuals, the overall prevalence of lice was found to be 59.7 and 15.79%, respectively. The
     rate of infection was significantly higher (73.28) among the former, particularly in the age
     group 11-20 years. ‘ Pediculus humanus humanus emerged as the most predominant louse species,
     followed by P. h. capitis. Pthirus pubis was .the least prevalent species among the two groups
     of people examined. P. h. humanus was more prevalent in the age group 11-20 years.</p>
    <p>P. h. capitis showed its higher prevalence in the age group above 20 years of the poor
     section, while in the other section, the age group 11-20 years was more frequently parasitized.
     Both P. h. capitis and P. pubis showed a higher rate of prevalence among the male
     individuals.</p>
    <p>Poorly hygienic and over-crowded living conditions greatly influence the transmission and
     perpetüation of these insect parasites in the studv area.</p>

     hâematological and biochemical methods A total of 3067 subjects were randomly selected and
     examined for parasites infec- tion . Parasitological examination of stool and egg count were
     carried out by formol- ether concentration and Stoll's technique, respectively The prevalence
     of Trichuris trichiura was 36.1% , Ascaris lumbricoides 19.8%,hook- worm 14.2% , Strongyloides
     stercoralis 10.6% , Hymenolepis nana 3.5% , and Trichostron- gylus spp. 3.1% of the population
     under study. Mean egg counts of Trichuris infection was 977 with the range 100 - 24600 egg per
     gram of faeces Average intensity of Trichuris was highest in the under 10 years old age
     group.The iron status of 120 patients with pure Trichuris trichiura infection and 54 controls
     were studied for serum iron, percent transferrin saturation, haemoglobin and other
     haematological indices. Anaemia based on the haemoglobin level of less than 13 g/dl for males
     and 12 g/dl for females was found in 10 (8%) of the patients. Among the re- maining 110
     non-anaemic patients 11% would be classified as iron deficient by serum iron measurement and 6%
     by percent transferrin saturation.</p>
    <p>These finding suggest that serum iron and percent transferrin saturation is a valid and
     sensitive test for determinig iron deficiency in these patients, so that trichuris trichiura

     tracer calves The seasonal population trends of cattle nematodes in tracer calves are described
     from 1981 to 1987. Successive worm-free calves were grazed with growing beef cattles for 20-30
     days at 6 weeks intervals and then slaughtered for nematodes counts 2 weeks after their removal
     from pasture. Ostertagia, Cooperia, Trichostrongylus and Haemonchus were the main genera
     recovered. O0. ostertagi was the most often found and acquisition of inhibition-prone larvae
     begins äïin late winter and peak numbers are acquired in spring. While maximum larvae
     availabi]lity was in autumn. The seasonal inhibition and larval availability pattern for T.
     axei was similar to that of Ostertagia. Cooperia showed negligible inhibition during mid-winter
     to early spring and reached maximum larvae levels in autumn and spring.</p>
    <p>Haemonchus was more prevalent during summer to early autumn and no inhibition was observed.
     It could be concluded that the infective larvae availability for tracer calves was highest
     during autumn, and most reduced in summer. And all predominant species were able to survive
     over summer in pastures.</p>

    <p>Amebic colitis, Amebic liver abscess, Male homosexual, Sexually transmitted amebiasis The
     spread of sexually transmitted amebiasis among male homosexuals is à serious prob- lems in
     advanced countries. In Japan, a similar trend is now suspected by reson of the currently
     increasing of amebiasis in large cities. The cases reported to the Japanese Ministry of Health
     and Welfare nave markedly increased since the beginning of 1980s.</p>
    <p>We diagnosed 71 men and three women with amebiasis during the past 10 years in our
     laboratory. The cases are including 34 amebic colitis, 24 amebic liver abscess, 11 colitis and
     liver abscess and 5 other formes of amebiasis. Mean period from the onset of clinical symptoms
     to the confirmation of diagnosis of amebic colitis was 10.7 months.</p>
    <p>Such a longer period needed to confirm the diagnosis was mainly due to their milder clinical
     signs and symptoms. In regard to amebic liver abscess, most cases were correctly diagnosed
     within one month after the onset of their clinical symptoms.</p>
    <p>Serum antibody to E. histolytica by gel precipitation test was positive in 100% of amebic
     liver abscess and in 87% of amebic colitis. It was of interest that more than 60% of the amebic
     liver abscess cases showed no previous or simultaneous intestinal amebiasis.</p>
    <p>Out of the 74 amebiasis, 60% of the patients had never been abroad and 40% of the patients
     were seropositive for syphilis. Seven of the 18 patients with amebiasis diagnosed during two
     recent years were male homosexuals.</p>
    <p>These findings strongly suggest that considerable number of amebiasis are sexually
     transmitted among male homosexuals in Japan.</p>

     Schistosomiasis,Socioeconomic,Epidemiology In this paper we have discussed the relationship
     between the schistosomiasis transmis- sion and some socioeconomic factors, observed in the
     epidemic areas of a fishfarm of suburb of Wuhan city, China. 446 households and 1762
     individuals were investigated by sociological methods. It was found that the 73 households and
     157 persons were infeoted with Schistosoma japonicum. The 26 factors from the social, cultura
     and economic survey are listed in table. The statistical analysis revealed a signficant
     relevence to the some societal factors(member of family, enducation head of household, distance
     between house and snail habitats), and a few associotion with personal economical income. It is
     not surprising that the most influential factor in the transmission of schistosomiasis emerging
     from this study was cultural level of individuals. There is reason to believe that the cultured
     persons have more knowledge about schistosomiasis and stay away from contaminated water more
     ofter. Therefore, a antischistosomiasis project, carried out in a lake-marsh area, must include
     develeping the education and raising the cultural level of population.</p>

     Organization forScience and Technology,IRAN Diptera, Myiasis, War, IRAN The occurrence of
     Myiasis among the injured soldiers of The First and The Second World-War has already been
     reported from Europe. The frequent wars of the Middle East during the past several decades,
     which were strategically short-term, did not provide sufficient opportunity for the study of
     Myiasis. However, favorable climatic conditions and long lasting Iraq-lran war stimulated an
     outbreak of wide range of flies causing Myiasis among the Iranian casulties.</p>
    <p>Larval samples were collected from injured combatants in the operat- ing rooms of different
     hospitals and from the corps of dead-ones, which were transferred to an special morgue (Meraj
     Shohada) at the Medical Le- gal Center in Tehran. These Martyrs were fallen to the ground and
     ex - posed to flies in the battle-field only a few hours. The elapsed time till they reached to
     Tehran was only 4 to 6 days.</p>
    <p>Most of the larvae were in the last stage of their development when collected. Out of each
     batch of larvae, some were used for morphologi- cal studies and the others were allowed to

     Italy Ascaris suum - Pig - Epidemiology - Italy The prevalence of Ascaris suum infection in 106
     pig intensive breedings in Northern Italy was studied in relation to the different categories
     of animals (pregnant saws, lactating saws, piglets and fattening pigs) and to the different
     breeding systems. An overall pre- valence of 71% for gastro-intestinal nematodes infection was
     found. 24% of breedings were: positive for A. suum, 48% for Trichostrongylid worms and 30% for
     Tricuris suis. A. suum showed the highest prevalences in pregnant sows, but high prevalences
     were also found in fattening pigs (9-10%). The highest values in fecal eggs counts were
     obtained in fatte- ning pigs in which counts higher than 2,000 eggs per gram (max 8,000) were
     not so infre- quent. Moreover, the examination of fecal residues in pens showed a very high
     spread of infectious eggs in the habitat. No significant differences were fuond in fecal exami-
     nation between pens with solid floor (53%) or with grating floor (27-32%). The differen- ce in
     À. suum prevalence observed between copromicroscopical (9%) and post motrem exami- nation
     overall prevalence (16,3%) in fattening pigs suggest the use of fecal residues in pens as a
     more reliable diagnosis of the infection in the herd. Besides, the results emphasize the
     presence of the parasitic form in the habitat and suggest that it might be the most important
     factor in perpetuating A. suum infection in the intensive breeding system.</p>

     Dictyocaulus viviparus - calves - epidemiology In order to study the availability of
     Dictyocaulus viviparus in the pasture, an epidemiological study was conducted over a 3-year
     period (January 1987-December 1989). During the 36 month period a pair of tracer calves (4
     month old) and one permanent calf were killed at montly intervals for analysis of lungworm
     population in relation to seasonal factors and management condictions. Results showed that the
     climate variations of Paraïfba's Valley allowed the development and survival of larvae during
     almost all the year. During the winter period, June-July-August ,when there is the greatest
     number of available larvae on the pasture, the outbreak of the disease was observed in the
     tracer animals. Low temperature was the factor best correlated. The larvae acquire during the
     summer and autumn by the permanent calves induced an immune resposte in these animals which did
     not show either worm burdens at necropsy nor larvae in faeces since July.</p>

     During a year (June 1988-June 1989), two major regions in fehran,one in north and the other in
     south were examined for intestinal parasites. The flutation and wet mount (with saline and
     logol dye)techniques were the procedures with the specimens examined.</p>
    <p>The total specimens were 16007 which 3305 belongs to north of Tehran and 12702 to south.
     Besides, few specimens of the two regions belong to the suburb.</p>
    <p>In this study, the prevalence of infection in northern region for protozoa was 54.3% and for
     helminths was 8% in southern region, for protozoa was 66.4% and for helminths was 9.9%. A
     multiple infection to protozoa and metazoa were 0.26% in northern region and 2.9% in southern
     region of Tehran.</p>
    <p>The prevalence of intestinal parasites in northern region were as follows, respectively:
     Giardia 36.2% , Ascaris 4.9%, Himenolepisnana and Trichomona hominis 2% and in southern region,
     Giardia 57.4% oxyure 5.5%, Himenolepisnana 2.5% and Entamoba histolytica 1.6%.</p>
    <p>Taking account of fungi, fat cells, undigested food, charcotlyden crystals and W.B.C &amp;

     of Alto-Douro. The prevalence rate of canine leishmaniasis was studied in 712 animals by
     indirect immunofluorescence test complemented by counter-immuno-electrophoresis,
     parasitological and clinical examination. The prevalence rate found in 1986 was 10% and
     1987/88, 13.5%. However, in the last series was not included 4 negative villages from the first
     study. In the "Hot land" (schist valleys area) the prevalence rate was 24,8%. In the "Cold

     amount of 60 (min. 8, max. 175) ticks were collected. They turned out to be infected up to 20 %

     each characterized by mixed forest, moors and swampy components.</p>
    <p>Ticks of other biotops were not infected. Furthermore à high variety of species of wild and

    <p>Trichinosis human epidemiology Helminthosis in Lithuanian is a problem of today. Centres of
     trichino- sis and the number of people whu are ill with the infection cause espe- cially great
     anxiety. In the epidemiology of trichinosis in Lithuania boar and pork are of greatest
     importance because people use the meat for food. In a decade (1978-1987) trichinosis was
     registered in 7 towns and 36 (out of 44) administrational regions. 180 centres of human trichi-
     nosis were ascertained. Compairing the data of two five-year periods we find that in 1983-1987
     the number of centres grep up twice. Pork gave 29,4 i 3,4 % and boar 23,8 us 3,2 % of the
     centres. Human trichinosis is found in Winter more often than in spring and autumn. Sick rate
     for 10.000 of inhabitant during the latter five-year period was 0,4. Sanitary educa- tion for
     our inhabitans presently has improved particularly. That is the most important preventives for

     we have examined 444 dogs by visiting farms and peripheral districts in the above mentioned
     area (303 in S. Giovanni Rotondo, 111 in S. Marco in Lamis and 30 in Rignano). Clinical
     examination and immunofluo- rescence antibody test (IFA) for leishmaniasis were performed. Bone
     marrowe and lymph no- de samples obtained from the 25 dogs with positive serological test were
     microscopically examined and cultured on Tobie-Evans medium. Tha results obtained show a high
     seroposi- vity rate for canine leishmaniasis(12,2% in S.Giovanni Rotondo, 22,5 in S.Marco in
     Lamis and 6,7 in Rignano) and a high percentage of asymptomatic dogs with positive serological
     test (53,1%). Seven strains isolated from infected dogs belong to Leishmania infantum species

     studied previously. Both areas have similar ecological conditions. The seroepi demiological
     survey include the statistical prevalences comparison and the distribution of the positive
     cases in groups of age and sex.</p>
    <p>The survey on Gozo was carried out in two different villages: Qala, where 118 dogs were
     examined (71% of the estimated canine population) an Zebbug with 66 dogs (43%). On the East
     coast of Spain, 120 dogs were examined in Valencia (0,15% of the total canine popu lation) and
     79 in Alicante (0,2%).</p>
    <p>An ELISA methods using monoclonal antibodies was performed to detect circulating adult

    <p>Heartworm infection in dogs has been showed in Gozo for the first time. No statistical
     difference in the prevalence was found between Qala (8,4%) and Zebbug (7,5%), therefore the
     prevalence on the island of Gozo was 8%. The prevalences obtained on the East coast of Spain
     were 10% in Valencia and 13% in Alicante, no sifnificant difference was found again, the
     prevalence was 12% in this area of Spanish Levante.</p>

     transmission were studied in the county of Pedro de Toledo, Sao Paulo State, Brazil, during the
     years 1987/1988. The faeces of 4719 individuals were examined by Kato-Katz method, and the
     general prevalence rate was 4,8% being higher in males (6.2%) and also in the rural zone (5.8%)
     and in the children (5.3%). The geometric mean of S. mansoni was 35.1 eggs per gramme of
     stool;80% of the cases presented less than 100 eggs per gramme of faeces and only 20 persons
     were responsable for half eliminated eggs. The highest index of potential contamination were
     noted in the age group 5 to 20 years old (57.6%). The geographical distribution demonstred that
     cases did not show random pattern; the B. tenagophila snails and human water contact places
     were strongly associated. The case-control study in 96 pairs was done in autochthonous cases.
     Logistic Regression analysis showed the following odds ratio: to have water contact during
     swimming, playing, fishing and fordding; bad hygiene conditions. The main conclusions were: the
     infection rate was low; the youngsters were the scoup responsable for the transmission and they
     must be target in the prophylaxis; the transmission was focal; the water contacts through
     recreation represented the most important odds ratio; the knowledge, attitude and practices
     were satisfactory, but should be more developed.</p>

    <p>Control of Schistosomiasis, when global prevalence has been pulled down, shows residual
     persistent focuses in confined, unchanging space and during a very short and seasoned period.
     Snail population dynamic and wa- ter contact pattern are then necessary.</p>
    <p>The authors present 3 examples of focuses where they surveyed human preva- lence, snail
     population dynamic, cercarien emissions and chetotaxy.</p>
    <p>In Brazil, in 2 hamlets : (Maranhao state), despite 8 years of control and survey, the whole
     positive cases are people dwelling less than 200 meters around the infested water collections;
     every annual control gives the same data. In Cameroon, a little stream and a pool, 60 km apart,
     located in wet equatorial area, offer the following differences : in the stream popula- tion
     polluts only one site at the end of little rainy season, in April, cercarian emissions occur in
     the same place during the following 3 months.</p>
    <p>Latter the big rains carry snails away. Every year transmission occurs only in May, June,
     July. In the pool, swimming and fishing are limited to 2 points where we can pick up
     B.pfeifferi only during big dry season (we count up to 70% of infested snails every January)
     out of this period snails disappear. In other respects human prevalence becomes lower as
     dwellings are further from these 2 points.</p>
    <p>This information allows the adoption of control : what targeted population to treat, at what
     time to treat them and at what time to eventually local molluscicide.</p>

    <p>B.Di Sacco, L.Formaggini, C.Genchi Istituto di Patologia Generale Veterinaria Via Celoria 10,
     20133 MILANO, ITALY Dirofilaria immitis, cat, prevalence, Italy Heartworm infection is a
     mosquito born disease of domestic and wild carnivores spread in temperate areas over the world.
     In Italy, previous studies in dogs have demonstrated a very high prevalence of heartworm
     infection, mainly in the Northern regions along the course of the Po River. In these areas the
     average prevalence was found to be 40%, but prevalences more than 70% were not so infrequent.
     Moreover, in very heavy urbanized areas, like the toun of Milan, a prevalence of 7% was found
     in dogs kept in houses.</p>
    <p>The cat is knoun as a possible host of Dirofilaria immitis, even though the presence of the
     parasite in this species seems to be rather sporadic. Besides, in most cases in cats the
     microfilaremia is absent or at best transient, making the in vivo diagnosis very dif- ficult.
     However, the great number of both domestic and pound cats living in heavy heart- worm endemic
     areas in Italy should make possible the infection in cats.</p>
    <p>In the present survey, 84 domestic cats from a heavy endemic area for dogs (60%) were
     examined after necropsy. Most examined cats were older than 10 years old, of both sexes and
     different breeds. 12 cats were found to be infected with a minimum of 1 adult worm and a
     maximum of 5 (2 females and 3 males). Most worms were found in the right heart, but in 2 cats
     the worms were localized only in the pulmonary artery. Microfilarie were not found either in
     the utera of adult females or in the blood of the cats. This data seems to indicate the
     heaviest prevalence ever reported in cats (14.28%).</p>

    <p>Dirofilaria immitis, heartworm, epidemiology, seasonal transmission Although general
     assumptions exist regarding the regional transmission of Dirofilaria immitis in the USA, little
     controlled data is available to verify or refute these claims. Parallel to field studies in GA,
     FL, and LA in which a new heartworm adulticide (RM 340) was evaluated, 3 groups of 5 "Tracer"
     beagles at each site were exposed to potential infection during 3 consecu-tive, 4-month
     periods, respectively; an additional group of 5 dogs exposed for 12 months was included.
     Exposure for the 12- month group and the first set of "Tracer" dogs was initiated in April
     1988. After exposure, all dogs were held indoors for 5 months. Transmission occurred at all of
     the 3 sites during the periods of April to August and August to December, but no trans- mission
     was evident at any of the 3 sites during the period of December to April.</p>
    <p>Based on worm measurements and microfilaremia data, most of the transmission occurred late in
     the April-August period and early in the August-December period in all of the 3 sites. Heavier
     worm burdens in LA, compared with those in GA and FL, indicated a higher level of transmission
     at this site. Worm recoveries in the dogs exposed for 12 months reflected the cumulative
     transmission in "Tracer" dogs: In LA, 4 of the 5 dogs had worms, with a group average of 25.2
     (range, 0-45); in GA, 4 of the 4 dogs had worms, with an average of 6.75 worms (range, 5-8);
     and in FL, 5 of the 5 dogs had worms, with an average of 5.4 worms (range, 1-13). Follow-up
     studies to confirm this unexpected and surprising lack of transmission from December to April
     are underway.</p>

     kala-azar in Iran have been increasing during the last decade,mainly due to application of
     specific serological tests,particularly IFAT,in diagnosis and serological surveys of the
     disease in à few centers.</p>
    <p>Visceral leishmaniasis(VL)is in an endemic form in some areas of Fars and East Azerbai- jan
     (E-Az).In other provinces sporadic cases have been found so far.The most affected age groups
     are children up to 8 years.The peak of percentages of number of the patients were 50% in the
     ages of 1-2 years in the endemic focus of E-Az and 30% in the ages of 3-4 years in sporadic
     cases.The rates of males in these two groups of the patients were 59.1% and 64.1%
     respectively.However,in sero-epidemiological studies of VL in the endemic focus of E.Az
     ,sero-positive rate (SPR) in females was,significantly,higher than males.Thus, the females are
     affected at least as much as males,but ,it seems that,there are more asymptomatic cases among
     females.</p>
    <p>In IFA serological surveys of VL in Meshkin-Shahr area,E.Az ,in 2785 residents of six
     selected villages SPR was totally 7.8% in titers of 1:80 to 1:640. IFAT in about 300 treated
     kala-azar patients who were tested once during 2 weeks up to six years after treatment showed
     generally slow decreasing of antibody titers. À considerable number of the patients were
     remained sero-positive in rather high titres, more or less for a long time after treatment.</p>
    <p>Dogs as well as Jackals and foxes have been found infected with Leishmania in Iran.lt seems
     that dogs are the main sources of infection for human VL in the endemic focus of E_Az.

     Clinical and seroepidemiological studies were performed in different groups of in- dividuals
     from rural and urban areas of Colombia and in pigs from the same areas. Sur- veys, clinical
     studies, descriptive studies, case and control studies, and quantitation of specific antibodies
     against antigens of T. solium larvae by enzyme-linked immuno- sorbent assay (ELISA) were the
     methods used in the present study.</p>
    <p>In areas of Colombia endemic for cysticercosis (n=3200) it was found that the in- adequate
     maintenance of pigs is associated with high levels of specific antibodies in hu- mans and pigs
     (p€0.05). The habit of eating undercooked pork was significantly associ- ated with a high
     frequency of convulsions (6%) and expulsion of proglottids of Taenia (7.54). The following were
     identified as risk factors for human neurocysticercosis: maintenance of pigs, inadequate
     maintenance conditions of the pigs, consumption of under- cooked pork, and taeniasis. In
     epileptic patients from an endemic area (n=300), the seropositivity was 30%. 2.5% of the
     patients of a regional center for the control of epilepsy were seropositive (n=350), while 5%
     of the patients interned in the regional mental hospital were seropositive (n=330). These
     findings were correlated with positive CAT scans, which demonstrates the importance of an
     immunological diagnosis in these groups of patients.</p>
    <p>The presence of specific antibodies in pigs sacrificed in various slaughterhouses from rural

    <p>THE ECONOMIC SIGNIFICANCE OF IXODES RUBICUNDUS, THE KAROO PARALYSIS TICK, IN SOUTH AFRICA
     L.J.Fourie, T.N. Petney, Department of Zoology-Entomology, University of the Orange Free State,
     Bloemfontein 9300, South Africa Paralysis tick Economic significance The purpose of this study
     was to evaluate I. rubicundus as an agricultural pest. Data was obtained from field studies on
     the epidemiology of Karoo paralysis using domestic and wild ungulate hosts as well as from
     regional surveys on host mortality.</p>
    <p>I. rubicundus is confined to hilly areas in the Karoo region of South Africa. A neuro-toxin
     is secreted by female ticks causing a flaccid paralysis and ultimate death of certain ungulate
     hosts. Natural hosts of the adults are Mountain Reedbuck which rarely suffer paralysis.
     Domestic sheep, goats and cattle, however, may experience a high (up to 65%) degree of
     mortality if allowed to graze in areas occupied by I.rubicun- dus. With the introduction of
     game farming wild ungulates have been introduced into areas occupied by the tick. Up to 50% of
     sub-adult Gemsbok and up to 207 of a Springbok population have been recorded as dying from
     paralysis.</p>
    <p>The hilly areas occupied by I. rubicundus provide the only natural shelter in the Karoo area
     and provide better forage than the grassy flats where the tick does not occur.</p>
    <p>Farmers should therefore exclude domestic stock from the better grazing areas during the
     active period (April-August) of adult ticks. Host productivity is probably reduced by confining
     stock to less suitable areas during winter months which may lead to overgrazing and concomitant
     veld deteriation in flat areas not occupied by the tick. The introduction of wild ungulate
     species into new distribution areas should also not be done until a full assessment of possible
     harmful parasite-host interactions has been made.</p>

     Cagliari,Via della Pineta,77, 09125 Cagliari - Italy Hydatid disease - Epidemiology - Sardinia
     In Sardinia hydatid disease, caused by Echinococcus granulosus is endemic. Hydatidosis is a
     disease of major economic and medical significance; at present time, a regional eradication
     campaign it has been carried out. Based on the first surgical cases the results of an
     epidemiological study over an 11-year period (1974-1984) are re- ported. For the 1679
     operations recorded, the annual average incidence was 9.57%o00 in habitans in the entire
     Island. The incidence of the disease in the rural areas was about twice that in towns. Males
     appear to be slight more exposed to the disease than females. 60% of operations involved the
     liver and liver involvement increased with the age of patients. An hypotesis on the increasing
     pattern of liver involvement with respect to lung infection is discussed. The true prevalence
     of hydatid disease in the population is underestimated by hospital admissions, data dramn from
     anatomical theatre records (autopsies) should indicate a incidence ranging likely between 1,200
     and 2,200/100,000 inhabitants (P &lt; 0.05). Since hydatidosis is strictly related to livestock
     Ît is necessary to enlarge the view of the problem. The incidence for sheep hydatidosis is one
     of the highest in the world (85%), but about 75% of the sheep har- boured only sterile cysts.
     The latest data suggests an interesting epidemiological question: the present potential
     infectivity to man and livestock of E. granulosus.</p>

     Epidemiology- Anopheles- Transmission An epidemiological study on malaria was conducted in a
     demographically defined population of 3625 individuals resident in 7 contiguous villages in
     Kataragama, a P.vivax malaria endemic region in southern Sri Lanka. The malaria incidence in
     this population, with respect to each individual resident and each household was monitored
     through à period of 17 months from November 1986. This informtion was analysed to ascertain if
     malaria was homogeneously distributed in the population of if it was “clustered" in households
     and individuals. The malaria incidence per house-group (the lowest number of adjacent houses
     which comprised 10 individuals) (case index) during 7 months of monitoring did not conform to a
     Poisson distribution; more house-groups had very low or very high case indices than could be
     expected from a Poisson distribution, indicating that malaria was clustered in houses. By a
     similar analysis based on the average number of malaria infections per person, malaria was also
     found to be clustered in individuals. The P,vivax infectious reservoir in this population was
     studied by directly feeding Anopheles tessellatus mosquitoes from a laboratory bred colony on a
     sample of 282 vivax malaria patients. Among 5 age groups of patients considered 0-, 5-, 15-,
     25- and 50+ years, the highest infectivity to mosquitoes was in the 15- year age group, the 0-
     year age group being the least infectious. Taking into consideration the incidence rate of
     P,vivax in each age group, the 15- year age group was found to contribute the most to the
     infectious reservoir. 25- and 5- age groups Contributed almost equally and constituted the

    <p>Malaria, French Guyana, prevalence, vector Since 1976, the number of cases of malaria in
     French Guyana has been increasing and reached 3269 in 1987, giving and incidence of 37.6 in
     1000. Our study shows that 75% of the cases occurs in the two regions which represent only 6.3%
     of the total population: along the Oyapock river on the Brasilian border with a malaria
     prevalence of 25%, and along the Maroni river on the Surinam border, with a prevalence of 2.3%.
     Most of the remaining cases are distributed along the coast, inhabited mainly by Haitian and
     Brazi- lian immigrants. In Cayenne, where 50% of the population lives, no cases have been
     observed. P. falciparum is responsible for 80% of the cases ; P. vivax accounts for the
     remaining cases but is remarkably absent on the lower: Maroni where individuals of African
     origin live. Age prevalence studies show that morbidity decreases with age indicating the
     existence of an acquiredpremunition. However, overall mortality remains very low, reflecting
     the efficacy of the numerous health care centers. The survey also confirms that Anopheles
     darlingi is probably the only vector of malaria in French Guyana.</p>
    <p>Other species of anopheles are found but their distribution is too limited (An. brazi-
     liensis) or their longevity too short (An. aquasalis) to be increminated in malaria
     transmission. Finally, the study analysed the various factors contributing to the resur- gence
     of malaria in this part of South America. The difficulty to establish ar effica- cious
     anti-vectorial campaign, for example the homeowners refusal of house spraying, is one of the
     most important factors that should be taken into account to improve malaria control in French
     Guyana.</p>

    <p>La surveillance de l'Hydatidose en France par le Centre National de Référence pour les

     parasitologie mis en place à la suite d'une enquête sérologique qui a permis d'estimer à 1300
     le nombre de sérologies positives pour les années 83 et 84. Le recueil prospectif des cas
     d'Hydatidose de 1985 à 1987 devait permettre de connaitre les caractéristiques épidémiologiques
     et cliniques afin de proposer des moyens de lutte et de prévention vis à vis des groupesà
     risque. 65% des cas surviennent chez des sujets de 20 à 60 ans avec un pic pour les sujets de
     50-60 ans (22% au total). Depuis 1985 la prévalence recule (environ 700 cas en 85, 500 cas en
     87). L'incidence annuelle a baissé de 14% entre 1986 et 1987. Tandis que la proportion des cas
     diagnostiqués en lle de France diminue (26% en 85, 17% en 87), celle des cas diagnostiqués en
     Provence- Alpes-Côte d'Azur reste la plus importante et se stabilise autour de 40% du total,
     témoignant de l'existence de foyers autochtones actifs dans cette région. Cependant l'essentiel
     des hydatidoses sont des cas importés des pays du Maghreb (50 à 60%), même si le nombre des
     hydatidoses d'importation baisse en 1987, alors que les cas autochtones ont progressé de 79 (en
     86) à 96 (en 87). La moitié de ces cas proviennent du Sud-Est et 26% de Corse. L'atteinte
     hépatique est la plus fréquente (70%) elle est souvent isolée (93%) et se voit au cours des

     d'environ 400 cas, est loin d'être un fléau social, cependant la lourdeur de cette affection,
     et l'existence de foyers autochtones persistants doivent inciter à connaitre les facteurs de

     Epidemiology of urinary schistosomiasis - Indirect methods In northern Nigeria where urinary
     infection of Schistosoma haematobium was found to be 11.7 percent - 46 percent with less than
     50 eggs per 10 ml of urine and of S.mansoni was 2 percent in 1098 primary school children from
     seven schools in three Local Government Areas (LGA): Biu, Gwoza and Askira-Uba of Borno
     state.</p>
    <p>Only 12.2 percent urine samples positive for proteinuria showed ova of S.haematobium
     indicating the existance of non-specific proteinuria in the area.</p>
    <p>High positive rate of 81.4 percent of S.haematobium eggs was recorded in children passing
     blood in urine.</p>
    <p>History of blood in urine (7.6%) in children closely agreed with the results of microscopy
     (7.1%) in children from Biu LGA only where tribal language spoken was Bura.lnvestigations
     revealed that the tribal languages : Waha and Margi spoken in the other two LGA failed to
     communicate the sense of the question on passing of blood in urine.</p>
    <p>The results of this study showed that the demonstration of blood in urine is the only
     reliable indirect method for the study of the epidemiology of urinary schistosomiasis in
     northern Nigeria.</p>

    <p>Les analyses parasitologique et sérologique ont porté sur un échantillon de 331 sujets âgés
     de 6 à 24 mois appartenant aux entreprises agraires et au secteur tradi- tionnel. Une enquête
     sur le vecteur et la situation du contrôle antivectoriel a été menée conjointement. Les

     B.decoloratus. La prévalence de B.</p>
    <p>bigemina varie de O à 100 % et le taux d'inoculation de 0,0002 à 0,111. L'analyse
     épidémiologique des données montre que la province de Huambo et la plus grande partie de la
     province de Huila sont des régions endémiques. Le contrôle inadéquate du vecteur et les
     conditions climatiques défavorables à son développement sont des facteurs responsables de
     situations d'instabilité endémique qui parfois se présen- tent. La région limitrophe entre les
     provinces de Huila et Cunene, ia grande partie de cette dernière et une partie de celle de
     Namibe sont considérées comme régions marginales. Dans le reste des deux dernières provinces la
     maladie est minimale, parfois même inexistente. La transhumance pratiquée dans ces régions est
     un facteur susceptible d'influencer l'épidémiologie de la maladie.</p>

    <p>BILATERAL ASYMMETRY OF DIPLOSTOMUM INFECTIONS IN [HE EYE LENS OF FISH T. Graczyk. W.Stefañski
     Institute of Parasitology, Polish Academy of Sciences, Pasteura 3, P.B. 153, 00-973 Warsaw,
     Poland Diplostomum metacercariae - bilateral asymmetry The bilateral asymmetry of Diplostomum
     metacercarial accumulation would tend to increase the danger of severe damage to one of the eye
     lens and minimize damage in the other. The lenses of 150 experimentally, and 270 naturally
     infected fishes were examined separately and the number of Diplostomum metacercariae in each
     lens was recorded. The individual chi-square values show from 3.3 % to 33.3 % of the fish
     sample depar- ted significantly from 1:1 ratio of parasites between the eye lenses, The
     statistics /Students "t" test, Chi-square test, Pearson correlation coefficient, Wilcoxon
     matched pairs and the s°/x ratio/ show that the metacercarial distribution is not a product of
     chance. The results of experiments suggest that bilateral asymmetry of metacercarial accumula-
     tion may be generated by one or all of the following factors: high in- tensity of infections,
     small size of fishes, long and harassing cerca- rial migration through the host tissues to the
     lenses.</p>

     mosquito {the only vector of Wuchereria bancrofti in ner from each of 42 Shelters once a week
     for two consecutive years in each area. PTI calculated on the basis of developmental stage
     larvae of W.bancrofti in the vector multiplied by mosquitoes caught per minute was found to be
     significantly higher in the urban (0.02) than that in the rural area (0,01). The index obtained
     by counting matured larvae Was also significantly greater in the urban (0.0045) than in the
     rural area (0.001). The trend of PTI was almost similar in both the areas and in both the
     years. This can be an useful tool for evaluating transmission dynamics and control measures of

     this study was to determine the status of reservoir host of cut- aneous leishmaniasis in
     Khistan-Ilam provinces during 1981-1988, Stray dogs and rodents " Tatera indica, Nesokia india,
     Meriones libycus erythrorus , Rettus rattus and Mus musculus " were examined for leishmania
     parasites.Smear from le- sions were injected into white mice to find out the nature of
     parasites.</p>
    <p>In Dashteazadegan one out of 37 Meriones libycus (2.74) was naturally infected with le-
     ishmania and five dogs showed sores on their noses,L.D bodies were recoverd from all of
     them.</p>
    <p>In Mussian-Dehloran area we found that Tatera indica and Nesokia indice acting as the
     reservoir host and 10 out of 80 Tatera (12.5%) and one out of 14 Nesokia (7%) were nat- urally
     infected and we also found two dogs naturally infected with leishmania.</p>
    <p>The behaviour of parasite in laboratory animals is smilior to leiskmanis major that is highly
     pathogenic to laboratory white mice.</p>
    <p>In conclusion, both rodents and dogs are considered to play important role as the rese- rvoir

    <p>MALARIA PRIORITY AREAS AND POPULATION GROUPS IN SOUTH EAST ASIA A.V.Kondrashin, World Health
     Organization, South East Asia Region, New Delhi 110002, India Malaria Risk, Population Groups -
     Asia The proportion of malaria cases in different population groups contributing to the overall
     malaria incidence in South East Asia over a number of years has been used as a criterion in the
     identification of high risk groups in the malarious countries of the region. Analysis of
     several factors, including the level of malaria endemicity, seasonality of transmision, vector
     behaviour, vector density, vector bionomics and transmission dynamics were used as criteria for
     the identification of malaria priority areas. Forests, forested hills, forest fringe areas,
     developmental project sites and border areas accorded highest priority in all countries, as did
     rubber and coffee plantations, tea gardens, irrigated plains and urban areas in some countries.
     Infants, young children and pregnant women had been identified as malaria high risk groups in
     all countries, followed by mobile population groups, particularly those engaged in
     forest-related economy, gem mining, fishing, industrial and road construction work and the
     like. Ethnical minorities, refugees, displaced persons, tourists and pilgrims constitute
     malaria high risk groups in a few countries of the Region. Identification and monitoring of
     priority areas and high risk population groups in the countries of the Region will serve as a
     basis for the development of an Epidemiological Early Warning System (EEWS) which will predict
     forthcoming malaria epidemies and facilitate their prevention.</p>
    <p>S6.E 35 P.+O PRESENT MALARIA STATUS IN SOUTH EAST ASIA A.V.Kondrashin, World Health
     Organization, South East Asia Region, New Delhi 110002, India.</p>
    <p>Malaria - South East Asia The malaria situation in the countries of the Region has not shown
     significant change, in terms of reduction of disease incidence, for the last few years. The
     technical problems, such as vector resistace to insecticides and parasite resistance to drugs,
     have continued to pose serious obstacles to the control of malaria in most countries of the
     Region. The situation has been further complicated by a considerable increase in population
     mobility,by the refractory behaviour of some principal malaria vectors,and by communities not
     accepting some antimalaria measures. Shortages of adequate trained manpower and weaknesses in
     the managerial framework have continued to hinder malaria control programmes. Approximately 2.4
     million malaria cases were recorded in the Region in 1988 as against 2.8 million in 1987 and
     2.7 million in 1986. The overall malaria situation in 1988 remained unchanged in Bangladesh,
     Bhutan, India, Indonesia and Nepal,while an upward trend was observed in Myanmar and Thaïland.
     The malaria situation in Sri Lanka has shown an improvement over the last three years. An
     increase in P.falciparum has been observed only in Bangladesh, Myanmar and Thaïland, though its
     resistant strains are now widely distributed in all endemic countries of the Region except
     Maldives. Malaria control programmes are actively implementing the revised malaria control
     strategy through the Primary Health Care system, and attempts have been made to adapt the new
     strategy to the local epidemiological situation identified in the course of malaria
     stratification exercises. The objective is to adopt stratum-specific approaches to tackle the
     main technical constraints, such as resistance of parasites to antimalarials and resistance of
     malaria vectors to insecticides.</p>

    <p>This work is the first extensive epidemiological study concerning bovine babesiosis in
     France.The investigations have been done by sending a ques- tionnaire to 1480 veterinary
     surgeons and by identification of Babesia species in oxen on Giemsa stained thin blood
     smears.</p>
    <p>Collected data indicate that : - Babesia divergens is the major causative agent of bovine
     babesiosis in France.</p>
    <p>- À precise map of the breakdown of the infection in France has been set- led,showing a high
     incidence in western, central and southern part of France.</p>
    <p>- Analysis of epidemiological data using several parameters, is linked to topography (bocage,
     forests, brooks) season (spring:60%, summer:10%, autumn:30%), age of the animals (two years and
     more), production (dairy cows) and delay between the introduction of the oxes in susceptible
     areas and the development of the infection.</p>
    <p>- Clinical symptomatology is variable but typical.</p>
    <p>- À decreased incidence is observed in some areas due to the disapea- rance of hedges and
     slopes as well as the use of a chemoprophylaxis.</p>
    <p>- Incidence of Babesia major is low and restricted to small areas. .</p>
    <p>In France, B.divergens can be considered as the maior agent of babesiosis.</p>
    <p>A better knowledge of the geographical and temporal distribution will be useful to develop an

     chimiothérapie présomptive des syndromes fébriles de l'enfant est la principale méthode de
     lutte antipaludique utilisée en Afrique tropicale. Cette étude menée dans un dispensaire de
     Pikine (banlieue de Dakar) de mai 1987 à avril 1988 avait pour but: (1) de mesurer la part de
     traitements adéquats et inutiles que la chimiothérapie présomptive conduit à administrer dans
     une grande ville d'Afrique soudano-sahélienne où le paludisme est hypoendémique; (2) de tester
     différents critères cliniques et épidémiologiques afin d'identifier ceux présentant - isolément
     ou en combinaison - la meilleure sensibilité, spécificité, valeur prédictive positive et valeur
     prédictive négative.</p>
    <p>1010 enfants agés de moins de 15 ans dont la température était égale ou supérieure à 38°C
     lors de leur arrivée au dispensaire ont été enrôlés dans l'étude. Pour chaque enfant ont été
     pratiqués un interrogatoire et un examen clinique approfondis (35 paramètres étudiés) et une
     goutte épaisse.</p>
    <p>159 enfants (15,7%) présentaient une goutte épaisse positive (dans la population étudiée, le
     taux fortuit attendu de gouttes épaisses positives était de 2,6%). L'analyse des résultats
     montre que pour les paramètres étudiés, plusieurs combinaisons de 3 ou 4 critères permettent
     d'atteindre une sensibilité de 95-96% associée à une valeur prédictive négative de 97-98%, mais
     que la spécificité n'est alors au maximum que de 33% et la valeur prédictive positive de 21%.
     Pour atteindre 50% de spécificité, on est contraint d'abaisser la sensibilité à 86% tandis que
     la valeur prédictive positive reste à un niveau faible (25%). Le meilleur critère clinique est
     la présence d'une fièvre élevée.</p>
    <p>Toutefois, la clinique est trés souvent trompeuse: 56% des cas de paludisme n'ont pas été
     suspectés au terme de cet examen. Les meilleurs critères épidémiologiques sont la saison et
     l'age de l'enfant.</p>
    <p>Malgré le taux considérable de traitements inutiles que la chimiothérapie présomptive conduit
     à administrer, aucun critère de sélection des malades ne parait en mesure d'abaisser trés
     sensiblement ce taux sans avoir également pour conséquence de laisser sans traitement de
     nombreux enfants non immuns atteints de paludisme.</p>

    <p>Data presented are the result of a malaria prevalence survey among the population of Ponan, a
     village in the Tai sous-prefecture of the. Ivory- coast. This village is situated in an area
     where intense deforestation is making place for small scale produstion of coffee, cacao and
     recently Hevea-rubber. Heavy migration into the area particularly from Burkina Faso has
     resulted in a local population with 77 percent allochtones.</p>
    <p>The malaria survey was carried-out during the second half of the long rain season of 1989.
     The sample examined comprised 10.5 percent of the total population. The malaria-prevalence
     observed was relatively low, 34.5 per- cent in the 0-14 years age-group. Spleen-indices for the
     1-4, 5-9 and 10-14 years age-groups were respectively 30, 31 and 28 percent.</p>
    <p>Chloroquine was shown to be present at very low levels in the centrally located part of the
     population an to be virtually absent in the rest of the population.</p>
    <p>This data support a case for moderate transmission at the meso-endemic level. À transmission
     model based on a landuse hypothesis may be developed to explain the transmission dynamics of
     this situation. This in turn may indicate possibilities for integration of agriculture and

    <p>Les 4 zones géoclimatiques de Madagascar conditionnent 4 faciès épidémiologiques du palu-

     Index Paludométriques(Il.Parasitaire,l.Gamétocytaire,I.Splénique)ainsi que la pré- sence en IFI
     et en MIFA à la recherche d'anticorps antiplasmodiaux totaux et anti RESA.</p>
    <p>Sur la Côte Est,au climat humide et chaud toute l'année les I.P.,1.G. et I.S. sont res-
     pectivement de 90%,15% et 46% dans les villages entourés de rizières.En IFI, 100% des sérums
     sont positifs et en MIFA,43,5% possèdent des anti RESA.Dans les agglomérations les Index
     Paludométriques sont nettement inférieurs: 50%,5% et 21% et les variations sérolo- giques sont
     surtout sensibles pour les anticorps anti RESA.</p>
    <p>Sur la Côte Ouest et sur le versant Ouest des Hauts Plateaux qui subissent une saison sèche
     de 4 à 6 mois, les Index sont respectivement de 75%, 10% et 50%. En IFI et en MIFA les taux de
     positivité sont de 95% et de 35%.</p>
    <p>Sur les Hauts Plateaux qui connaissent une saison sèche et fraîche de 6 mois, la situa- tion
     est également hétérogène avec des IP variant significativement de 40 à 60% et des IS de 13 à
     23%. Les IG sont identiques à 4% de même que les taux de positivité en IFI (92%) et en MIFA

    <p>Depuis 1986-1987 ,une nouvelle épidémie de paludisme a frappé les Hauts Plateaux malgaches
     qui étaient déclarés zone de surveillance par 1'O0.M.S. depuis le début des années 70.Afin de
     comprendre l'évolution des phénomènes, nous avons suivi mensuellement, de Novembre 1988 à
     Novembre 1989 une cohorte de 600 habitants d'un village prodhe de la capitale, avec
     détermination sur goutte épaisse des Index Parasitaires (I.P.), Gamétocytaires (I1.G.), et par
     examen clinique des Index Spléniques (1.S.).</p>
    <p>Dans le même temps, des enquêtes entomologiques ont eu lieu mensuellement avec capture sur
     homme(816 nuits),en faune résiduelle et en puits de MUIRHEAD THOMPSON.Les vecteurs ont été
     déterminés optiquement et la présence de sporozoîtes recherchée par ELISA avec des anticorps
     monoclonaux spécifiques d'espèce.</p>
    <p>Dans cette région,les vecteurs sont Anopheles arabiensis et A.funestus.Ils apparaissent en
     Novembre avec un pic de Décembre à Février pour ensuite diminuer sensiblement et disparaître de
     Juillet-Août à Novembre. Le nombre de piqûres infestantes par homme et par an est de 1 à 2. Au
     plan parasitaire, le portage est constant avec des I.P. toujours supérieurs à 30% et un pic en
     Avril-Mai supérieur à 50%. Les I.G. varient de 4,3 à 13%. Les I.S. de 10 à 33%.</p>
    <p>Cette étude montre que la transmission sur les Hauts Plateaux dure de Décembre à Mai, qu'elle
     est peu importante. La persistance d'une saison à l'autre d'un nombre élevé de porteurs de
     Plasmodium falciparum (trophozoïte et gamétocytes) dans la population, explique en ['absence de

     first recorded as the region is a endemic area. The intradermal tests made on 337 peasants with
     antigens prepared from adult paragonimus,there were 53 positives (15.7 % ) from the endemic
     area, Two species of snails were incrimmated as the first intermediate hosts of paragoninus.
     The first spicies,Tricula sp.,was found 2 positives among 2026 snails examined (0,099 % ).The
     second species, Semisulcospira libertina, was also found 9 positives of 18748 snails examined
     (0.048 % ). Four species of crabs, Sinopotamon denticulatum, Nanhaïpotamon formosanum,
     Somanniathelphusa sinensis sinensis, and Potamon hispidum were found to be naturally infected
     with cyst of Paragonimus.</p>
    <p>454 crabs were examined, there were 293 positives (64.5 % ). Among them,Sinopotamon
     denticulatum is the highest (77.81 % ). There were found four species of metacercarial cyst in
     crabs mentioned above. They are Paragonimus westermani, P.Skriabini, P. asymmetricus and
     Euparagonimus cenocopiosis. Adult worms of Paragonimus westermani were found as natural

     Dans le cadre d'un Projet de recherche appliquée de la Coopération Italo-Malgache, des enquêtes
     épidémiologiques ont été effectuées depuis 1988, afin de déterminer le degré d'endémicité du
     paludisme dans diverses zones éco-épidémiologiques de Madagascar. Une étude longitudinale de la
     faune anophélienne et de la prévalence du paludisme chez les enfants scolarisés a débuté dans
     certains villages des environs d'Antananarivo. Une enquête transversale a également été menée,
     en décembre 1989 dans des villages des provinces d'Antananarivo, Fianarantsoa, Tulear et
     Manakara. Les données requeillies dans les formations sanitaires visitées indiquent que le
     paludisme, dont le diagnostic est posé sur des bases cliniques, représente 13-20% du total des
     consultations dans les centres médicaux et 30-33$% dans les postes de santé où ne fonctionnent
     que des infermiers. Les indices plasmodiques varient fortement, même entre villages voisins
     (1,1-59,6%). C'est le cas des ceux situés dans les environs d'Antananarivo mais dans lesquels
     aucune lutte anti-vectorielle n'est entreprise. La prévalence varie également selon les grupes
     d'âge, atteignant le maximum entre 5 et 10 ans. Dans le village d'Analaroa, situé à 80 Km au
     nord d'Antananarivo, où la présence d'un laboratoire équippé et d'un médecin a permis
     l'exécution systématique des examins sanguins depuis 1987, la distribution des cas de paludisme
     présente un pic saisonnier entre mars et mai. Le données entomologiques recueillies dans les
     divers villages, au moyen des captures nocturnes effectuées sur appât humain et après
     pulvérisation de pyrèthre, sont en accord avec les niveaux de prévalence relevés. Les résultats
     de cette étude montrent une hétérogénéité de la distribution de l'endémie paludéenne surtout
     sur les Hautes Terres. D'autres enquêtes épidémiologiques seraient nécessaires pour mieux
     comprendre les spécificités qui sont à l'origine de ces différences, ainsi que pour définir les
     zones prioritaires pour les interventions anti-paludiques.</p>

    <p>Mansonella streptocerca - Onchoceroiasis - Island of Bioko - Equatorial Guinea vas first
     reported on the island of Bioko (formerly Fernando Péo) in 1936. In 1981 a case of
     streptocerciasis was observed associated with onchocerciasis. The prevalence of M, streptocerca
     had never been previously studied on Bioko. The present study was initiated ïin 1989 during an
     onchocerciasis survey to determine the current disease situation in the rural population living
     in cocoa plantations and tropical rain forest.</p>
    <p>The whole population (415 people) of three villages in the District of Riaba
     (southern-eastern part of the island) were surveyed. Identification data and physical
     examination were performed. Skin snips were taken from both iliac crest right scapula and calf
     regions, using Walser punch and incubated for 24 hours in isotonic saline. Deferential
     diagnosis with Onchocerca volvulus was carried out in both fresh and Giemsa stained
     preparations.</p>
    <p>The overall prevalence (+ skin snips) was 20.4 % (range 15.1 % to 23.4 %). Skin snips taken

    <p>sleeping sickness, Glossinà, animal reservoir Towards the end of 1988 a localized outbreak of
     sleeping sickness occurred in Ivlowa sub-countv, S.E. Uganda. A survey was made to estimate the
     epidemiological importance of domestic livestock as reservoirs for human sleeping sickness. The
     following para- meters were examined: the relative importance of different hosts to the flv
     population, infection rates in the flies and the numbers of T. b. rhodesiense infected hosts -
     both human and animal.</p>
    <p>Lancien traps were used to sample the G. f. fuscipes fly population, 0.14% of which had T.
     brucei infections. Analysis of fly bloodmeals showed that cattle and monitor lizards were the
     primary fly hosts. The incidence in the human population was approxi- mately 0.06%. The brucei
     trypanosome infection rate in cattle was 4.9 .</p>
    <p>25% cattle isolates were human serum resistant in vitro and therefore potentiallv human
     infective; these trypanosomes showed the same isoenzvme profile as 11 of the 12 isolates from
     human sleepina sickness cases.</p>
    <p>Calculations show that it is 500 times more likely that a human sleeping sickness patient
     contracted the disease from cattle rather than man. Wild animals appear to nlay little or no
     part in the epidemiology of the disease in this area.</p>

     affected. Localization predominated on the face followed by ears and arms. Multiple lesions
     were observed in 35% of the LCL patients and recurrence within a 2 year period in 12.3%. The
     duration of an active lesion was above 1 year in about half of the cases. Scars of LCL were

     étude entomologique, parasitologique et sérologique du paludisme se déroule dans trois
     localités du Sud Cameroun. Un des buts de cette étude est d'analyser la relation entre : -
     l'acquisition/évolution des anticorps anti-sporozoïtes dans les principales classes d'âge des
     populations et - l'intensité de la transmission du paludisme.</p>
    <p>Les trois zones d'étude sélectionnées sont : + MBÉBÉ, un village traditionnel de 500
     habitants, situé en forêt, au bord du fleuve Sanaga. Les soins médicaux y sont donnés dans un
     dispensaire mais il n'y a ni médecin, ni pharmacie.</p>
    <p>La transmission du paludisme est permanente et est estimée à une centaine de piqûres
     infestées par homme et par an.</p>
    <p>+ À Yaoundé, la capitale du Cameroun, regroupant 800 000 habitants : le quartier NKOL BISSON,
     zone périphérique et en cours d'urbanisation mais qui présente encore un certain caractère
     rural.</p>
    <p>La transmission du paludisme est estimée à 25 piqûres infestées par homme et par an.</p>
    <p>+ À Edéa, une ville de 40 000 habitants située au bord du fleuve Sanaga : le quartier
     BILALANG où habitent les employés de l'usine d'aluminium ALUCAM. Ce quartier est pourvu
     d'électricité, d'eau courante, d'évacuation des ordures et d'un bon système d'égout. De
     nombreuses mesures antivectorielles y sont prises comme le traitement extérieur des maisons à
     la deltaméthrine et l’utilisation de moustiquaires imprégnées de deltaméthrine. Le Centre
     Médical d'ALUCAM distribue gratuitement de la chloroquine en prophylaxie et traite le paludisme
     clinique avec de la quinine.</p>
    <p>La transmission du paludisme est estimée à moins de 5 piqûres infestées par homme et par
     an.</p>
    <p>Pour l'étude sérologique on effectue quatre prélèvements annuels de sang dans les
     populations. La détermination des anticorps anti-sporozoîtes est faite par une technique ELISA
     avec l'antigène R32tet32 spécifique des sporozoîtes de Plasmodium falciparum. A Mbébé, pour
     chaque tranche d'âge, la densité optique moyenne (DOM) est beaucoup plus élevée que dans les
     autres populations ; à partir de 11 ans la DOM atteint un maximum puis reste constante. A Nkol
     Bisson, pour chaque tranche d'âge, la DOM est plus élevée que la DOM à Bilalang. Dans ces deux
     dernières populations il y a une augmentation continue de la DOM avec l'âge.</p>
    <p>La dynamique d'acquisition des anticorps anti-sporozoîïtes et le niveau moyen observé chez

    <p>We have studied the incidence of canine leishmaniosis by determination _ of anti-leishmania
     antibodies. Most dogs belonged to pack of hounds procceding from Caceres province (West of
     Spain).</p>
    <p>The method used was Indirect Fluorescent Antibody (IFA) test. We obtained the antigen from a
     massive culture of Leishmania infantum promastigotes in the semi-defined medium 199 added with
     a 2% of fetal calf serum substitute (Ultroser G).</p>
    <p>One thousand one hundred and twenty two sera samples procceding from 16 localities were
     tested. These localities were grouped in 9 regions depending on their climatic and topographic
     characteristics.</p>
    <p>The mean incidence (titre &gt; 1/80) observed was 9.98% (112 positive sera samples)
     irregularly distributed in the differente ecological areas studied.</p>
    <p>We have found some focus with a high parasitation (Sierra de la Mosca: 30.35%; Coria: 17.64%
     ; Trujillo: 14.06%), and also places with no or a very low parasitation levels.</p>
    <p>The important endemic situation of canine leishmaniosis at some different areas in Caceres
     province is demostrated after comparing the percentages of parasitation by means of a

    <p>FAUNA OF WATER-BIRDS HYMENOLEPIDID OF ARMENIAN MOUNTAIN LAKE SEVAN P.Sevak str.7,

     By the method of full helminthological revelation 190 bird specimens arranged in 7 species and
     4 orders were investigated:Anseriformes (Anas platyrhynchos, Casarca ferruginea), Gruiformes
     (Fulica atra), Charadrii- formes (Actitis hypoleucos, Calidris minutus, Tringa glareola),
     Podici- pitiformes (Podiceps griseigena).</p>
    <p>In case of invasion intensity from 1 to 1560 cestode specimens, birds invasion extensity was
     made to be 48,%. For the present 11 hymenolepidid species were diagnosed. The number,
     undoubtedly, will change by comple- ting the procession of all collected materials from 500
     bird specimens.</p>
    <p>Cestode species from the genera Aploparaksis and Diorchis happen more of ten. The original
     description and the figures of the mentioned cestode species were given. Birds infection occurs
     in summer, mainly in July and August, when the lake's water temperature reaches +24°C. During
     this sea son the presence and activity of cestodes' intermediate hosts, i.e. cyc- lopes, are
     optimum. In other seasons of the year cestodes' development is delayed because of temperature
     limit (+20°C below).</p>
    <p>Thus, in conditions of mountain Lake Sevan (more than 2000m.above sealevel) the invasion
     period of intermediate and definitive hosts is short in connection with insufficiency of

    <p>EPIDEMIOLOGY OF ONCHOCERCIASIS Screening for human onchocerciasis among 2,566 residents of 18
     villages in Rukuba Hills of Plateau State between October, 1987 and Aggust, 1988 revealed that
     103 (L.0%) had skin microfilariae, 65 (2.5%) had onchocercal noduies, 36 (1.%) had hanging
     groins while 32(1.2%) had genital elephantiasis, infection rate was higher in females than in
     males. Gradual increase of the disease prevalence with advancing age was observed. Decrease in
     infection rate was significantly correlated with increased distance from the breeding site.
     Outdoor workers like farmers and nomads has higher infection rates than other occupational
     groups. Concurrent association of chilcal signs of onchocerciasis and the presence of skin
     microfilariae was not always the rule. The implications of these findings will be presented
     with other observations.</p>

     Korea Brugia malayi, brugian filariasis, Aedes togoi, filaremia Brugia malay is the only known
     species of filaria in Korea. Filariasis bad presumab] y/een endemic in some parts of the
     country for several centuries, The highest prevalence occurred in the past in Cheju Island (mf
     rate — 30.3%) and the next in south-westèrn part of the Korean peninsula (nf rate — 11.24). The
     disease has been on a descending trend since the 1970s. This study was carried out to obtain
     additional information on the present prevalence of micrifilaremia among people in former
     endemic areas and also to find out factors pertaining to the disappearance of filariasis in
     Korea.</p>
    <p>Investigations were carried out in Docho Island in 1987 and in Cheju Is. in 1988.</p>
    <p>A 20 mm’blood was taken from villagers by house-to-house visit at night between 22:00 and
     01:00 hours. The slides were stained with Giemsa and were examined under microscope, À total of
     195 smears ta ken from villagers in Docho Is. revealed negative for microfilaria. Of a total of
     357 blood smears taken, only one positive case for microfilaremia was found (mf rate - 0.3 %)
     in Cheju Is. Six females and one male of Aedes togoi (the vector species) were collected from
     14 bedrooms (0.4/bedroom).</p>
    <p>Only one Ae. togoi was collected by indoor human biting catches ( 0.2/man/hour).</p>
    <p>Thus, the adult population density of the vector seemed to be very low. The use mosquito-nets
     and aerosol insecticides was found in more than 90 % of households, Reviewing available
     information on the prevalence of filariasis reported in recent years in Korea and also the
     results of this study, it can be said with confidence that filariasis has alomost been
     disappeared from Korea, If the present trends go on, the possibility of resurgence of
     filariasis in Korea is hardly postulated.</p>

    <p>Piroplasm - Babesia - Theileria - Greece - Domestic animal A study was carried out on the
     presence of haematozoons in the livestock of Macedonia. During the 1984-1986 period, 602 serum
     samples were collec- ted from cattle in 33 localities, 721 from sheep in 49 localities and 487
     from goats in 43 localities. For some of the animals blood smears were also prepared.</p>
    <p>The indirect fluorescent antibody (IFA) test revealed that 41.4% of cattle sera were positive
     to Theileria orientalis, 2.0% to T.annulata, 21.6% to Babesia bovis, 15.2% to B.bigemina, 5.1%
     to B.major and 2.7% to B.divergens. T.orientalis has a wide distribution. Animals from 28 loca-
     lities showed antibodies against this parasite. B.bigemina and B.bovis are often present
     together. Cattle possessed antibodies against these piroplasms in 18 and 15 localities
     respectively.</p>
    <p>The prevalence of IFA activity for sheep and goat sera respectively was: 24.6 and 0.6% for
     T.ovis, 52.1 and 36.4% for B.ovis, 10.5 and 4.2% for B.motasi, 12.6 and 6.6 $% for B.crassa.
     B.ovis is a widespread parasite.</p>
    <p>Antibodies against it were found in animals from more than 90% of the lo- calities. T.ovis is
     also common, but it is confined essentially to sheep.</p>
    <p>Some positive titres of cattle, sheep and goat sera, were probably due to cross reactions,
     mainly when mixed infections occurred.</p>
    <p>By examination cf Giemsa stained blood smears T.orientalis, T.annulata and a Babesia sp. were
     detected in cattle, T.ovis and B.ovis in sheep, and Anaplasma ovis in a goat.</p>

    <p>Cutarecus leishmaniasis, caused by protczoan parasite, Leishmania tropica, is à disease of
     great zoonotic importance in semidesert and desert regions of Rajasthan (India) (Pathak, 1987).
     During the period of 24 months, prevalence of dry form of cutareous leishmaniasis, both in man
     and dogs was recorded in Eikaner and its surroundings. Eight hundred dogs were examined, Cut of
     them eighty had cutaneous lesions on the limbs, tail, vulver lips, facial crest, external ears
     and nostrils. Impression smear from cutaneous and nasal lesions, revealed organisms refereble
     to Leishmania tropica. In man, lesions were present on the elbow, forearms, ankles, nose, face,
     lips and neck.</p>
    <p>Lesions were present in age groups ranging from 2 to 17 years. Since the disease was endemic
     in dogs and human beirgs än the same area, it is very likely that the disease had been
     transmitted from dogs to man.</p>

     A. Moren Leishmaniose viscérale, prévalence, Soudan, leishmania Donovani En octobre 1988, les
     équipes de Médecins Sans Frontières Hollande travaillant à Khartoum ont commencé à observer un
     nombre croissant de cas de Kala-Azar (KA),Leishmania Donovani. La grande majorité des personnes
     atteintes étaient des Nuers venant d'une même région, l'ouest du Haut-Nil (région de Bentiu).
     Dans le but d'évaluer l'importance d'une éventuelle épidémie de KA, d'identifier la population
     à risque et de formuler des recommandations pour le dépistage et le traitement des cas, une
     enquête épidémiologique fut réalisée en avril 1989.</p>
    <p>La première partie de l'étude a été réalisée à l'hôpital de Leer et a permis de confirmer le
     diagnostic, de préciser la définition d'un cas de leishmaniose viscérale. Sur les 125 malades
     hospitalisés pour suspicion de KA, 121 (97 %) étaient porteurs d'anticorps (test
     immunofluorescence) et les signes cliniques les plus fréquemment rencontrés étaient fièvre (79
     %), splénomégalie (59 %), anémie (54 %), lymphadénopathie (48 %).</p>
    <p>Une étude par échantillonnage aléatoire simple (N = 362) a permis de mesurer la prévalence de
     l'infection parmi la population générale (23,7 %). Cette prévalence était plus marquée chez les
     adultes (27,7 %) que chez les enfants (18 %) ainsi que chez les femmes (25,6 %) comparativement
     aux hommes(20 %).</p>
    <p>Bien qu'il s'agisse d'une prévalence d'anticorps sur une population saine, ces résultats
     reflètent un énorme problème de santé publique pour le pays, problème passé inaperçu pendant

    <p>Le mécanisme de la contamination humaine pourrait suivre le processus mis en évidence dans un
     village du Cézalier de 1982 à 1988. 1°) Le renard sauvage contamine les rongeurs des espaces
     forestiers et ruraux. 2°) Ces rongeurs contaminent les carnivores domesti- ques (chiens surtout
     et, plus difficilement, chats). Ces carnivores réinfestent à leur tour les rongeurs sauvages de
     l'espace rural. 3°) Le chien contaminé, en pénêtrant faci- lement dans les espaces
     domiciliaires, souille l'environnement humain et infeste les rongeurs domestiques, témoins de
     cette contamination, et l'homme.</p>
    <p>Ce mode de circulation du parasite dans la chaîne animale est sans doute réalisable dans
     d'autres foyers d'échinococcose alvéolaire et explicite nombre d'infestations hu- maines sans
     contact direct ou indirect avec un renard. La prophylaxie de la maladie humaine pourrait dès
     lors consister dans une vermifugation périodique des chiens qui vivent dans les régions
     d'endémie à risque élevé.</p>

     en particulier dans la municipalité de Sao Bento.</p>
    <p>L'étude est basée sur les données statistiques de la SUCAM, organisme chargé du contrôle des
     grandes endémies, et les observations de terrain faites par une équipe franco-brésilienne.</p>
    <p>À Sao Bento (23509 habitants) au centre d'un immense marécage, la prévalence globale en 1977
     était de 13% mais dépassait 45% dans les foyers de plus haute transmission. Les traitements
     annuels ont fait baisser ces taux mais très lentement et très irrégulièrement: 1981: 23% -
     1982: 11% - 1983: 6% - 1984: 3,3% - 1985: 8,5% - 1986: 7,3% - 1987 7,4% - 1988 3%.</p>
    <p>Le maintien de cette transmission résiduelle est dû à diverses causes: méthodologiques:
     valeur des dépistages et des traitements, et épidémiologiques: habitat lacustre, activités de

     reports on the epidemiology and biology of Gnathostoma hispidum în Susong district,Anhui
     Province,China.During 1987 to 1988,a total of 1,213 pigs were examined and 286 of them(23.6%X)
     were found to be infected with G.hispidum.The incidence rate varied from 21% to 46%. The
     positive pigs around the lake region were 33.5% and 8.8% from the non-lake region.About 386
     fresh-water fishes belonging to 9 families,16 genera and 19 species were examined,and 7 species
     of them were infected with the advanced 3rd-stage larva of G.hispidum.They are Cyprinus
     carpio,Opsariichthys uncirostris bidens, Misgaurnus anguillicaudatus,Psudobagrus
     fulvidraco,Ophicephalus argus,Monopterus albus, and Siniperca chuatis.The number of larvae per
     fish varied from 1-55 with an average of 10. It was found that Rana tigrina rugulosa and
     R.nigromaculata served as the paratenic hosts.As mentioned above, the authors considered that
     Susong district must be regarded as an highly endemic area where pigs suffered cruel infection
     with G.hispidum through- out all the year. The specifis characters of both species of
     Gnathostoma larvae,G.his- pidum and G.spinigerum were described.</p>

     G.hispidum.A total of 13525 fishes belonging 31 genera and 34 species were examined and 14
     species of them were found to be naturally infected with the advanced 3rd-stage larvae of
     G.hispidum and 13 species of them served as the second intermediate hosts of both G.hispidum
     and G.spinigerum,i.e. Cyprinus carpio,Opsariichthys uncirostris bidens,Hemibarbus
     maculatus,Culter erythropterum,Erythroculter iliskaeformis,Parasilurus asotus,Misgaurnus
     anguillicaudtus,Psudobagrus fulvidraco,Anguilla fiponica,Ophicephatus argus,Monopterus
     albus,Siniperca chuatis and Odontobutis obscurus, The tests were first demonstrated that Macaca
     mulatta can act as the second intermediate host and paratenic host of the nematode.The domestic
     cat and white rat were experimentally made on skin pe- netration of advanced 3rd-stage larvae
     of G.hispidum obtained from the fist.The results of the test were allpositive.The surveys of
     epidemiology and biology of G.hispidum are quite similar to G.spinigerum.As mentioned above,
     the authors consider that human beings may be infected by G.hispidum,which is one of zoonoses,

     Population - Impact on Malaria Malaria is endemic in certain ecologically favourable areas with
     specific vector population, increased possiblity of vectors and host contact, is seen in
     project areas like Nagarjuna Sagar, Hydro-electric projects like Upper and Lower Sileru,
     Srisailam and Vishakhapatnam Steel Plant areas in Andhra Pradesh, which is due to migration of
     rural population and their poor living conditions and non-hygenic habits. This present study
     deals with the problem of labour migration and its impact on incidence of malaria.</p>
    <p>An analysis is carried out on (a) socio-economic basis of the disease transmission, (b)
     nutritional status of the community, (c) prevalence of other infectious diseases (d) effect-
     iveness of health services (e) literacy rates in the pre-disposed colony, (f) prevelence rates
     of reservoirs.</p>
    <p>4496 cases were observed - 129 positive cases were detected. Incidence of malaria is at peak
     during the months of September to January. P.V. infection is more prevalent than p.f. The
     reported malaria incidence for males is considerably higher than that for females. For
     instance, in 1988 to 1989 - before and after treatment their correlation has been tabulated.
     The implication of these findings on malaria transmission is discussed.</p>

     Università "La Sapienza", Roma, Italy.</p>
    <p>In this study hospital records of pediatric malaria cases were used with the aim of obtaining
     homogeneous longitudinal data on the recent malaria epidemic striking Antana- narivo, In the
     hospital case register each case is noted with the following information: name, sex age,
     weight, address and the clinical diagnosis at discharge, Illness, coma and death due to malaria
     were separately noted together with the species identified in the laboratory and with other
     diseases if present in the same patient. The geographical localisation of malaria was studied
     on the basis of patients’ address, assuming low mobility of the pediatric population. From 1970
     to 1988 malaria cases in the Pediatric Service "A" of the Befelatanana General Hospital
     increased from 0,1% to 14,4% of all admissions (about 1760 per year), The admittance rate and
     the proportionate mortality rate of malaria increased moderately in 1984 (p=,014), then
     markedly in 1985 and 1986 (pt{.001) and stabilized from 1986 to 1988 (p=.91), As opposed to
     previous years, in 1983 there was an increase (p{.001) of the proportion of cases coming from
     the immediate periphery of Antananarivo (within a distance of 15 km), Most of the malaric
     children came from the periphery of the city, while 73% of the patients with other diseases
     came from the city itself (as defined by the administrative limits of Antananarivo-Ville) This
     is mainly related to the higher malaria transmission in the periurban area, The present study

    <p>Trichinellosis - Seroepidemiology - swine-human.</p>
    <p>The high incedence of trichinellosis outbreaks in the survey area is the goal of this study,
     including human and swine seroprevalences. Two swine groups were analyzed: 354 sera from pigs
     grew in small farm regimen from 21 different villages and 214 sera from stabled indoor pigs.
     Two different ELISA methods were performed: one using a frozen- thawed-sonicated antigen,
     peroxidase as enzyme and OPD as substrate, being considered positive titers} 1/80; second, the
     Idetek AVID/Porcine alkaline phosphatase kit, with positive titers when the percentage enzyme
     immunoassay coefficient is 15%, according with the commercial criteria. From the other hand,
     two groups of humans were studied: 408 sera from risk meat consumers, and 381 sera from not
     risk meat conumers. Human — IgG specific antibodies were detected by peroxidase/OPD ELISA
     test.</p>
    <p>None positive sera was found in the stabled indoor pig group; oposite, 3,1% seroposi- tive
     pigs were detected in the group grew in small farms. This seropositive group was not detected
     by direct trichinoscopy showing the low level of parasites in muscles. A high correlation was
     established by both ELISA test. 75% of the positive sera came - from 3 out of the 21 studied
     villages indicating the nidal feature of the disease.</p>
    <p>7,2% (33 out of 408) human positive sera were found in the group of consumers of mat from
     home raised pigs. 1,04% (4 out of 381) human positive sera were found in the group of not risk
     meat consumer group. The difference is statistically significant. Correla tion between
     seropositive pigs and high risk meat consumers has been established too.</p>
    <p>These results shows that in absence of symtomate oubreaks a high parasite circulation in both
     human and animal population is present, without being detected by the direct trichinoscopy.</p>

    <p>Paludisme - Immunologie - Epidemiologie - Comores Dans le cadre d'un programme de contrôle du
     paludisme et de la filariose en République Fédérale Islamique des Comores, financé par
     1l'O.M.S. et le P.N.U.D., une enquête entomologique et immunologique a été menée, d'octobre à
     décembre 1989, afin de déterminer les niveaux de transmission du paludisme dans des villages de
     différentes zones éco-géographiques. Dans chaque village, les densités des vecteurs par chambre
     ont été déterminées au moyen de captures après pulvérisation de pyrèthre. 2'541 prélèvements de
     sang ont aussi été effectués dans 8 villages de l'île de la Grande Comore, 8 d'Anjouan et 5 de
     Mohéli. Les niveaux d'anticorps antisporozoïtiques des échantillons conservés à sec, sur papier
     buvard, ont été determinés avec une technique ELISA en utilisant un peptide de synthèse,
     NANP,6, produit par ENIRicerche, (Monterotondo). Le pourcentage des sujets positifs scofgrisés
     en bas âge (5 à 10 ans) varie entre les villages de 0 à 98,2%. Sur la base de ces résultats, il
     a été possible d' individuer les villages à plus haute transmission là où une enquête
     entomologique classique avait evidencié la présence de gîtes larvaires tels que citernes et
     estuaires de rivières bouchés par le cordon littoral. En effet, les fréquences de positivité
     les plus basses ont été relevées dans l'île d'Anjouan, les plus élevées dans celle de Mohéli.
     La corrélation entre taux d'inoculation entomologiques et pourcentages de sujets positifs pour
     les anticorps antisporozoïtiques a été plus élevée pour les enfants (r=0,681; P&lt;0,001) que
     pour les adultes (r=-0,474; P&lt;0,004). Une analyse des niveaux des anticorps
     antisporozoïtiques a été menée en regroupant les différents sujets par classes d'âges. Parmi
     les 51 individus de moins de 4 ans, la positivité a été de 3,9%; parmi les 69 de 5 ans, elle a
     atteint presque 40%. Entre 6 et 9 ans, elle était d'environ 30% (1'251 individus testés). Dès
     cet âge, on a observé une augmentation progressive de la positivité qui a atteint le maximum à
     50 ans (693).</p>
    <p>L'augmentation des niveaux de positivité en rapport avec l'âge des sujets, pourrait être due
     à une plus longue exposition aux piqûres infectantes des moustiques.</p>

    <p>Fpidemiology Taeniasis/cysticercosis.</p>
    <p>In a village of Mexico where Taenia solium was known to be endemic a census identified 1,750
     households with 13,162 residents. À cluster sample of 368 households was selected for
     demographic, environmental, medical history and diagnostic surveys as CT scans (117). All
     participants were offered a taeniacidal dose of praziquantel. Of 571 pigs examined by tongue
     inspection, 4.3% had cysticerci. Lack of adequate latrines, indiscriminate disposal of human
     feces and allowing pigs to run loose were associated with risk of cysticercosis in pigs (p
     &lt;0.01). Of 1502 human serum samples, 11% tested positive in the cysticercosis immunoblot
     assay and 2.25% were positive for enzyme immunoassay. Seropositivity increased with age and
     peaked at 18% in persons aged 46-55 years. One percent of the village population suffered
     convulsions, serologic evidence suggested that 31 percent of these cases were caused by
     neurocysticercosis. Histories of chronic headaches and seizures were more common in
     seropositive than in seronegative persons (p &lt;0.05). No tapeworm eggs were identified in
     perianal scrapings or stool specimens. However, five persons passed Taenia sp. proglottids
     after taking praziquantel and 16 reported having passed proglottids in their feces within the
     previous 12 months.</p>
    <p>Preliminary analysis showed that cases were clustered within households and particularly, in
     households in which a member reported a history of having passed tapeworm proglottids and
     history of convulsions was a highly specific predictor of altered cerebral CT images compatible
     with neurocysticercosis, but most people with altered CT images did not have history of
     convulsions. In comparison with EIA, the immunoblot showed good clinical and epidemiologic
     correlations.</p>

    <p>Risk Factors Taeniasis/cysticercosis.</p>
    <p>This study was designed to define the most appropriate methods for epidemiologic assessment
     of Taeniasis/cysticercosis necessary for control programs. À rural community of 3,065
     inhabitants was selected as study site based on its representativeness and the demonstrated
     prevalence of infection in local swine. Standardized and pretested familiar and individual
     questionnaires of risk factors were applied in order to describe the ic and environmental
     characteristics. We also collected biological specimens (stool, blood samples and perianal
     scraping) as well as environmental samples. Voluntary participation was solicited and cases of
     taeniasis and cysticercosis were ascertained by direct questioning and application of several
     laboratory and clinical diagnostic techniques (CT scans and neurologic tests). All participants
     were offered a therapeutic dose of praziquantel to eliminate intestinal tapeworms. 915 blood
     samples were taken, 20 sera were positive (2.1%) for Enzyme immunoassay and 52 (5.1%) for
     Immunoblot assay.</p>
    <p>Also 828 stool samples were taken and 594 perianal scrapping, finding 0.5% of Taenia sp.</p>
    <p>eggs. Although 49 persons referred have passed proglottids in their feces (4.87%). The main
     clinical manifestations were: convulsions 2.7%; headache 25.7%, focal epilepsy 11.33%, and
     nodules subcutaneous compatible with cysticercosis 1.09%. The prevalence of porcine
     cysticercosis was 6.5% finding that pigs were more likely to be infected if they had access to
     the feces or when residents do not use latrines (p &lt;0.05). We concluded that many factors
     related to human behavior and environmental conditions in this village were conducive for
     transmission of taeniasis/cysticercosis. The serodiagnosis can be very useful in order to
     target taenia carriers for their treatment and control and for the prevention of cysticercosis
     in Mexico and many other developing countries.</p>

     of F.hepatica, and that population density of L. columella cyclically decrease between
     September and February, and increase from March to September. The hignest prevalence levels of
     infection in L. columella were: 20,0% in January; 15,38% in March; 25,0% in April; 13,97% in
     May; 8,82% in June; 19,56% in July; 10,52% in August; 18,42% in September; 10,52% in October
     and 23,07% in November, along five years of æidmioloy study. Results obtained with tracer sheep
     showed that the largest numbers of metamrcaiæ were on pasture between June and October, and
     from March to April, but the metacercariae was present during most of the year. The strategic
     control using triclabendazole to cattle of five farms, was an indication of two treatment, on
     of them in February and the other in August. At a dosage of 12,0 mg/kg the efficacy on imature
     and mature flukes was confirmed by the excretion of F. hepatica eggs ceased after six month of
     therapy. Triclabendazole was well tolerated, and the cattle staied on field with commun

     Models - Africa - Senegal In order to determine the incidence and prevalence of clinical
     malaria under typical conditions of hypoendemicity, two longitudinal studies were carried out
     in June and November 1987 among 313 and 397 schoolchildren aged 7-12 years in Pikine, a suburb
     of Dakar where malaria transmission is low and seasonal. It was established from other data
     that these two periods of the vear are those where clinical malaria incidence is minimum and
     maximum. The two studies lasted for 13 and 15 days, respectively. Each included: (1) daily
     clinical questioning and axillary temperature recording (except on Wednesday and Sunday); (2)
     two thick smears at 10-day interval; (3) extra thick smears in cases of fever or other
     symptoms: (4) home visits for each absence from school.</p>
    <p>In June, the average parasite rate was 5.1%. 17 infections were observed during the study
     period (5.4% of children). 15 of these children were positive at both survevs, one child was
     positive at the first survey only, and one child was positive at the second survey only. Of
     these 17 children, 3 had a clinical attack during the study (one primary attack and two
     probable recurrences). Other infections were asymptomatic. For the study population, malaria
     caused eight days of sickness and one day of absence from school.</p>
    <p>In the November study, the average parasite rate was 5.8%. 34 children were found to be
     infected during the study period (8.6%). 15 of these children were positive at both surveys, 8
     children were positive at the first survey only, 6 children were positive at the second survey
     only, and 4 children who were negative at both surveys were positive at other periods during
     follow-up. Of these 34 children, 21 had a clinical attack during the study (11 primary attacks,
     2 recurrences, 8 attacks which started before the beginning of the study period). For these
     children, malaria caused 81 days of sickness and 21 days of absence from school.</p>
    <p>Our observations indicate that almost ail new infections provoke clinical disease.</p>

     host This paper reports the epidemiology of two gnathostomes,Gnathostpma hispidum and G.spi-
     nigerum,and tests of G.hispidum larvae in animals.The examinations and experimental stu- dies
     found that in China,40 species of animals served as the first and second interme- diate hosts
     and paratenic hosts of these parasites, Amongthem, 30 species are common hosts of both
     G.hispidum and G.spinigerum.Our test has proved that Macaca mulatta can be infe- cted with both
     the early 3rd-stage larvae of Gshispidum in cyclops and the advanced 3rd-stage larvae in the
     fish,thus acting as both secondintermediate host and paratenic host. The domestic cat and white
     mouse were experimentally made on the intact and scrat- ched skin penetration through using
     both the early 3rd-stage larvae in cyclops and ad- vanced 3rd-stage larvae in fish. The results
     were all positive,but only the advanced 3rd-stage larvae obtained from the fish possess the
     power of infectivity. The surveys of epidemiology and tests of animals showed that the
     characters of epidemiology and biology of _G.hispidum are quite similar to G.spinigerum.In the
     light of the above, the authors believe that human may be infected by eating uncooked
     vertebrate hosts contai- ning G.hispidum larvae or drinking water carrying the larvae in
     cyclops.</p>

     information whether exists natural T.spiralis infection in horses exported from Poland, in the
     year 1989,parasitological and serological studies has been done. 1119 serum samples from 58
     voivodeships by using the ELISA test /van Knapen et all.,1987 adaptation/ were exami- ned. The
     parasitological examination have been done in 7 slauther houses, using the digestion method
     /magnetic stirrer method/.Altogether 9728 horse carcases were examined.From each horse carcase
     15g of meat was digested-it means that 5g samples from diaphragm,tongue and pharynx were
     examined.ELISA yielded positive results in 6 from among 1119 examined animals.The antibody
     T.spiralis titer ranged from 1320 to 1:40.It is interesting to underline,that among 40 horses
     coming from the same region low antibody titer in sera of 4 animals were found.in other two
     places only single positive ELISA results in horse serum was detected.No T.spira- lis larvae
     were found in 9728 horse carcases examined using the digestion method.</p>
    <p>Conclusion. Our studies confirmed the earlier observations /van Knapen and Franchimon,1990/
     that the horses in Poland practically are trichinel- losis free.</p>

     Province, Republic of Cameroon Bufo regularis, parasitic, helminths Between 1986 and 1989, 204
     Bufo regularis from the fish ponds in Bambili were necropsied and the gut and other organs were
     examined on monthly bases to determine the prevalence, mean intensity, relative density and
     species diversity of their parasitic helminths.</p>
    <p>Twenty-one helminth species wère recovered from all the organs examined, nematodes being most
     common and appearing in 93.6% hosts. The gut harboured the following nematodes: Amplicaecum
     afri um, À. pesteri, Amplicaecum sp., Camallanus sp., Cosmocerca sp., Genria tilapiae,
     Oswaldocruzia sp. and Oxysomatium sp. Rhabdias bufonis was recovered from the lungs. Trematodes
     were the next common, appearing in 27.9% hosts. The gut contained the following trematodes:
     Ganeo sp., Mesocoelium cameroonensis, Mesocoelium sp.</p>
    <p>Metadena sp. and Pleurogenoides sp. The lungs harboured Rliystomum prudhoei:, Haematolo-
     echus micrurus and H. exoterorchis. The skin, peritoneal and buccal cavities harboured
     Clinostomum metacercariae. Polystoma africanum was confined to the urinary bladder.</p>
    <p>Unidentified trematode metacercarial cysts were found in the liver. The cestode Cylin-
     drotaenia was located in the intestine of 2.9% hosts. Mean annual prevalence of infec- tion was
     95.1%. Mixed infections were common as 94.5% hosts were parasitized by 2 or more helminth
     species and over 51% by 4 or more species. Mean intensity (64.49 +17) and relative density
     (63.33 +12) were high and the range in infected hosts was 1 to 432.</p>
    <p>Differences between male and female prevalences, mean intensities and relative densities were
     not significant (P&lt;0.001). There were no marked seasonal fluctuations in the prevalence of
     helminth infection. An overdispersed distribution of helminths was observed in the hosts.</p>

    <p>Canine leishmaniasis - Prevalence - Gozo.</p>
    <p>A preliminary serum-epidemiological survey of canine leishmaniasis was done on the island of
     Gozo, Malta, in order to determine the prevalence on dogs, the sole reservoir host of the
     disease. The villages selected for the survey were Qala and Zebbug, 71% of the esti- mated dog
     population were examined in Qala and 43% in Zebbug.</p>
    <p>Blood samples were taken from every dog and notes were made of clinical signs. Specific
     antibodies anti-Leishmania were detected by Immuno-Fluorescent Antibody Test (IFAT). The
     cut-off titre was fixed at 1:80.</p>
    <p>Out of 118 dogs examined in Qala, 24 (20%) showed a positive IFAT, 18 (15%) were border line
     cases and 76 (65%) negative dogs. The results obtained in Zebbug were : 11 (17%) po sitive
     dogs, 5 (7%) border line cases and 50 (76%) negative dogs. Out of 35 positive = dogs found, 21
     (60%) showed signs of leishmaniasis.</p>
    <p>No correlation between sex and Leishmania infection has been found. The age distribution of
     positive dogs demonstrated no cases in the first six months of age and an increase of frequency
     up to the first year which remained constant in the older dogs.</p>
    <p>No significant difference in the prevalence at the time of the survey was found between both
     villages, Qala (20%) and Zebbug (17%). It is concluded that the point prevalence of canine
     leishmaniasis on the island of Gozo was 19%. Taking into account the probable dog population is
     3.600, the number of dog with the disease is 684.</p>

    <p>Vectorial Capacity, comparative epidemiology During the 1980's, the parasitological
     literature acquired a large number of papers showing that parasites can influence host choice,
     biting rate, mortality and fecundity of their insect vectors. The effects of parasites on their
     vectors highlight the practical and theoretical difficulties of obtaining an absolute measure
     of transmission rate by vectors (often called the Vectorial Capacity) in epidemiological
     studies. This paper invokes mathematical and statistical theory to argue that the practical
     response to these difficulties should be to treat indices of vector transmission rate in a
     comparative way. The general consequence for practical epidemiology is that higher priority
     should be given to the measurement of those components of the Vectorial Capacity which are
     likely to be important variables, and lower priority to the constants. Some effects of
     parasites on vectors influence only the magnitude of constants; they are more important in
     evolutionary biology than epidemiology.</p>

    <p>Influenza, epidemiology, cross-immunity.</p>
    <p>This paper investigates the interactions between the immune system and co-existing viruses on
     the dynamics of viral infections, such as influenza. Specifically, records from the United
     Kingdom and the United States of America arc examined, which indicate that cross-immunity
     between two co-existing viruses may lead to a predominance of one strain over another during
     annual epidemics. Parameters for the "force of infection", "cross-immunity coefficient",
     infectious period and age-dependant contact rate for two co-existing strains of influenza are
     estimated from serological data. It is shown that, by using these parameters in the numerical
     analysis of a series of eight coupled differential equations, it is possible to generate
     epidemic patterns similar to those observed.</p>

    <p>Frequency distribution of W. bancrofti The authors use simple mathematical models and
     statistical analyses of epidemiological data to explore the factors underlying the observed
     frequency distribution of microfilariae in human populations where lymphatic filariasis is
     endemic. The studv is based on a survey of bancroftian filariasis infection in Pondicherry, S.
     India, carried out by the Vector Control Research Centre in 1981. In the survey, age- and sex-
     stratified night blood samples were taken from 24,946 individuals and examined for
     microfilariae. A simple mathematical model predicts that the frequency distribution of
     microfilarial counts should be described statistically by a mixed Poisson distribution,
     reflecting the sampling of mf-positive individuals, with an additional proportion of ‘'true'
     mf-negatives. This is borne out by the data analysis, in which the observed frequency
     distribution of positives is fitted more closely by a zero-truncated Poisson mixture
     (zero-truncated ‘negative binomial) than by the equivalent fit including observed zeros between
     those due to sampling and ‘true' mf-negatives. The mf frequency distribution at different host
     ages is also analysed, to show a decrease in the degree of overdispersion with host age. This
     provides indirect evidence for the operation of acquired immunity to filariasis infection.</p>

    <p>population dynamics, population genetics, chemotherapy, nematodes In order to model genetic
     heterogeneity in parasite populations, it is necessary to incorporate some of the basic
     principles of population genetics into a ’host-parasite’ population dynamics framework. This
     exercise is illustrated by a simple model of parasite genetic heterogeity in directly
     transmitted nematodes, which can be used to investigate the phenomenon of drug resistance. The
     analysis reveals that the outcome of a pattern of chemotherapy has an extremely non-linear
     relationship with the intensity and frequency of application. These non-linearities are most
     apparant at high drug intensities, where, as the frequency of application declines, there is a
     complex interplay of two opposing effects on the homozygous resistant population: while the
     relative advantage over the susceptible population diminishes, the disadvantage incurred
     through heterozygote mortality declines. AS a consequence, there is no clear progression from
     fixation of resistance to disease eradication to fixation of susceptibility, as with lower drug
     intensities (where the second effect is overwhelmed by the first). Instead, the window of
     eradication is bounded on both sides by fixation of resistance, suggesting that the optimal
     frequency of chemotherapy lies within narrow and precarious limits.</p>

     dynamics, Model parametrs The approach, which is actually à synthesis of analytical ana
     simulation modelling, is suggested to investigate the influence of the environment on
     population dynamics of helminths with aplication to Dictyocaulus filaria. Highly stochastic
     environment provides oscillations din the number of parasites within the upper and lower
     limits,which are controlled by biological parameters. These limits are estimated within a
     deterministic model.</p>
    <p>The model, which describes all stages of development and age distributions within those
     stages, is a modification of the Von Foerster (1959) linear model of the age dependent
     population growth.</p>
    <p>Mathematically it is a system of partial differential equations with specific boundary
     conditions. The parasit birth and mortality rates and time of its development are the main
     model parameters. Model dynamics was analyzed for different values of parameters and various
     initial age destributions. The rise and fall in the number of helminths are revealed to be
     governed by certain combination of model parameters. There are an extensive evidence of a
     positive relation between the parameters and climatic conditions. 60, the duration of
     increasing and decreasing periods under various climatic scenarios and the number of helminths
     which could be achieved during those periods can be estimated.</p>

    <p>prevalence, mean intensity, morbidity, helminths This study examines the role of prevalence
     in the assessment of infection intensity and disease morbidity.</p>
    <p>Prevalence and mean intensity are the major variables for field evaluation of helminth
     infection and the relationship between them is determined by the frequency distribution of the
     parasites in the host population. Analysis of data on nematode and schistosome infection in a
     wide range of human communities suggests a consistent non-linear relationship between these two
     variables: only low prevalence mirrors mean intensity. This relationship has important
     practical implications for the usefulness of prevalence as a determinant of the extent of
     morbidity within a population. These implications are explored using theoretical models.</p>

    <p>Plasmodium berghei - mathematical modelling - merozoite density The aim of this preliminary
     study was to estimate the values of certain population rate parameters involved in the
     intra-erythrocytic cycle of the Plasmodium berghei-mouse system.</p>
    <p>Varying doses of purified and synchronised mature schizonts of Plasmodium berghei were used
     to inoculate C57 mice and the resulting parasitaemias were measured by sampling tailblood at
     time intervals during the following 8 hours of infection. Numbers of erythrocytes invaded by
     merozoites were calculated initially from Giemsa stains and later confirmed by fluorescence-
     activated cell sorting (FACS) analysis, when the number of cells invaded by two or more
     merozoites was also counted. Calculating the average number of merozoites released by the
     mature schizonts allowed us to assess the influence of varying merozoite density upon the rate
     of erythrocyte invasion by Plasmodium berghei in this system.</p>
    <p>Based on the experimental results, a simple mathematical model was used to study the

     Health Organization, South-East Asia Region, New Delhi 110 002, India Ecology, Mixed Malaria -
     India Longitudinal eco-epidemiological studies were conducted in a tribal belt of Central India
     in foci of meso/hyper-endemic malaria. Data analysed by TTEST and FREQ procedures of the "SAS"
     Statistical Analysis System software revealed that incidence of simultaneously contracted mixed
     malaria was considerably lower than that of sequentially contracted mixed infection. Malaria
     patients were statistically homogeneous with respect to sex,and age ranged from one to sixty
     years. Malaria species in sequential infections seemed to be dependent on the species of
     initial infection, though statistically this was not significant. Malaria species of subsequent
     infections tended to overcome the initial one though the tendency appeared to vary with the
     type of infection. It was higher for P.falciparum than for P.vivax, and variation was
     statistically significant. The phenomena probably relate to regulatory mechanisms between
     populations of malaria parasites, vertebrate hosts and mosquito vectors within malaria
     eco-systems. When contraction of simultaneous infection occurs, suppression of one species by
     another might occur because of competition for host cells and nutrients or because of
     heterologous immunity. However, in sequential mixed infections other regulatory mechanisms are
     involved, and malaria parasites may favourably affect the host environment for each other, due
     to their depressive effect on the immune system, thus, probably, resulting in the enhancement

     hydrobiological correlations and community interactions in River Ganges at Allahabad.
     Accidental infections of Proteocephalus vitellaris plerocercoids, Anthobothrium sp. and
     Comephronema sp. were also recorded. À new brown patch disease supposedly caused due to iron
     imbalance in river water has been reported in E. vacha along with frequent occurrence of skin
     lesions caused by bacterial invasions that have been correlatei with abnormal concentration of
     iron in american fishes (Welemeyer et al., 1976). The trematode and K. gynopapillata
     populations were overdispersel and showed good agreement with negative binomial model, but the
     Aistribution of other parasites could be described on Poisson series, thus confirming their
     random distribu- tion. The life span of flukes was 71 months. The non-infected fishes showed
     higher regression coefficient value (b=2.3716) than the infectei ones (b=2.2486) Aepicting

     autochthnous Lepus europaeus has been studied for “| years in Alto Adige (Italy). Our study
     began since then first serious outbreak of mortality of hares in the winter 1987. À total
     number of forty lungs of hares were examinated. The results showed a heavy monospecific
     infection by Protostrongylus pulmonalis: a very large number of larvae and adult parasites were
     found. Morpholo- gical features in male specimens showed a high variability. In particular, the
     fea- tures of gubernaculum (crura and capitulum), telamon and antero-lateral ray were dif-
     ferent by description of Protostrongylus pulmonalis found in the literature. Only few male
     specimens showed all morphological peculiarity as described by Boev (1975). The parasite
     distribution did not differ from a negative binomial (s/x&gt;52), but the k values both for the
     adult and for the larvae are very high (&gt;1 ).</p>

     Department of Biology, Imperial College, London SW7 2BB, UK Human Helminths; Chemotherapy;
     Control; Mathematical Models This paper discusses the transmission dynamics and control by
     chemotherapy of the human gastro-intestinal nematodes (Ascaris lumbricoides, Trichuria
     trichuris and the hookworms).</p>
    <p>The results of stochastic simulations are presented that hypothesise the factors that
     generate the observed heterogeneity in worm burdens within communities (ie. most people have a
     low infection, and a few people are heavily infected). Field data are discussed that may
     suggest what the heterogeneityÿ-generating processes are.</p>
    <p>À cost-benefit analysis of control of these infections by chemotherapy is presented that uses
     simple, deterministic models developed in the light of the conclusions derived from the
     stochastic models above. The emphasis is placed on the long-term benefit of different control
     strategies (as the reduction in worm burdens and disease) rather than the instantaneous cure of
     infection.</p>

    <p>HOW NEMHELIX BAKERI PARAZITING THE GENITAL TRACT OF THE SNAIL H. ASPERSA CAN SURVIVE? S.
     MORAND Nematode, Mollusc, sexual transmission, modelisation, host-parasite stability A simple
     model of prevalence dynamics for a sexual transmitted parasite of a terrestrial snail is
     constructed from empirical observations and previous laboratory resdlts.</p>
    <p>Equilibrium levels of prevalence and parasite intensity are reached because the parasite can
     reduce the fecundity of the host.</p>
    <p>Parasites can exist in a snail population only if both adult host mortality is low and
     juvenile host mortality is high. With the assumption that a carrying capacity can limit the
     adult host density, the model predicts a more severe impact of the parasite.</p>
    <p>We suppose that parasites can minimize the effects of density contraints within host
     population.</p>

    <p>Toxoplasma, epidemiology, catalytic model, congenital Aim: Investigate the time-dependent
     pattern of exposure to the protozoan parasite Toxoplasma gondii in women of childbearing age in
     Sweden and estimate the present-day incidence of congenital infections.</p>
    <p>Data: Age-stratified seroprevalence of T.gondii-specific IgG antibodies in women aged 15-45
     years from Stockholm, Sweden, from surveys conducted in 1957/8, 1969, 1979 and 1987.</p>
    <p>Method of analysis: Assuming a decay, with time, in the rate of transmission (force of
     infection, A(t)), suggested by the serological data, a catalytic infection model was fitted to
     the survey data. A variety of functions for A(t) were explored, for which parameters were
     estimated using a maximum-likelihood procedure. The risk of maternal infection was estimated
     using the best fit model to the 1987 survey data in conjunction with age-specific fertility
     records.</p>
    <p>Results: Assuming an exponential decay in À(t) the catalytic model well described
     seroprevalence trends in the most up-to-date data sets. The survey of 1957/8 provided some
     indication that the decline in À began some 40-50 years ago. A predicted À for 1987 of
     0.0048/susceptible/year (95% confidence limits, 0.01, 0.0024), yielded an expected annual risk
     of primary matemal infection of 1 in 360 pregnancies (95% CL: 1 in 170; 1 in 730).</p>
    <p>Conclusion: Whilst the estimate of the present-day À appears low, the potential risk of
     congenital infection is not inconsiderable. This is a reflection of the high proportion of
     women without immunity to the infection as revealed by the serological data. Such a result is
     of importance in relation to the design of control measures for congenital Toxoplasmosis in
     Sweden.</p>

    <p>Onchocerciasis - Disease control - Simulation model - Eye lesions ONCHOSIM is a simulation
     model for the transmission and control of onchocerciasis. It is developed in close
     collaboration with the Onchocerciasis Control Programme in West Africa (OCP), and is
     intensively used as a tool in the analysis of epidemiological and entomological data and in the
     evaluation and planning of control operations. The model comprises a detailed description of
     the life-history of O.volvulus and of its transmission by Simulium-flies. The effects of
     different control strategies, larvici- de application and chemotherapy (ivermectin), on the
     transmission and on the disease symptoms can be predicted. Alternative assumptions on the
     mechanism of transmission, the life-history of the parasite, the human demography and the
     working of drugs can easily be implemented in the model. A detailed submodel covers the
     development of lesions of the anterior and posterior segment of the eye, which results from the
     accumulation of microfilariae in the eye over a long time period. It can be shown that
     ivermectin based control is very effective as a means of preventing eye lesions and blindness,
     but that it has less potential for transmission control, mainly due to insufficient treatment
     coverage and the limited impact of ivermectin on the adult worm. Vector control is more
     effective for transmission control, while it has also a considerable long term effect on
     blindness.</p>

    <p>The aim of the present study is à better understanding of the host-endopara- site
     relationships in the most widespread Italian ungulate, the wild boar (Sus scrofa).
     Metastrongyles were searched in 47, and gastrointestinal parasites in 57 wild boars shot in
     Central Italy (Forli province). Body weight, dressed weight and total body length of shot boars
     were retorded. The parasite species found, their prevalence and mean intensity were:
     Metastrongylus pudendotectus, 51%, 15; M. Ssalmi, 32%, 8.47; M. confusus, 40%, 5.63; M. apri,
     15%, 1.57% (total metastrongyles, 604%, 62:57); Globocephalus urosubulatus, 87.72%, 27.80;
     Physocephalus sexalatus, 22.81%, 12.23; Trichuris suis, 15.59%, 1.56; Ascaris suum, 1.75%, 1.
     All the parasite frequency distributions did not significantly differ from the Negative
     Binomial (NB) model (Kolmogorov-Smirnov one sample test, P20.05), whilst differed from the
     Poisson model except M. apri and T.</p>
    <p>suis, probably due to low prevalence and mean intensity. A. suum distribution was not tested.
     The monoxenous parasites showed a NB distribution k parameter higher than diheteroxenous ones,
     evidence of a less clumped distribution in the absence of intermediate hosts. The active
     search, either of earthworms by boars or of stoods by coprophagous Coleopteres, could increase
     the numbers of larvae ingested and consequently the clumping of frequency distribution. No
     statistically significant differences were scored in prevalences (chi square test, P20.05) and
     numbers of worms (Mann-Whitney U test, P&gt;0.05) in relation to sex and age. No statistically
     significant correlations (Kendall rank corre- lation coefficient, P&gt;0.05) were found in
     relation to body weight, dressed weight and total body length.</p>

     Saskatchewan, Saskatoon, Canada S7N OWO and Agriculture Canada, Melfort, Canada SOE 1A0
     Gastro-intestinal, Nematodes, Cattle, Epidemiology The epidemiology of gastro-intestinal
     nematodes was studied over a two year period in à 300 cow beef herd in Saskatchewan, Canada.
     Duplicate groups of cows and their calves were maintained through the grazing season (June to
     September or October) on one of three separate grazing management systems: quick (Savory)
     rotation; slow rotation; and continuous grazing (all stocking densities equal). Prevalence,
     "intensity" and genus composition of the nematodes infecting the calves were followed using
     qualitative and quantitative flotations and cultures of fecal samples taken two weekly from the
     calves. Infection patterns were surprisingly similar in all calf groups regardless of the
     grazing system or the year (there was a severe drought in the first year). Calves first had
     eggs in their feces between mid July and mid August. Prevalances peaked between late August and
     mid September, "intensities" (assessed by fecal egg counts) during September. Parasites most
     commonly identified were Nematodirus, Ostertagia, Cooperia and Trichostrongylus. À simple
     mathematical model was used to predict when infective larvae were first present on each paddock
     in the rotational systems. If the cows were the only source of infection for the calves (no
     pasture overwintering of eggs or larvae) the model suggests the slow calves in both years and
     the 1988 quick calves ingested larvae almost continuously from two weeks after the start of the
     grazing season. However, the 1989 quick calves did not ingest larvae until the second grazing
     of their paddocks. This study has demonstrated that neither system of rotational gresitg on the
     Canadian prairies affects the calves’ acquisition of gastro-intestinal nematodes.</p>

     Research Centre, P.0. Box 40063, Upper Hutt, New Zealand Mathematical models, nematodes, sheep
     A simple mathematical model with time-independent parameters is used to describe the life
     cycles of gastro-intestinal nematodes in sheep. The model incorporates the non- linear effects
     of acquired immunity acting on parasite establishment, mortality and fecundity. The model
     displays the usual dynamics: if the basic reproductive rate (PR ) of the parasite population is
     less than one it declines to extinction, whereas if it is greater than one an endemic
     equilibrium state is attained. When the model is complicated by the introduction of
     weather-dependent development and mortality rates for the free-living stages, and

    <p>Développée sur le modèle "Poisson-Plathelminthes parasites", cette base a été conçue de
     manière à ce que chaque individu-parasite d'une infrapopulation soit repéré selon trois
     référendaires : l'espace euclidien, le temps et la composition (toutes les carac- téristiques
     le concernant). La conception même de cette base permet la création automa- tique et immédiate
     de tout sous-ensemble de données (Matrices ...) pouvant étre traité graphiquement où

    <p>Ascaris, Trichuris, polyparasitism, intestinal parasites Individuals in naturally occurring
     host populations typically harbour several parasite species which form interactive communities.
     This study uses field data on human infections to examine the prevalence and age-structured
     intensity of intestinal parasites in single and multiple infections. The incidence of
     polyparasitism is shown to be more frequent than the occurrence of single infections. The most
     prevalent infection type in the present data sets is the Ascaris/Trichuris combination.</p>
    <p>Intensity of infection is seen to be higher in concurrent than in single species infections.
     The higher prevalence and intensity of multiple infections may be due to an interspecific
     synergistic interaction or a statistical consequence of a common faecal-oral infection
     route.</p>

     single mathematical wocel foc the parasitic phase of the comnon trichostrongylid nematode
     parasites of cattle and sheep. À detailed survey and analysis of the literature showed it was
     possible to explain the control and regulation of parasite abundance in terms of three
     processes: an immediate and unpredictable loss of parasites due to failure to exsheathe within
     the first few hours following ingestion; a systematic and quantifiable failure of exsheathed
     parasites to become establishes (a declining sigmoidal function of time); and a systematic and
     quantifiable increase in the mortality of L5 and mature stages that is an asymptotic function
     of parasite burden. What distinguishes one parasite species from the next are the magnitudes of
     its rates of development and mortality. The “mathematical model [PARAGON] is implemented bÿ a
     FORTRAN 77 progran which may be used to devise and assess parasite control strategies.</p>

     Babesiosis, Babesia canis, Seroprevalence, Risk factors, epidemiology An epidemiological survey
     has been conducted in a canine veterinarian practice located in a Babesia canis endemic area in
     order to answer : - what is the seroprevalence ratio in B. canis antibodies in the dogs of this
     area - what in the percentage of asymptomatic dogs presenting positive B. canis blood smears -
     what are the main risk factors of seropositivity.</p>
    <p>Results obtained from 297 dogs, without signs of clinical babesiosis, during april and may
     1988, have shown that 27,6 Z% to 12,3 % from them, depending of their location, had antibodies
     against B. canis. Conflicting results between serological status and previous clinical attack
     of babesiosis have been demonstrated in 25 % of the dogs sampled. No positive blood smear for
     B. canis can be found in the 297 dogs.</p>
    <p>Risk factors influence on seropositivity was studied by statistical method (multiple
     correspondance analysis). Main risk factors identified were walking area (waste ground, cover)
     without any influence of weekly outgoing duration. Dogs race and age cannot be found as risk
     factors nor campaign against ticks by dog owners. The main conclusion of this study is that in
     an endemic area at least one third of the dogs had experienced B. canis infestation.</p>

     temperature and relative humidity. Furthermore, the size of larval olusters is found to be an
     important factor affecting the survival of the larvae: larvae in small clusters do not live for
     as long as larvae in large clusters.</p>

    <p>The data obtained show that glycine, tyrosine, alanine and tryptophane are metabolic
     requirements for the muscle phase larvae of both nematodess However, the uptake of these
     aminoacids varied at different time periods post infection (p.i). It was observed that the
     incorporation of all the tritiated aminoacids as measured by the Beta counter per milligram of
     larval dry weight, were higher for T. spiralis at 2 months post infection than at 6 or 12. The
     lowest uptake was at 12 months pi In the case of T. pseudospiralis, the uptake of all the amino
     acids increased with time. The highest uptake was at 12 months p.i The decrease in the
     incorporation rate of aminoacids into larval protein in the case of T. spiralis at 12 months pi
     is possibly due to the presence of a capsule surrounding the larvae which may act as physical

     among patients with schistosomal hepatic fibrosis (SH), besides, the latter disease being a
     disease with many immunological expressions, the aim of the present work has been to search for
     a possible immunological and metabolic interaction which would mod- ulate atherogenic
     mechanisms. The study has been carried out on 31 patients with SHF and 20 non schisto- somal
     subjects (10 with evident clinical atherosclerosis and 10 without it). All investigated
     subjects were males aged above 40 years; and were subjected to the following : serum
     lipoprotein pattern, total choleste- rol, phospholipids, triglycerides, Apo A, Apo B, IgG, IgM,
     IgA, C3 &amp; circulating immune complexes (CICSs) and passive haemaggutination using $S.
     mansoni adult worm antigens.</p>
    <p>The results showed low levels of blood lipids in patients with SHEF especially in those with
     collaterals (porto-systemic) ; serum levels of IgG and IgM were significantly increased in all
     patients with SHF, while IgA was only increased in patients with collaterals who in turn,
     showed the least incidence of clinically evi- dent atherosclerosis; serum C3 was increased in
     patients with clinical atherosclerosis both schistosomal and non schistosomal. CICs have been
     higher in patients with SHF without atherosclerosis while decreased in atherosclerotic patients
     both schistosomal and non schistosomal. Our results may consolidate the view of protective role
     of liver affection against atherogenesis as well as the important contribution of the immune
     mechanisms in this context.</p>

     treatment 68.0+5,0 U/g. The activity of alkaline phosphatase in faeces before and after the
     treatment was 19.0 U/g and 11.0+7.4 U/g respectively. The activity of alkaline phos- phatase in
     blood Sera before and after the treatment was 8.0+0.4 U/g and 5.1+0.2 U/g respectively. An
     increased excretion with faeces of the mentioned enzymes is the result of imflamatory process
     in the small in- testine. Specific therapy helps to liquidate the pathological process in small
     intestine to normalize biochemical processes and as a consequ- ence to normalise the activity
     of the basis intestinal enzymes in fae- ces. The increase in activity of alkaline phosphatase
     in blood sera of taeniarhynchus patients is probably determined by the functional chan- ges in
     the liver of these patients. Marked changes in the activity of intestinal glands in
     taeniarhynchiasis patients should be noted while using the specific and pathogenic therapy.</p>

     riosis on the acid-base balance and mineral metabolism of calves. Expe- rimental studies were
     carried out in 2 to 3 week old calves inoculated with 3oopoo sporulated oocysts of E.bovis and
     E.zuemii.Several calves were left noninfected as controls. Analytical investigations of blood
     (Na, K, P, and Ca values) were made at intervals from the jugular veins of calves. The
     acid-base balance (pH, P 23 HCO concentration, and base excess) was determined by using miS®6
     Astrdp method. Apparent di- gestibilities and retention of calcium and phosphorus were
     measured. In our experiments decrease in serum sodium, calcium and phosphorus levels in
     inoculated calves was marked. There were no significant changes in the blood serum potassium
     level. The apparent digestibility of calcium and phosphorus was reduced during the acute phase
     of the disease.Meta- bolic acidosis is characterised by the drop in HCO, , the decreased P ,
     base excess, and pH values of the infected cdlves. The data ob- tea suggest that eimeriosis in
     calves is characterised by the dis- durbances of acid-base balance and mineral metabolism.</p>

    <p>Ostertagia ostertagi - acid production Parasitism of the bovine abomasum by the nematode
     Ostertagia ostertagi causes elevated plasma pepsinogen concentrations and an increase in
     abomasal pH. Ostertagi secretions directly stimulate increased production of pepsinogen from
     zymogenic cells and the present study was undertaken to examine the effect that parasite
     secretions had on the production of acid from parietal cells. Cultured abomasal gland
     suspensions were incubated with aminopyrine and parasite secretion or control secretogoques or
     inhibitors. Aminopyrine is a weak base which accumulates in acidic biological compart- ments by
     ion trapping. Parasite secretions did not affect acid production nor did histamine. Dibutyryl
     cAMP** and pentagastrin* significantly increased aminopyrine accumulation by gastric glands and
     cimetidine,** omeprazole** and thiocyanate** significantly decreased aminopyrine
     accumulation.</p>
    <p>The present finding suggests that the elevated abomasal pH observed during O.ostertagi
     infection is not a response to parasite secretions and is therefore probably a reflection of
     the replacement of functional cells with those of reduced activity.</p>

     study. These results suggest that hepatic galactose metabolism is normal in patients with
     moderately severe to severe falciparum malaria despite low liver blood flow (and hence
     galactose delivery) in some patients. Since galactose does not stimulate ïinsulin secretion and
     does not appear to increase plasma lactate concentrations, this simple sugar may be preferable
     to glucose in the treatment of malaria-associated hypoglycaemia.</p>

    <p>Intestinal Helminths, Physcial development, albendazole Helminthic diseases are in developing
     countries a big public health problem, specially in child age. We performed this trial to
     evaluate albendazole efficacy in the treat- ment of the most common intestinal worms in a
     suburban pediatric population in Mexico City. Initially, we performed coproparasitoscopic
     studies, somatometry and selected 500 positive cases (Ascarsis lumbricoides 80%, Trichuris
     Trichiura 20%). The children received albendazole 400 mg and checked again coproparasitoscopic
     reports. Then we started with a dewormed population. Every 4 months the children underwent the
     same procedure. At month 12, the study group was compared with a similar population of the same
     area (500 children) with the same parasitiéal infection.</p>
    <p>The results were vcry favourable for the group treated with great statistical signific- ance
     in somatometry values and obviously coproparasitoscopic tests comparing the control group. Due
     to ethical reasons, it was impossible to maintain a parasited control group. We conclude that
     periodical antihelminthic treatment with albendazole, is of great value to increase physical
     development in populations with high prevalence of helminthic infections.</p>

    <p>Eimeria tenella, lesions, plasma carotene, lipids, proteins The relationship of changes in os
     ji ressentent parameters was determined in 9 day old chickens infected with 10 or 10° oocysts
     of Eimeria tenella. Weight gain, feed consumption and feed conversion were significantly
     depressed at doses of 10 and 10° oocysts/bird. ‘Lesion scores were significantly different
     between all treatments, but a plateauing effect was observed bestarioe at 104 oocysts/bird.
     Plasma carotenoids and lipids were significantly depressed at 10? oocysts/bird and higher,
     while 102 oocysts/ bird and higher significantly ‘depressed plasma protein. PCV was
     significantly depressed at 103 oocysts/bird and higher, with the lowest PCV values for
     survivors on day 6 post infection being obtained at 104 oocysts/bird. Monocyte counts were
     significantly elevated and heterophils were significantly depressed at 10° oocysts/bird. The
     high relationship of the oocysts doses ‘used in this experiment to plasma carotenoids, lipids
     and proteins indicate these measurements could be used successfully to assess the pathogenicity
     of field isolates or the efficacy of anticoccidial drugs.</p>

    <p>Ovine haemonchosis - feed intake - production Two experiments were conducted to measure the
     effects of infection with 350 Haemonchus contortus/ kg bodyweight on the growth and body
     composition of 12-week old Suffolk X Greyface lambs given a high quality pelleted grass/cereal
     diet. In the first experiment lambs offered the diet ad libitum and infected with H. contortus
     became moderately anaemic but the infection had no effect on feed intake, growth rate or body
     composition when compared to uninfected controls. In the second study, feed intakes were
     restricted to approximately 90 and 70% of those recorded in Experiment 1.</p>
    <p>Infection produced à similar degree of anaemia to that seen in the previous study and again
     growth rates were unaffected. However, infection was found to affect body composition and feed
     utilisation, and these effects were more pronounced in the lambs given the lower plane of
     nutrition. These results suggest that the deleterious effects of haemonchosis on production can
     be largely mitigated by high nutrient intake.</p>

     used for an invivo study, in order to find out which is most suitable for the growth and
     development of the S. erinacei. Dogs of RE-Beagl strain were used as host and plerocercoids
     were used to infect the dogs at the rate of 3 larvae per dog. The dogs fed with normal and
     glucose meals were found to be highly infected and the worm extracted from these group of dogs
     had faster and better deve- lopments compared to the others.</p>

     thickness of the seminiferous tubules (ST).</p>
    <p>The affected ST of all 3 species showed degeneration of tubular cells, with qaiant cell
     formation in goats but not in sheep. Except around the areas of calcification, and in the two

     Diagnostic Laboratory System PO Box 1770 Davis, CA,95617 USA Bovine, Abortion, Protozoan,
     Toxoplasma, Neospora Over a period of several years, numerous bovine fetuses submitted to the
     California Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory System had been examined which had a unique
     multifocal necrotizing encephalitis and other histologic changes resembling lesions in
     Toxoplasma-infected ovine fetuses. These bovine fetuses were invariably negative for other
     known pathogens. A 2 year retrospective study was conducted to identify and evaluate all
     fetuses with these histologic changes. Cases included in the study group were defined by the
     presence of a multifocal nonsuppurative encephalitis and a nonsuppurative myocarditis. Fetuses
     with any other etiologic diagnosis were omitted. Of 445 total bovine fetuses submitted, 82
     (18%), representing 56 herds, met the criteria. All but 2 cases were from dairies. In 17 (21%)
     of these cases, clusters of protozoa were found. Multiple abortions were recorded at several
     dairies. There were no salient clinical signs in the aborting cows. Abortions occurred
     year-round. Fetuses ranged from 3 to 9 months gestation, with the majority between 5 and 7
     months gestation. Sarcocystis species was considered the etiology in 2 cases, but the etiology
     in the remaining cases is uncertaïin. Cysts of the unidentified sporozoan were found in the
     brain parenchyma in 10 fetuses, primarily in endothelial cells in 4 fetuses, and in cardiac
     myofibers in 1 fetus. These findings suggest that protozoal fetal infections are a major cause
     for abortion in California dairies.</p>

     Department of Biology, Vrije Universiteit, De Boelelaan 1087, 1018 HV Amsterdam, The
     Netherlands Freshwater snails — Trematodes — Parasitic castration — Schistosomin In this study
     the combination Lymnaea stagnalis-Trichobilharzia ocellata is used as a model system. The
     occurrence of schistosomin, a peptidergic agent, in haemolymph of infected snails, might
     explain reduction or cessation of fecundity in trematode infected snails.Schistosomin appeared
     to be a neuropeptide derived from the CNS of snaïls. The purified peptide inhibits the effects
     of different gonadotropic hormones upon their target organs at the level of the receptor
     complexes. This indicates that only one type of schistosomin is involved. At the moment the
     structure of the molecule is under investigation with recombinant-DNA techniques.</p>
    <p>The presence of schistosomin in haemolymph of infected L. stagnalis has appeared to be a
     general phenomenon in snail species infected with digenetic trematodes, species that are
     intermediate hosts for parasites causing schistosomiasis included. However, schistosomin is
     genus-specific: it has only effect when gonadotropic hormones and schistosomin are derived from
     species belonging to the same genus.</p>
    <p>In a newly developed bioassay it was demonstrated that synthesis and release of schistosomin
     is induced by a humoral factor, which is derived from developing cercariae. Therefore, another
     mechanism might be responsible for the early effects of parasitosis on snail reproduction.</p>

    <p>Praziquantel - Schistosoma mansoni - Biomphalaria - Reproduction The aim of this study was to
     manipulate by use of anthelmintic drugs a Digenean infection of snails to investigate parasitic
     suppression of host reproduction.</p>
    <p>Mature Biomphalaria glabrata with seven week Schistosoma mansoni infections were fed on an
     artificial diet containing praziquantel (Bayer). Snail egg production and cercarial shedding
     were monitored before and for several weeks after drug treatment.</p>
    <p>Snail digestive glands were also fixed for histological examination.</p>
    <p>Praziquantel doses of 20 to 30 mg/kg dramatically reduced the numbers of cercariae shed. In
     the 24 hour period following the return of the snails to a drug-free diet, the numbers of
     cercariae shed typically averagedbetween O0 and 50 compared to control levels of between 1000
     and 1500 cercariae/snail/24 hours. Cercarial shedding was suppressed for several weeks but
     eventually returned to pre-drug levels. The snails used in these experiments, as in other
     studies, stopped egg laying from 5 weeks after infection. Snails with 7 week infections showed
     a temporary resumption of egg laying following 20 to 30 mg/kg doses of anthelmintic. This
     reversal of the usual reproductive curtailment immediately followed cercarial suppression and
     continued until 1 to 2 weeks before shedding resumed.</p>
    <p>Histology of the secondary sporocysts showed the praziquantel acts mainly on the cercariae.
     This implies that reproductive curtailment in snails is related to the later stages of
     cercarial development.</p>

     (cattle, sheep, goats, pigs and their separate organs) by means of complete helminthological
     necropsy in different landscapes of Tashkent oasis. Thirty species of helminhts Were found in
     cattle, thirty three species were found in sheep and five species Were found in pigs, these
     helminths belong to cestodes, trematodes and nematodes. total infection of domestic animals was
     78,6% (cattle - 77,5%, sheep - 86,4%, goats - 79,5%, and pigs - 25,1%).</p>
    <p>There were some changes in invasibility of animals depending on their age. The highest level
     of infection was in adult cattle (50,3%), in young cattle of I - 2 years old it was less
     (45,1%). But younger animals (up to one year old) were not infected significantly.</p>
    <p>Similar phenomena, when rate of animals' infection depends on their age Were ob- served in

     (C) in the periparturient egg rise (PPR) was investeigated using immune ewes previously treated
     with anthelmintic and challenged with O. circumcincta larvae. Ewes were either pregnant and
     challenged for 3 weeks before and 3 weeks after lambing (Experiment 1) or non-pregnant and
     challenged as above around normal lambing time (Experiment 2). In 1, basal plasma P was
     effected by twice daily injection of bromocryptine for 2 weeks starting 2 4 post partum (n =
     10) or for 4 weeks starting 2 weeks prepartum (n = 3). Controls received no bromocryptine (n =
     10). PPR occurred regardless of P levels starting in the second week postpartum. In 2, twice
     daily injection of saline (n = 4) or sufficient C to raise plasma levels to those seen in
     lactating ewes (n = 4) was not followed by a PPR. These results suggest that neither elevated P
     nor C levels are responsible for the PPR. In a third experiment anthelmintic treated pregnant
     ewes were challenged once with 20,000 ©. circumcincta larvae -1, 0 or +1 weeks from lambing. A
     PPR was observed starting 16 d after challenge suggesting that host immunity was already
     impaired 1 week prepartum.</p>

     lice - Children - Drawings One hundred and forty-four drawings by kindergarten children of
     subjects related to head lice were analysed in order to study the emotional reaction of
     children to head lice infestation. The choice of colour in the drawings was significant; black
     was used by 43% of the children, indicatinq that the subject of lice was frequently associated
     with anxiety and fear. This was also apparent in another 23% of the drawings where children
     drew unhappy faces, omitted the mouth or drew faces with tears in the eyes. Out of 92 drawings
     65 (70.7%) showed lice on or around the head of infested children. The remaining 27 (29.3%)
     drew them also on other parts of the body as well as on the clothes which may indicate that
     lice and therefore dirt are part of their self image and that they feel responsible for the
     infestation. Although it is realized today that lice do not differentiate between clean and
     dirty heads,-parents still react negatively to lice infestation and this reaction when
     transfered to the child is reflected in his drawings.</p>

     Endoparasites round and tape worms and ectoparasites such as ticks, mites,lice and fleas are
     posing serious threat to the livestock and pet owners in India and abroad by way of their
     recurrent invasion on young animals and household pets. Various Anthelmintics in use belonging
     to group of modern medicines have been found to be uneconomic, sometimes unsafe and produce
     drug resistance and undesirable residue in products obtained from livestock. Herbal
     anthelmintics in the name of TAENIL, WOPELL (endoparasiticides) and PESTOBAN (ectoparasiticide)
     developed from Indian Herbs collected from natural resources were given a trial on young
     animals naturally infected with such parasites. These drugs were administered to animals (dogs,
     cattie and buffaloes) as per dosing schedule recommended by the manufacturers. Representative
     samples of parasites were collected and preserved for identification before starting the drug
     trial. These herbal preparations were found to be quite safe, economic and effective in
     treatment, prevention and control of such parasitic infestations without producing any
     ill-effect or drug residue in products obtained from these animals.</p>

    <p>Cattle, neonatal, Ostertagia ostertagi, infection rates An experiment was carried out to
     examine establishment and pathogenic effects of Ostertagia ostertagi in neonatal calves with
     special emphasis on the role of the ruminal function for establishment of the infection.</p>
    <p>The experiment included three groups of calves which since birth were fed only with milk
     (group À and C), or with hay and concentrate in addition to milk (group B). Ruminal function
     tests (based on levels of beta hydroxy butyrate and glucose in the plasma) performed at the
     date of infection as well as two weeks before and after infection suggested that the function
     was negligible in group À and C, whereas it was well developed in group B given hay and
     concentrate in addition to milk. On day 30 calves of group A and B were each given 25,000
     normal infective larvae of O. ostertagi and those of group C were given 25,000 infective larvae
     exsheathed in vitro.</p>
    <p>Daily faecal output and post mortem worm counts on day 28 p.i. showed a clear tendency of
     higher rates of worm establishment in calves with significant ruminal function compared with
     calves having only negligible ruminal function. Establishment rates of exsheathed larvae given
     to milk fed calves were lower than those of ensheathed larvae. The experiment indicates a
     possible role of digestive functions for the establishment of 844 S7.C - Parasitisme chez les

    <p>Intestinal helminths, education, Jamaica Aim: Investigation of a possible association between
     intestinal helminth infections (intensity and prevalence) and educational development within
     Jamaican school children.</p>
    <p>Method: Stool samples were collected from over 500 children, of both sexes, aged between 8
     and 11 years of age, randomly selected from three schools in the town of Mandeville, Jamaica
     WI. For each child the number of eggs per gram faeces for each intestinal helminth species
     present in the community was estimated using Kato’s method, from which prevalence and intensity
     estimates were made.</p>
    <p>Results: Over 70% of children were infected with at least one of the two main parasite
     species, Trichuris trichiura and Ascaris lumbricoïdes. The majority of individuals had low
     intensity infections and a minority high intensity. Analysis in relation to school grade
     revealed a significantly higher prevalence and intensity of nematode infections (all species)
     in children of lower grades (regarded as having lower academic ability) than higher grades,
     independent of child age.</p>
    <p>Conclusion: The association between both prevalence and intensity of intestinal helminth
     infections and the way schools grade pupil’s educational ability, which has been demonstrated
     in this study, has, to our knowledge, not previously been reported. The reasons for this
     association, whether a direct effect of parasite infection or due to related factors, has yet
     to be clarified.</p>

     progeny testing and selection has been in progress since 1984 to establish lines of sheep
     expressing high (H) and low (L) faecal worm egg count (FEC) generated from mixed infections
     acquired naturally from pasture. A reference unselected control line (C) has been grazed with
     the selection flock since 1986. Production traits for fleece and liveweights have been
     monitored throughout the project.</p>
    <p>Screening of lambs (born in 1988) at 4-5 months of age showed the mean FEC difference between
     the H and L lines was 1402+332 epg (P&lt;0.001). By 7-8 months this differential was extended
     to 2900+423 epg (P&lt;0.001). Faecal larval cultures indicated that Ostertagia sp. and
     Trichostrongylus sp.were the dominant genera at both sampling times.</p>
    <p>Average liveweight gains between 4 and 8 months for the H and L lines had not diverged with
     the FEC differential, 9.8kg and 9.2kg, respectively. Greasy fleece weights were not
     significantly different at both 4 and 8 month Shearings, 0.69 and 0.74kg; 2.13 and 2.11kg,
     respectively.</p>
    <p>At 8 months of age, 15 ewe lambs (born 1988) from the extremes in the H and L lines were
     drenched with anthelmintic, housed and dosed with approximately 5000 L; larvae
     (3/7:Haemonchus/Trichostrongylus) to examine relative susceptibilities. Lambs from the L line
     harboured approximately 1700 (31%) fewer worms and shed 3400 (45%) fewer eggs than their H line
     counterparts (P&lt;0.01). Significantly fewer Trichostrongylus were recovered from the lambs
     selected for low FEC, 3200 versus 4793 (P &lt;0.01).</p>
    <p>Resistance or susceptibility to one species of parasite has been demonstrated 4 years after
     genetic selection for high or low FEC was initiated in grazing lambs.</p>

    <p>We infected experimentally 44 dogs, free of invasion, with protoxolexes of echinococcus cysts
     from liver of 6-aged ass, wich was from the labo- reatory of rabies. Making a post-mortem
     examination we discovered the li- ver full of parasite cysts. The size of cysts was 5-12 sm and
     they were full of protoscolexes. The slaughter of dogs was on the 7, 15, 2I, 28, 35, 42, 49,
     56, 63,70,77,85,92 days after invasion. In all cases we dis- covered echinococcus in the stage
     of development. At the same time with "ass" strain we studied the development of "'sheep'"'
     strain of echinococ- cosis in dogs. The chamber processing of "ass" and ‘’sheep" strains show-
     ed, that ass'echinococcus in dog's intestine were fully developed by 92 day and "sheep'"'
     strain - 45 day. So, the development of "ass" strain of echinococcus in definitive host was
     more slowly than "“sheep" strain and the full formation of parasite was 47 days later.</p>

    <p>Coenurosis - treatment and prophylaxis Chemoprophylaxis is a new way of prophylaxis of the
     larval taeniadosis (echinococcosis, coenurosis) and cysticercosis of animals. This method
     prevents animals from the invasion with coenurosis and echinococcosis and is carried out by
     regular giving of antihelminthics. We used Pana- cur, chlorofos and Droncit for the
     chemoprophylaxis of sheep coenurosis.</p>
    <p>Panacur,oral administered in dose of 0,5-I,0 8 in granules (III and 222 mg active agent) for
     one sheep using 6 times,prevented the lambs from coenurosis invasion. The first 3 processings
     were carried out at inter- val of 15-20 days and another 3 processings - at interval of 30-45
     days.</p>
    <p>Chlorophos also prevented the animals from the coenurosis' invasion given in doses of 60-80
     mg/kg of body/weight in 0,5-I1,0% water solution and used 6 times. The first 3
     dehelminthizations were carried out individu- ally per os at interval of 15-20 days, another 3
     dehelminthizations - by free drinking of chlorophos in 1% water solution at interval of 30-45

     infected with Muellerius capillaris were treated with anthelmintics in pens in controlled
     tests. Seven to 12 weeks later they were killed; lungs were examined for the presence of worms,
     eggs and larvae. Faecal larval counts were also made regularly. Alphaoxfendazole at 5.5 or 8.25
     mg/kg daily for 3 days or 8.25 mg/kg single dose reduced larval output by &gt;90 % but failed
     to eliminate the worms. One dose of 27.5 mg/kg killed the worms in 2 goats and low infection
     remained in 2. Larval output was reduced for 4 weeks in goats treated with above dose in the
     field but returned to previous level later. Single dose of ivermectin at 0.2 or 0.4 mg/kg
     reduced larval excretion but returned to pre-treatment level 44 days after treatment.
     Ivermectin at 0.4 mg/kg combined with alphaoxfendazole at 8.25 mg/kg was as effective as
     alphaoxfendazole alone.</p>
    <p>Luxabendazole at a single dose of 30 mg/kg eliminated the worms in 3 of 4 goats; few larvae
     were found in the lungs of the th. Albendazole at a single dose of 30 mg/kg failed to reduce
     infection. When the drug was given in a slow release capsule (Captec bolus) a daily release of
     2.4 mg/kg or 1.2 mg/kg for 100 days eliminated the infection in all goats.</p>
    <p>Some benzimidazole drugs at elevated doses may reduce Muellerius capillaris infection in

     trial period. Bv day 52 pd., reductions in fec. compared with pre-dosing counts in the pyrantel
     treated groups were not statisticallv significant, but clearance in the ivermectin dosed
     animals was better than 99 per cent. After 104 days, fec. reductions were still considerable in
     the ivermectin treated groups but were no longer statistically significant.</p>

     were detected in faecal samples.</p>
    <p>The ability of ivermectin to maintain negligible or low fec. for many weeks is due to

    <p>European eel- pseudodactylogyrosis- treatment At least 24-hour exposure to a mebendazole
     solution of 1 mg/l con- centration is an efficacious treatment against monogenean infestation
     of intensively cultured eel (Székelyÿy and Molnér, 1987, Buchmann and Bjerre- gaard, 1989). To
     avoid the selection of mebendazole-resistant parasites, in this experiment we tested the
     efficacy of long (24-hour) exposures to anthelmintics chemically different from
     mebendazole.</p>
    <p>Of the anthelmintics tested, niclosamide at a concentration of 1 mg/1 was efficacious but
     toxic to the fish. Phenolsulphonphtalein was without effect even at a high dose (100 mg/l).
     Toltrazuril solutions of 1 and 10 mg/1 concentration were also ineffective while that of 20
     mg/l concentration was already toxic. Rafoxanide and bunamidine weré toxic to eels already at a
     low concentration (1 mg/1). Levamisole, when used at its still untoxic concentration (10 mg/l)
     was without effect on parasi- tes. Of the drugs tested, only praziquantel (10 mg/l) proved to
     be effi- cacious, with 100% efficacy both the prevalence and the intensity of in- festation.
     However, because of its high price at present praziquantel cannot be considered a possible
     candidate for replacing mebendazole.</p>

     that the above mentioned combination of drugs is relatively safe and pratically exempt of
     adverse effects. Then the toxicological tests were conducted with bovines and no significant
     changes occurred in haematological and biochemical parameters: complete haemograms, GOT, GPT,
     cholinesterase, urea, creatinine.</p>
    <p>The anthelminticefficacy of the 'FMCO2BR' was tested in a groupof l4 naturally infected
     calves harboring 9 (nine) nematodes and 1 cestode species. Sevenof these calves were at random
     separated for treatment with the medicament mixture and the other 7 were given a placebo and
     observed as controls. The evaluation of results was based on helminth identification and
     counting in individual animals slaughtered 7 days after treatment. Such results showed for the
     treatment an efficacy class A (&gt;90%) against 7 of the 9 nematode species present in the
     hosts and an efficacy class B for one: class A: Haemonchus contortus,H.similis, Cooperia
     punctata, C.pectinata, Oesophagostomum radiatum,Trichuris discolor and Dictyocaulus
     viviparus.Class B: Bunostomum phlebotomum. No effect was found either against Trichostrongylus
     axei or Moniezia benedeni. The average nematode count in calves was around 55 as high as in the
     treated ones.</p>

     Psoroptes mange mites, on pigs against Haematopinus suis and Sarcoptes suis as well as on dogs
     against ticks. Fly control was tried on grazing and housed cattle. Treatments were conducted
     with water solutions of the concentrate at rates of 0.25 and 0.5 %.</p>
    <p>Against Psoroptic mange sheep were dipped,cattle were sprayed and rabbits were treated
     topically twice, at an interval of 7 days. These treatments resulted in 100 % efficacy. In pigs
     spraying was repeated after 14 days. As a result, pigs became free from sucking lice for at
     least 28 days, however, this treat- ment had only partial effect against Sarcoptes suis. In
     dogs washing made killer effect on ticks in one hour and repellent effect remained for only 3
     days.</p>
    <p>After cattle spraying "knock down" effect appeared immediately on Musca domes- tica, Stomoxys

    <p>Strongilids - Dairy cows - Albendazole - N.W. Spain The effects of treatment against
     gastrointestinal nematodes on the narasitism, live weight and milk production of early calving
     heifers and on grass contamination have been studied. 36 early lactation Freisian heifers, with
     grouped calving, naturally infested with strongilids, were divided, before calving, into two
     groups of equal size: G-T (treated with albendazole-7.5 mg/Kg 1.W.) and G-C (untreated). Both
     groups were. rotationally grazed on paddocks which in the previous year had been grazed by
     another herd with similar treatment. During 1989, samples of faeces and blood were taken
     monthly to determine number of eggs per gram (e.p.g.) and serum pepsinogen levels.</p>
    <p>Before the animals entered the paddocks a count of the number of 3rd stage larvae per
     Kilogramme dry mater (L-3/Kg D.M.) in the grass was made.</p>
    <p>Before calving, the average e.p.g. was 20.3 and then it increased to 56.5. The average e.p.g.
     values ïin the later sampling of the calving were 10.3 for the G-T and 25.9 for the G-C. The
     average number of L-3/Kg D.M. was 113.6 in the G-C paddocks and 56.9 in those of the G-T
     treatment. Both had a maximum in the March-April period.</p>
    <p>The larvae of Trichostrongylus, Cooperia, Ostertagia and Oesophagostomum were identi- fied in
     the plots and in the faeces.</p>
    <p>From a variance analysis on both groups of animals, significant differences with regard to
     e.p.g. (p&lt;0.001), the levels of serum pepsinogen (p&lt;0.05) were found, while there were no
     significant differences for the contaminations of grass by L-3 (p&lt;0.1), though this one was
     higher in G-C paddocks. The miik yield and the live weight gain were slightly higher in the G-T
     animals; however, this difference was not significantly different from that of the G-C
     animals.</p>

     respectively against 4.5, 11, and 28 day-old P equorum larvae. Adverse reactions do to
     treatment were not observed. Routine use of ivermectin in horses starting at a young age should
     enhance control of P equorum as compared to other single treatment anthelmintic regimes.</p>

     endoparasites, and a component of the new preparation of Chinoin, Vermitan Plus paste. À total
     of 119 Nonius, Gidran, Hungarian half-blood, Mezôhegyes half-blood, and Shetland pony stud
     horses were examined by this antiparasitic preparation. In the 3 experimental studs the
     severity of natural infection by Gasterophilus larvae wag unknown. Target animal safety test
     for ex- perimental animals completed with a Vermitan Plus paste preparation (cont.: albendazole
     and "transmix"). During the experiments for 4 horses were given orally the therapeutical dose
     (10 mg albendazole/kg b.m., and 1.5 mg "transmix"/kg b.m.), 4 horses were treated once with 3
     times the therapeutic dose and for 2 horses were given once with 5 times the therapeutic dose.
     During the baseline period, under and after treatment detailed physical examination, clinical
     observation and serobiochemical examination were carried out.During the experiments of the
     efficacy of preparation we treated 99 horses which had natural infection with Gasterophilus
     larvae, and 10 horses naturally infected with chewing louse (Werneckiella equi equi). For the
     positive control groups used preparation Rintal Plus paste (Bayer) in the therapeutical dose
     (8.4 g paste/100 kg b.m.). After treatment 5061 spontaneously excreted faecal samples were
     examined for the presence of Gasterophilus larvae at 2-h intervals for 3 days. For the
     demonstration of intensity of the larva- -emptyness-by preparation calculated the relative
     frequency value and we used the method of multiple regression analysis. On the basis of our
     experiments it can be ascertained that Vermitan Plus paste is a safe drug with a low toxicity
     for horses giving in therap- eutical doses what is more threefold and five times HAgTEE doses
     do not show detectable toxic effect, and by efficacy this preparation comparable to Rintal Plus

     infestation of sheep after 20 years following the introduction of the control rogram against
     gastro intestinal nematodes in sheep in Poland. Studies were carried uE for 5 years (1985-89)
     in two groups of sheep: ewe-lambs and ram-lambs untreated during the experiment period. While
     comparing the infestation of sheep housed and pasture-grazed in an annual cycle as well as
     rotationally grazed and under extensive pasture System the Iower infestation in the housed and
     rotationally grazed sheep was observed. t' is exemplified as follows: in May - à month of
     highest infestation, the incidence in ram- lambs housed was 58% lower than in those
     pasture-grazed and in ewe-lamds 52%. EPG was S7% and S6% respectively. The incidence of
     infestation in ram-lambs rotationally grazed was 48% lower than in those under extensive
     pasture system while in ewe-lambs- 44%. EFG was 57% and 50% respectively, The effect of various
     drugs and time of treatment on the infestation also was observed, After treatment in May and
     PUqUES with Nilverm and Fenbesan only very slight differences in efficacy of these
     anthefmintics were found. If treatment Éook place in November and May bettr results were
     obtained with Fenbesan. The incidence of infestation decreased_ in ewe-lambs by 80.8% and in
     ram-lambs by 84.74 while after Nilverm 48.4% and S6.6% respectively. EPFG was 84,4%, 88.1% and
     49.4%, 59,9% respectively. The above results wil be utilized to modernize a control program

     Ancylostoma - Dog - Anthelmintic Synergism between two anthelmintics, febantel and pyrantel
     embonate, was evaluated in canine intestinal nematode infections. First, efficacy of febantel
     alone was determined against Trichuris vulpis, Toxocara canis, and Ancylostoma caninum in dogs.
     Oral administrations of 15 mg/kg for 3 successive days and à single administration of 45 mg/kg
     of the drug com- pletely eliminated these 3 species of nematodes. Secondly, efficacy of
     pyrantel embonate alone was determined against the same species of nema- todes. Administrations
     of 14.4 mg/kg for 2 - 3 successive days and a sin- gle administration of 28.8 - 43.2 mg/kg of
     the drug completely eliminated T. canis and A. caninum, but could not eliminate T. vulpis.
     Thirdly, com- bined treatment with febantel and pyrantel embonate was completely effica- cious
     against all the 3 species in a single administration of 15 mg/kg and 14.4 mg/kg, respectively.
     Consequently, the combined treatment could re- duce the drug doses or administration times.
     Clinical application of this combined formulation proved its satisfactory efficacy in 50 dogs
     each with T. vulpis, T. canis, and À. caninum infections. In addition, a safety evaluation
     study assured that the formulation developed no severe adverse effects in dogs even if orally

    <p>EVALUATION OF CHEMOTHERAPY IN HYDATID DISEASE. ANALYSIS OF TREATMENT BY ULTRASCONOGRAPHY LL.
     Gustavson Moringlane - and À. Aus-Kettis | Dept of Infectious Diseases - Karolinska Institute ,
     Roslagstull Hospital - Stockholm, Sweden An increasing amount of imported cases of human
     hydatid disease are seen during the last few years in Sweden and mainly in immigrants from
     Southern Europe and the Middle East.Thirty cases of liver hydatid disease were diagnosed in the
     Department of Tropical Disease, Roslagstu]] hospital January 1980-January 1990.</p>
    <p>Chemotherapy was given as benzimidozalcarbamates (mebendazol, albenzadol). Twelve patients
     héd mebendazol. Four had mebendazol and albendazol while 9 patients had albendazol only. In 20
     patients, chernother apy was followed by surgical intervention. All pâtients were followed by
     ultrasonography during the complete course of treatment and the results thus analyzed and
     evaluated. Ultrasonogr aphy revealed à gradual decrease in hydatid cyst sizes. Changes in
     echogenicity indicating degener ation as well as detachment of cyst membranes. Serelogical
     tests were per formed dur ing the treatment.</p>
    <p>The results showed decrease of antibody titers during treatment in some of the cases although
     no marked ser ological response could be observed until at least one year after surgery.</p>
    <p>Ultrasonography appears to be a simple and reliable diagnostic method in human hydatid
     disease and the effect of chemotherapy can be also evaluated.</p>
    <p>Surgery seems however to be the treatment of choice.Preoperative chemotherapy might reduce
     the risk for allergic reactions or possible recurrent infection induced of surgical

    <p>Hypersensitivity to Sarcoptes mange mites is recognized as a cause of dermatitis in pigs.</p>
    <p>Economic losses from dermatitis result when carcasses have to be trimmed.Investigations were
     conducted On two farms,one with a history of carcass trimming due to the presence of dermatitis
     and one without previous history of trimming.At each farm,80 pigs were used to determine the
     prevalence of Sarcoptes infections at the start of the fattening period and the prevalence of
     Sarcoptes and dermatitis at the time of slaughter following treatment with ivermectin injection
     (300 mcg/kg) or no treatment for ectoparasites (levamisole was given for internal parasite
     control).</p>
    <p>Sarcoptes mites were not observed in ear scrapings from pigs at the farm with no history of
     carcass trimming,either at the start of the fattening period or at slaughter.On the other
     farm,Sarcoptes mites were present in scrapings from a few pigs at the start of the fattening
     period.At slaughter,scrapings from 50% of the control group were positive for mites,while only
     one sample from an ivermectine treated pig was positive.On this farm the prevalence of
     dermatitis at slaughter was lower in the ivermectin group than in the con- trol group.It was
     determined that,on a mange- and dermatitis-positive farm,the prevalence of sarcoptic mange and
     dermatitis was reduced among pigs treated with ivermectin at the start of the fattening
     period,as compared to untreated controls.</p>

    <p>Natural variations in mite population densities may mask the true efficacy of chemicals
     claimed to control itchmite (Psorergates ovis Womersley). Mite numbers tend to decrease between
     summer and winter, with a slight increase in the autumn and a significant increase in late
     winter and spring. Five commercial dips: amitraz (125ppm) plus diazinon (100ppm), arsenic
     (1,500ppm) plus rotenone (12.6ppm), cypermethrin (19ppm) plus rotenone (75.6ppm), cypermethrin
     alone (19ppm), rotenone alone (75.6ppm) and two dose regimens of ivermectin drench: a single
     dose (.02 mg/kg) or 2 doses (each .02 mg/kg) 28 days apart; were evaluated for efficacy against
     mite infestations in groups of 5 sheep after spring or autumn treatment. Untreated control
     sheep were also monitored. The efficacy of the compounds varied considerably according to the
     season in which they were used. Ivermectin given in the spring effectively reduced itchmite
     numbers to a low level with limited recovery, but gave poor control of P. ovis when
     administered in the autumn. Of the dips tested, those containing rotenone (75.6ppm) caused the
     greatest reduction in mite numbers. Recovery of the mite population occurred in all cases after
     autumn dipping but spring dipping with rotenone or cypermethrin plus rotenone reduced mite
     numbers to an undetectable level in all treated sheep at 7 days post-treatment with no recovery
     of the population in the following spring.</p>

    <p>Isometamidium in pigs Isometamidium has been claimed to be effective in controlling clinical
     outbreaks and protecting pigs against Trypanosoma simiae for up to fiye months. The doses that
     have been considered effective range from 12.5 to 35.1 mgkg given intramusçularly. These are
     considerably higher than the standard recommended dose of 0.5 mgkg for other animal species and
     the present study examines the pharmacokinetics and adverse effects of isometamidium in pigs
     following intramuscular and intravenous administration. Li Following intramuscular
     administration of the drug at doses of 0.5, 15 and 35 mgkg the drug was rapidly absorbed within
     15 to 30 minutes to reach maximum plasma concen- trations of 12 to 477 (n=6), 302 to 655 (n=4)

     terminal phase ,were 7.12 hours for the pigs given 15 mgkg and 7.20 hours for the pig given 35
     mgkg . At all intramuscular injection sites, high drug concentrations were found six weeks
     after administration.</p>
    <p>Acute adverse reactions occurred in one pig given 35 mgkg” 1 intramuscularly and two pigs
     given 2 mgkg intravenously which died. Significant increases in plasma gamma
     glutamyltransferase and alanine aminotransferase following drug administration suggest
     hepatobiliary damage. The present findings indicate that pigs, like most other animal species,
     are susceptible to the toxic effects of isometamidium and that the high doses that have been
     recommended against T.simiae are too toxic to be acceptable for routine use.</p>

     TERM LOW LEVEL ADMINISTRATION M.R.Knox, D.N. Ali, L.F, Le Jambre, J.W. Steel. CSIRO Division of
     Animal Health, Pastoral Research Laboratory, Armidale, NSW 2350, Australia Sheep, goat,
     fenbendazole, continual dose Significant differences in anthelmintic pharmacokinetics have been
     demonstrated between goats and sheep when single dose therapy is applied. Recent advances in
     anthelmintic application technology have included strategies which deliver low doses of
     anthelmintic over an extended period. The use of long term low level doses of fenbendazole has
     been shown to be an effective means of controlling parasites in cattle and sheep. The present
     experiment compares the plasma levels of fenbendazole and its metabolites in goats and sheep
     after long term low level administration. Six goats and six sheep were fed a molasses-urea feed
     suppiement block containing 0.5g/kg fenbendazole and individual consumptions monitored daily.
     Plasma was collected from each animal each 3 days for HPLC analysis of fenbendazole
     metabolites. A significant difference (P&lt;0.01) between sheep and goats was observed when
     plasma metabolite levels were plotted against block consumption. The slope of the model
     describing this relationship for sheep was much higher (X5) than that for goats. The effects of
     this finding on possible utilization of this anthelmintic application strategy will be
     discussed.</p>

     51-148 Wroctaw, Poland Poultry lice control - Butox - Pyrethroid preparation - Mallophaga
     Laboratory studies and on birds EE gallus dom.) were conducted to determine the efficacy of
     Butox (pyrethroid preparation) against poultry lice Menopon gallinae and Eomenacanthus
     stramineus. Under laboratory con- ditions Butox was applied in cencentrations of 10, 50, 100
     and 200 ppm by the method of direct and indirect contact with insects in Petri dishes, Each
     dose of preparation was tested on 10 parasites in 3 replications and each series of the
     experiment was repeated. Both mallophagan species treated by immersion even in solution of the
     lowest dose were killed on the spot immediately, whereas indirect treatment on saturated filter
     paper resulted in 50% mortality during one hour. Butox efficacy was the highest comparing with
     that obtained in simultanously tested other pyrethpoïd preparation (Stomoxin) and
     phosphoroorganic (Neguvon and Polwet).</p>
    <p>Experiments in vivo were carried out on 49 eight week old broilers, arti- ficially infested
     with Menopon gallinae. The infestation rate in each bird was about 20 visible insects counted
     after feathers exposure. Severely in- fested birds were divided into 7 groups; one of them (7
     broilers) was the control. Each bird in 6 treated groups was sprayed with 10 ml of Butox in the
     concentration of 200, 100, 50, 25, 12 and 6 ppm, respectively. The doses of 200-25 ppm caused
     100% mortality during one day. However, after application of 12 and 6 ppm,single specimens were
     found during next few days. After 20 days neither adults nor nymphs were found on the birds,
     One treatment at lowest dose was sufficient to protect from reinfestation.</p>

     months for 12 months ("Strategic" Program) with RM 340 was found to be useful in monitoring the
     acquisition of infection and predicting the effectiveness of treatment. This study was
     complementary to a study on chemoprophylaxis by seasonal injection, which was conducted in GA,
     FL, and LA. The data presented here is from 2 groups (1 treated, 1 control) of 5 dogs each
     which were placed under field conditions from April 1988 to April 1989 at each of the 3
     sites.</p>
    <p>The treated dogs were given 2 deep IM (lumbar) injections of RM 340 at 2.2 mg/kg 3 hr apart
     beginning in August 1988. All dogs were bled for collection of serum and examined for
     microfilariae prior to exposure, at 4-month intervals during exposure, and again at necropsy 5
     months after the exposure period. In regard to the 14 (total) control dogs at the 3 sites, 1 of
     4 from GA and 1 of 5 from FL had positive reactions (weak) as early as August 1988, but none of
     the control dogs from LA had antigen until December 1988, when 2 of the 5 were positive. In
     general, antigen levels and percentages of antigen-positive dogs increased with time in the
     control groups. At necropsy, 13 of the 14 control dogs had heartworms and were
     antigen-positive. Antigen was detected on at least one occasion in only 1 of the treated dogs
     from LA, 1 from FL, and 2 from GA, but at necropsy, only 1 of the treated dogs (GA) was
     positive and it had a single live female worm. A similar pattern was seen with the CITE®

     highly endemic area where the incidence rate of Gnathostoma hispidum was 34.9% in domestic
     pigs.10 species of fresh-water cyclops were experimen- tally proved as the first intermediate

     appeared to be the new host records from the world. There were 939 fresh-water fishes belong to
     13 families,30 genera and 33 species examined,and 14 of them found to be naturally infected
     with the 3rd-stage larvae of G.hispidum.In addition, 5 species of vertebrates such as Rana

     Fascioloides magna is found in the liver parenchyma of Odocoileus virginianus and other
     artiodactyles. It is an important parasite of cattle in endemic areas. In theory, the parasite
     could be controlled by treating free ranging deer to reduce pasture contamin- ation by parasite
     eggs. Triclabendazole is highly effective in treating F. magna infections in white-tailed deer.
     A pilot field trial was conducted using triclabenda- zole medicated corn bait (500 mg per 45 kg
     of corn) on three pastures (treated,baited control and unbaited control) in 1987, 1988 and
     1989. medicated bait was offered for 6 weeks, and use of the bait was observed during daily
     surveys. A sample of deer were examined for the parasite before the start of the study and each
     year after the baiting was completed. Five of 13 fawns were infected at the start of the study,
     showing the transmission of the parasite was occuring. In 1987, of 8 deer examined in the
     treated pasture, 7 were infected, and 6 had dead parasites. Seven of 9 were infected in the
     baited control and 11 of 15 were infected in the unbaited control. In 1988, 4 of 9 deer in
     treatment pasture were infected, all had dead parasites, while 7 of 9 were infected in baited
     control and 8 of 9 were infected in unbaited control. In 1989, 2 of 6 deer were infected in the
     treated pastures, one had live parasites. One of 6 and 5 of 6 deer were infected in the baited
     and unbaited controls. All infected deer from the baited and unbaïted controls had live
     parasites. This study indicates that free ranging deer can be treated successfully for F. magna
     by the use of medicated bait. The effects of the treatment on the transmission of the parasite
     was monitored by grazing sentinel calves on the baited pastures. Transmission of the parasite
     was observed during the first half of 1987, but because of a drought, transmission has not
     occured since then.</p>

     conducted to check toxi- city and effectiveness of APITOL Ciba-Geigy preparation (Cymiazoli
     hydrochloricum) in combating V. jacobsoni in bees.</p>
    <p>Bees from experimental groups were given after 0 and 2 days 2 ml of su- gar syrup with
     following contents: group I - 50 mg APITOL in 20 ml (8,75 mg cymiazoli hydrochloricum = a.i.),
     II - 100 mg (17,5 mg a.i.), III - 200 mg (35 mg a.i.) and 400 mg (70 mg a.i.). Bees the control
     groups received only syrup.</p>
    <p>Toxicity and effeciveness evaluation of APITOL was conducted after 2, 6, 24, 48 and 72 hours.
     APITOL in a dose of 200 mg and 400 mg caused 12-14% of bee mortality, and at lover doses, per
     cent of dead bees was dose to that in a control group. The medicine efectiveness in the dose of
     50 mg was 83% and 100% in increased doses. The highest morality of a V. jacobsoni was after 24
     hours.</p>
    <p>Field experiments were conducted in August and September on 18 bee fa- milies at the presence
     of brood in them. APITOL in 2 g dose per family was given in 500 ml sugar syrüp (group I) and
     twice in 7 days-interval (group II).</p>
    <p>Efficency of a single treatment was 83% and double one 87%. APITOL is a safe medicine for
     bees and brood, easy to give and highly effecti- ve in combating varroa disease.</p>

    <p>Respiratory rate, body temperature and number of larvae in faeces were recorded daily and
     blood pO, and pCO,, interpleural pressure and differential cell counts of lung fluid were
     tested twice a week. High dose infected animals showed considerable clinical signs.
     Interpleural pressure decreased while respiratory rates increased.</p>
    <p>Thus blood pO, decreased only slightly. Differential cell counts revealed that due to severe
     inflammatory reactions in lung tissue neutrophil granulocytes became the predominant cell type.
     The percentage of eosinophil granulocytes increased considerably. Low percentages of mast cells
     were seen at the same time indicating allergic phenomena. Low dose infected animals showed only
     mild clinical signs that on pasture probably would have escaped the farmer'’s notice. However
     the parameters investigated showed considerable changes and high total numbers of larvae in the
     faeces would have contributed to increased pasture contamination.</p>

     Ivermectin To determine if three treatments of ivermectin paste, one at the time of turnout to
     pasture in the spring, one two months later and one in late fall at the end of the pasture
     season, are useful for the control of strongyles. In late spring 1989, 21 year- lings,
     naturally infected with strongyles and without previous anthelmintic treatment, were allocated
     to two treatment groups. One group was treated orally with ivermectin at 200ug/kg body weight
     on May 12, July 7 and November 7. On May 15, each group of ponies was placed on a separate
     pasture and were kept there until November 7 when they were housed overwinter. A fecal sample
     from each pony was examined for strongyle eggs prior to the first treatment and every two weeks
     until April 1990. Every two weeks from May to mid-November herbage samples from each pasture
     were examined for strongyle larvae.</p>
    <p>Prior to treatment, the mean fecal strongyle egg count (epg) in both groups were similar and
     above 1000. The mean epg for untreated ponies rose to 2772 on August 14 and then declined
     gradually through the remainder of the period. The mean epg for treated ponies was at zero or
     close to it during the pasture period except from mid-September onwards when it rose to 355
     before treatment in November. After treatment, significant egg counts were not seen until
     mid-January 1990. Herbage larval counts rose to 35,000 larvae/kg dry herbage during
     August-September on the pasture with untreated ponies and then declined. Few larvae were found
     on the pasture with treated ponies. The three- treatment strategy appeared useful in
     significantly reducing transmission of strongyles in yearlings.</p>

     Since 1981 cattle grazing in tsetse-infested areas on Galana Ranch in the Coast Province of
     Kenya have been protected from trypanosome infection generally for six or more weeks by means
     of strategic dosing with isometamidium chloride. During the latter part of 1987 infections with
     Trypanosoma vivax were detected within three to four weeks of isometamidium treatment. In one
     area, despite repeated treatment over 25% of the cattle (1,232 animals) died but post mortem
     examination did not indicate trypanosomiasis as the cause of death.</p>
    <p>In the following year an exceptionally high incidence of infection was recorded and T. vivax
     was found in cattle two to three weeks after treatment with either isometamidium chloride or
     homidium bromide. High mortality rates were observed in cattle which received frequent dosing
     with isometamidium chloride and diminazene aceturate. Post mortem findings were similar to
     those in the previous year and drug toxicity is thought to be the probable cause of most of the

    <p>POTENTIATION OF IONOPHOROUS ANTICOCCIDIALS WITH ANTIOXIDANT DUOKVIN I.Varga. Department of
     Parasitology and Zool99y, University of Veterinary Science, Budapest, Pf. 2., 1400, Hungary
     Tlonophorous anticoccidials - Antioxidant - Chicken - Duokvin The earlier recognized toxic
     interaction between several ionophorous anti- coccidials and the antioxidant XAX-M resulted in
     decreased weight gain of chickens and simultaneous increase of anticoccidial action in battery
     tests.</p>
    <p>Halving the dose of anticoccidials eliminated the adverse effects of toxic interaction, while
     anticoccidial efficacy characteristic of the original dosage remained unchanged. The purpose of
     the present study was to find out whether or not any interaction between some ionophorous
     anticoccidials and a new antioxidant Duokvin exists. Battery tests were carried out on a total
     of 760 wingtagged Hybro cockerels which were infected at the age of 7 days with suspensions of
     oocysts consisting of Eimeria tenella and E. mitis and the survivors were killed 8 days later.
     Groups of chickens were fed on diets containing either monensin at 100 mg, 50 mg, 25 mg, 12,5
     mg, 6,3 mg or supplemented uniformly with Duokvin at 120 mg/kg of feed. Other groups of
     chickens were receiving salinomycin similarly decreasing in the range of 60 to 3,8 mg/kg alone
     or added Duokvin at 120 mg/kg of feed. Parameters to measure the anticoccidial efficacy were as
     follows: mortality, weight gain faecal scores, oocyst production macroscopic lesions in the
     caeca and presence of côccidia in the mucosal scrapings. Although Duokvin itself has no
     appreciable anticoccidial activity, mixed to the feed at 120 mg/kg enables the recudtion of
     both monensin and salinomycin to approx, 12 % of the recommended dose levels without any loss
     of efficacy.</p>

     Maduramicin, Amprolium, Efficacy, Turkey, Coccidiosis Four floor pen studies were conducted in
     the U.S. to compare anticoccidial efficacies of CYGRO® maduramicin with amprolium at their
     respective dietary use levels in growing turkeys. In each study, day-old turkey poults were
     randomly distributed to three treatment groups. Group I served as the infected, nonmedicated
     control, Group II received maduramicin at 5 ppm, and Group III was fed amprolium at 125 ppm
     from 1 day to 56 days of age. Coccidial infections were administered in feed with mixed species
     of Eimeria adenoeïdes, E. dispersa, E. gallopavonis, and E. meleagrimitis oocysts at 21 days of
     age. At 8 weeks of age, Group II (maduramicin) weighed 2571 g per bird, which was significantly
     (P&lt;0.05) heavier than Group I (control - 2381 g) and Group III (amprolium - 2488 g). Both
     maduramicin and amprolium significantly improved feed efficiency and completely eliminated
     mortality due to coccidiosis. Two birds from each replicate pen were placed in a battery
     compartment and fed nonmedicated feeds from 8 to 10 weeks of age. These birds were challenged
     with mixed oocysts at 9 weeks of age to assess their development of immunity. Maduramicin
     allowed better development of immunity as demonstrated by the weight gain (493 g), which was
     significantly greater than the amprolium group (399 g) and comparable to the infected control
     (545 g) group.</p>
    <p>It is concluded that maduramicin provided better protection than did amprolium against
     coccidiosis during the growing period, and at the same time allowed development of solid
     immunity against subsequent coccidial challenge during the nonmedicated period.</p>

     coccidiosis continues to represent a serious problem for husbandry of poultry under intensive
     conditions. Yet, the efficacy of polyether ionophores, used as prophy- lactic coccidiostats,
     has been repeatedly demonstrated against either pure cultures of various Eimeria species or
     mixed coccidia from field isolates. Since in practice the chicks are continuously exposed to
     infectious parasites,the effects of repeated inocula- tions with two frequent coccidia species
     were investigated. Chicks, on a commercial diet supplemented with the anticoccidials lasalocid
     (125 ppm), monensin (120 ppm) or salino- mycin (60 ppm), were inoculated once (day 15) or twice
     (days 15/18) with 200’000 sporu- lated oocysts of either E.acervulina (E.A) or E.tenella (E.T)
     according to the follow- ing scheme: AC=single infection with E.A; AC/AC-double infection with
     E.A; AC/TE-double infection vith E.A followed by E.T; TE-single infection with E.T. On day 25,
     the chicks vere sacrificed and performance (weight gain,feed conversion), lesion scores in
     duodenum (LSD) and ceca (LSC) as well as oocyst excretion were determined. Judged by
     performance of the infected unmedicated chicks the pathogenicity of the double infections was
     stron- ger than that of both single inoculations. In contrast lesion scores in the duodenum (AC
     &gt;AC/TE&gt;AC/AC) and the ceca (TE&gt;AC/TE) were higher with the single infections. The
     oocyst excretion peaked with AC,was intermediate with the double infections and was lowest with
     TE. Regarding performance of chicks, lasalocid controlled all inoculations while the ef- ficacy
     of monensin was moderate, particularly when E.T was present in the inoculum. La- salocid
     reduced LSC to negligible levels and consequently these chicks excreted the smallest number of
     oocysts. For LSD and all oocyst excretions involving E.A salinomycin was most effective. In
     conclusion, the stronger pathogenicity of the double infection with two different coccidia
     species has not impaired the general efficacy of lasalocid.</p>

    <p>Chorioptes ovis, dynamics, control The paper deals with the population dynamics of chorioptic
     mange in a young ram rearing station with 3.000 hoggets of the high- yielding breed of
     Merinolangwollschaf - At stabling, visible lesions of mange at the feet are found in less than
     1 % of the animals. Reservoirs of mites are located in the fetlock region, on the scrotum and
     on the head, Later on, a seasonal increase of clinical symptoms is observed, combined with a
     decrease of the mite population. At the end of the rearing period 30 - 60 % of untreated rams
     show severe lesions on the feet and the scrotum.</p>
    <p>Treatment with Ivomec in the new dosis of 20 mg/50 kg bwt combined with a 0,25 % Permethrin
     foot dip controlled chorioptic mange completely, independently from treatment scheme. The

    <p>In the begining of 1989 a number of patients were admitted to different clinics with the
     following symptoms;fever,weightloss,cough,epigastric pain and other gastrointestinal
     symptoms.The abnormal laboratory findings were leukocytosis,considerable hypereosinophilia and
     often a raised ESR and a positive CRP.From 2364 patients with hypereosinophilia the feces of
     884 patients were studied (using different methods especially modified kato) for the presence
     of ova.ln 323 cases the ova of Fasciola sp.was observed.</p>
    <p>For a more accurate result 100 patients with more than 30 percent eosinophils in their
     differential count and a history of over three months were selected for parasitological
     studies.Iln the feces of 75 percent of these selected patients ova of Fasciola sp.was
     observed.Epidemiological studies showed that 75 percent of patients were females.The peak
     incidence of the disease was related to the rainy months of spring.91 percent of the patients
     had raw vegetables in their diet and the more common signs and symptoms
     included;weightloss(88%),epigastric pain(87%),right upper quadrant pain(79%), myalgia(78%)

    <p>EFFECTIVENESS OF PRAZIQUANTEL AGAINST TREMATODOSES OF FISH D.Zhatkanbayeva, R.A.Heckmann.

     trematodoses, diplostomosis, apatemonosis, praziquantel Trematodoses of fish are potentially
     dangerous for fish-breeding farms where they cause high mortality especially in the first year
     of life.</p>
    <p>However therapeutics of sick fish is poorly developed. Our aim was to study in the experiment
     Praziquantel effectiveness (56.8 mg per ml ac- tive ingredient) against diplostomosis and
     apatemonosis of fish.</p>
    <p>Nemachilus dorsalis from natural reservoirs I00% infected with meta- cercariae of Diplostomum
     pusillum and Apatemon gracilis were used in the experiments. The former species of the
     parasites infects the bot- tom of the eyeball, the latter - brain, heart, liver, gonads
     (ovary), swimming-bladder, intestine. Four series of tests were carried out.</p>
    <p>Twenty fishes were used in each series (average length 4.I cm), vari- ous doses of
     Praziquantel (0.I, 0.5, I.0, 2.0 ml per 50 1 of water) were tested. The preparation was added
     into the bath. It's known that Praziquantel penetrates into the tegument, causes muscles
     contraction, damage of integuments and destruction of internal organs of tremato- des. At the
     dose O.I-0.5 ml the parasites die within I-8 days, at the dose I.0 ml - I-4 hours, at the dose
     2.0 ml - 30-60 minutes. The ef- fectiveness of treatment in all the series was I00%. The
     preparation doesn't cause death and deviation in fish behaviour. We consider the use of
     Praziquantel against trematodoses of valuable fish species to be perspective in pond
     biocenoses.</p>

     Armenian SSR The influence of some biologically active preparations, particularly amilorizin
     P10x,copper sulphate and threshed sulphur on lambs' non-spe- cific (natural)resistance under
     mixed nematodose invasion of gastro-intes- tinal canal has been studied.As a result, on the
     basis of laboratory inves- tigations and production tests, onpurpose of non-specific therapy
     and pro- phylaxis a method of complex use of these preparations has been reccomen- ded
     according to the following scheme: from 1,5 months of age lambs feeding with amilorizin P10x
     has been carried out during 45 days, after a 30-day rest copper sulphate was included in the
     ration of animals during 10 days whereas after a 50-day rest, feeding with threshed sulphure
     has been car- ried out during 12 days.</p>
    <p>The use of preparations increases bacteriocid, lizocim and complementa- ry activities of
     blood serum (for 15, 46 and 63% accordingly), phagocyte activity of leucocytes (for 34%),
     vitamin C content in the organs (for 13%) and in blood albumen (for 33%), which results in
     decreasing animals' infec- tion intensity with nematodes of gastro-intestinal canal (for
     56,5?3,0%) end increasing the weight of lamb bodies for 2,6kg (27%) in comparison with
     nematode-infected animals, which have got no preparations.</p>

    <p>Different groups of wild and cultured sea bass from the Mediterranean area were examined for
     protozoan parasites, from December 1985 to January 1990. Wild fish harboured the following
     protozoans: — Myxosporea: Ceratomyxa sp.-1, Ceratomyxa sp.-2; Sphaerospora sp.-1, Sphaerospora
     testicularis Sitjà et Alvarez, 1989; Myxobilatus sp.</p>

    <p>- Ciltophora: Trichodina sp.-1, Trichodina sp.-2.</p>
    <p>- Sarcomastigophora: Cryptobia ? sp.</p>
    <p>All of them, except Myxobilatus sp., the microsporean and Eimeria spp., were also detected in
     cultured fish, usually with higher infection levels. Myxosporeans were particularly prevalent
     and some of them caused important pathogenic effects to the affected tissues.</p>
    <p>A seasonal pattern of infection and a distribution according to age and sex of host were
     observed for some parasites.</p>
    <p>These results demonstrate the actual importance of these protozoans for sea bass culture.
     Data on the population dynamics may provide useful information for monitoring prevention and
     control measures, specially when no treatment is available.</p>

    <p>Biology - coenurosis of animals Coenurosis is widely spread among sheep in Uzbek republic.
     The animal sus- ceptibility to this species is not studied enough. So we infected experi-
     mentally © dogs, free of invasion, with protoscolexes of coenurus cyst. The dogs were killed
     after the discovering of parasites in feces. We separated the mature parasites for the animals'
     invasion from the intestines. IO lambs IO kids and I2 piglets were infected by this material.
     The symptoms of acute stage of coenurosis were discovered on the IA-th day after invasion, but
     then they dissappeared after I2 days. The slaughter of lambs, kiddäs and piglets was 3-4 months
     after the invasion. 2-4 cysts were discovered, full of liquid with protoscolexes, in the brain
     of killed lambs, but at the sa- me time they were absent in the brain of killed kidds and
     piglets. But in the liver and brain the dead cysts were found, the size of wich was I sm, and
     they were of parasiti: origin. To our mind the discovered cysts were the formed parasites"
     oncospheres, which developed at first and then pe- rished of unknown to us reason. Study should
     be continued in this way.</p>

     Eradication - Sardinia In Sardinia Echinococcus granulosus affects most animals and is the
     cause of high economic losses to the livestock industry, as well as being a very serious public
     health problem. Efforts to deal with this problem in the past failed because of its complexity,
     high prevalence of infected animals, large number of strays dog, close associations of dogs and
     sheep, tranhumance practice, illegal slaughtering. Echinococ- cosis eradication campagne
     started in 1987 with the preparation by a scientific com- mittee of a project wich was approved
     by the Regional Government on march 1988. At the outset, a socioeconomic inquiry was made to
     see whether shepards and dog-onners were willing to support the plan or to cooperate in any
     particular way. On the same time, epidemiological studies and surveys of abattoirs were carried
     out to determine the exact prevalence of the disease. During 1989, a timetable for the various
     phases and objectives of the campaign were planned and the measures required were applied in
     two pilot areas, to verify the implementation of the programma at field level.</p>

     (France) Bovine nematodes : Haemonchus ; Cooperia : growth ; tropics The effects of
     gastro-intestinal parasitism on growth of calves before weaning, has been investigated in 4
     herds of creole calving cows grazing natural pastures in Guadeloupe (F.W.I.). Calving periods
     were dry season for two herds and rainy season for the others. ‘Animals grazed natural pastures
     according to a rotational system. For each season of calving, calves of one herd were monthly
     treated with Cambendazole.</p>
    <p>Parasitism of calves was assessed up to 7 month of age by feacal egg counts of all animals
     and autopsy of tracer animals. No parasitism was recorded on treated animals.</p>
    <p>During the 2 first months of age, major parasites were Neoascaris vitulorum and
     Strongyloiïdes papillosus. Then, Haemonchus placei, Cooperia spp. and Oesophagostomum Spp. were
     the more frequent parasites. À moderate peak of eggsper gramme of faeces of trichostrongyles
     was recorded during the fourth month of age (150 EPG). No clinical sign was recorded. Effect of
     parasitism was determined by adjusted weighting data to sex, birth weight, dairy production of
     cows, season of calving and herbage mass. The estimate weaning weight was 155.2 kg for treated
     animals and 140.1 kg for parasitised animals. Parasitism induced a significant decrease of
     albuminemia and hematocrit of calves.</p>

     out with Norske Hoechst A/S at Ewos’ research unit near Bergen, Norway in the autumn of 1989,
     on farmed 0.6-0.8 kg salmon, prevalence was 100 %, average intensity ca 9, the average weight
     of the worms constituted about 0.8 - 0.6 % of the fish weight.</p>
    <p>If these figures are typical, many tons of "live spaghetti" are farmed as a valueless
     byproduct.</p>
    <p>The infection in large salmon, up to 6 kg round-weight, was studied at slaughter in December
     1989 at a commercial salmon farm near Bergen; these fish had been treated with anthelminthic
     one year before (November 1988). In 149 salmon studied (64 males, 85 females) the prevalence
     was 56 %, the average intensity for both sexes combined was 2.2 worms. The combined weight of
     the 186 cestodes recovered was 192.1 g, constituting slightly less than 0.03 % of the combined
     round-weight (644.5 kg) of the 149 fish. The round-weight of infected fish was significantly
     lower than uninfected fish. The difference in average round-weight between clean (5.18 kg) and
     infected males was 0.8 kg, that between clean (4.2 kg) and infected female fish was 0.52 kg.
     This shows that the weight gain in salmon is negatively influenced by the presence of the
     cestodes.</p>

     influence of concurrent exposure to a crude oil and an infection, Trypanosoma murmanensis, on
     survival/mortality in winter flounder, Pseudopleuronectes americanus. Both juvenile and adult
     flounder were infected and exposed to various concentrations (*100 to 2200 ug/g) of
     oil-contaminated sediment for 8 weeks at 0-1°C in flow-through seawater aquaria with
     corresponding uncontaminated, infected and uninfected groups. Mortality occurred earlier and
     was greater in juvenile fish exposed to crude oil than in adults.</p>
    <p>However, a larger percentage of oil-treated, infected, adult flounders died after exposure at
     the highest concentrations. Selected organ somatic indices and blood values in surviving
     flounder were affected more in the infected, oil-treated fish than in corresponding controls at
     the highest concentrations. The prolonged period of patency of T. murmanensis in the
     oil-treated groups might be associated with immunosuppression.</p>

     to insufficient knowledge of the status of the liver fluke in horses, little interest was paid
     to the trematode of this host. The infection causes only little pathological changes in horses
     and typical clinical symptoms are not showing. As only few cases were detected there was no
     need to develop special remedies for the treatment of horses; fasciolicides from other
     countries are of limited use.</p>
    <p>Because of coincidental findings in 1 - 2 year old horses it was necessary to carry out
     investigations under field conditions. The main source of infection was the sharing of pasture
     by infected ruminants. The application of remedies which had proved to be successful with other
     animal species did not meet our expectations.</p>
    <p>From our own experience some remarcable consequences have to be drawn for the practice: a) In
     future more attention has to be paid to the diagnosis of the liver fluke in the horse. | b)
     Experience gained with ruminants is only of limited use; concerning the horse it has to be
     checked critically.</p>
    <p>c) By means of natural and experimental infections an efficient anthelmintic has to be found
     for the treatment of horses.</p>
    <p>d) Separate keeping of horse and cattle has to limit the risk of infection prophylacti- cally
     or even prevent it.</p>

    <p>ON PARASITOLOGI CAL INSPECTION OF MARINE COMMERCIAL FISHES Yu. V.Kurochkin, L.I.Biserova.
     Division of Parasitology, Caspian Rese- arch Institute of Fisheries. Savushkina, 1, Astrakhan,
     414056, USSR Parasites - Marine fishes - Financial losses - Regulations Parasite fauna of every
     marine fish species usually consists of several dozens of parasite species, and their
     prevalence (extensity) and inten- sity can sometimes be very high. Although parasites are
     normal compo- nents of ecosystems, it is well-known that presence of some parasites in marine
     fishery products can cause enormous financial losses, especi- ally in countries with developed
     marine fishing industries. One of the important ways to reduce such financial losses is the
     skilled parasito- logical inspecting of raw and processed marine fishes intended for hu- man
     consumption. The inspection allows to evaluate quality of fish batch and can recommend
     appropriate methods of processing and ways of utilisation. Parasitological Tnssaoti on of
     marine fishes is aimed at preventing of marketing of marine food stuffs of poor quality or
     detri- mental to human health (because of parasites) and also at preventing of unjustified
     rejection of food production of enough good quality. State regulations and standards existing
     in different countries are mostly regional, not universal and not always satisfactory. On the
     basis of results of some special investigations and using numerous data from recent marine
     parasitological literature we have perfected old and elaborated some new principles, methods
     and standards of parasitologi- cal inspecting of marine fishes. We prepared new methodical and
     norma- tive documents which were approved from 1989 as State Regulations for our fishing
     industry and trade.</p>

    <p>ABOUT DEVASTATION OF COENUROSIS IN BUKHARA REGION.</p>
    <p>N.M. Matchanov Institute of zoology and parasitology, UzSSR, Tashkent, 700095, 4A.Nyasova I
     The founder of helminthological science, academician ï.I. Skrjabin introduced new doctrine
     about devastation into parasitology. It was named as method of of- fensive active prophylaxis.
     This method is directed to annihilation of the patho- genes on all stages of their life cycle
     (in organism of a man, animals and in en- vironment) by any possible means of mechanical,
     chemical, physical or biological influence. We investigate the ecologic peculiarities of larval
     taenideés (coenu- rus, cysticercus, echinococcous, alveococcus) in various natural landscapes
     of Uzbekistan. Thr complex of ecologic researches exposed life cycle of larval tae- nidosis,
     their interaction with host and environment. Larval taenidosis do great harm to health of
     population and enormous economic damage to live-stock farming- Due to this their control became
     a great state problem. The basis of senitation measures, worked out by us, includes planned
     dehelmintization of all registered dogs twice a year - in spring before lambing and in autumn
     before sheep shearing; systematic annihilation of all stray dogs; timely isolation of the
     animals,ill with coenurosis and auinihilation them in slaughter house; organization of correct
     removement of animals' carcasses, annihilation of infected organs of killed ani- mals and
     prevention from invasion distribution; systematic allergo-diagnostic inspection of sheep for
     echinococcus and prevention of ill females from reproduc- tion; reliable fencing of
     meat-packing plant territory to avoid dogs get in; in- vestigation of new anthelmintics; wide
     instructive work among people, especially among cattle-breeders. As à result of practical
     application of developed by us scientific measures, sheep live-stock was sanitated in 5-6 years
     in greatest live-stock farmins Bukhara region. Thus, invasion of men and pollution of en-
     vironment was prevented.</p>

     consequences of érichostrangylesis the effect of various anthelmintic drugs and time of
     treatment on the body-weight gain in cattle and sheep was examined.</p>
    <p>Studies were carried out for S years (1985-89) on two farms of young cattle (421 head) and
     two fliocks of sheep - (266 head).</p>
    <p>On each farm the animals were divided into 3 groups according to age, weight and EFG.</p>
    <p>Two groups were treated with Nilverm or Fenbesan (Fanacur) respectively twice a year, one
     group being untreated. On one farm the animals were treated in May and August on the other in
     November and May. During the experiment the animals were weighting every Z months. In all
     treated groups animals gained more then untreated control.</p>
    <p>After one year Neue cattle and sheep treated with Nilverm in May and August gained 16.1Hg
     (13.95%) and 7.4kg (16.27%) more than control. Those treated in November and May gained 9.8kg
     (10,1%) and 6.4kg (17.3%) respectively. Animals treated with Fenbesan in May and August gained
     14.7kg (8.2%) and 8.7kg (18.7%) more than control and those treated in November and May: 12.4kg
     (11.23%) and Fa EN {7.8%) respectively. The use of anthelmintics in May and MU was more
     profitable, differences in body weight bein statistically significant. Îhe above results will
     be utilized to elaborate the contro program against gastro-intestinal nematodes in cattle as
     well as to modernize the current control program against these parasites in sheep.</p>

     Swine - Finland A modified McMaster method was used to examine 5275 faecal samples from
     different age groups of swine from 185 herds located in different parts of Finland. Extensive
     management data was also collected from the herds.</p>
    <p>Oocyst-positive faecal samples were sporulated in a 2.5% K,Cr,0, solution to be able to
     identify the species. The total coccidian prevalence was 3.7% in sucklings, 0.4% in weaners,
     0.7% in small and 1.7% in large fatteners, 5.8% in gilts, 3.1% in dry and 0.3% in lactating
     sows and 1.83% in boars. The species were: Isospora suis (Biester and Murray 1934), Eimeria
     debliecki (Deuwes 1921), E.neodebliecki (Vetterling 1965), E.perminuta (Henry 1931), E.scabra
     (Henry 1931) and one Eimeria species still not definitely identified. I.suis was the only
     species found in sucklings and it occurred sparsely in weaners also, while older animals were
     only found to harbour Eimeria spp. The most common of these was E.debliecki, followed by
     E.neodebliecki, E.scabra, the unidentified species and E.perminuta. The prevalence of I.suis
     was associated with large herd size and early weaning. The prevalence of Eimeria spp. was
     associated with outdoor rearing. The observed prevalence of both I.suis and Eimeria spp. was
     low when compared with results from many other countries. Although coccidia do not presently
     cause noteworthy porcine health problems in Finland, changes in management, like bigger herds
     or more common outdoor rearing, may benefit them and also increase their pathogenicity.</p>

    <p>Sarcocystis, swine, IGF-1, growth hormone, IGF-1 binding protein Levels of growth factors
     were assayed in pigs infected with Sarcocystis miescheriana, a protozoan parasite that retards
     growth of growing swine. Sixteen pigs averaging 14 kg were evenly divided into four groups.
     Experimental groups were infected per os with 0 (Group C), 0.5 x 105 (Group L), 1.0 x 10%
     (Group M), and 3.0 x 106 (Group H) sporocysts of S. meischeriana. Pigs were provided food ad
     libitum and were weighed weekly. Blood samples were obtained weekly commencing 2 weeks prior to
     infection and for 9 weeks after infection (WAI). VWeights significantly lower than controls (p
     &lt; 0.05) were seen in Group H beginning 2 WAI and in Group L and M beginning 3 WAI.
     Radioimmunoassays were used to measure serum levels of insulin-like growth factor-l (IGF-1),
     insulin-like Growth factor-1 binding protein (IGF-1 BP), and growth hormone. IGF-1 levels
     dropped significantly (p &lt; 0.05) during the acute phase of the infection 2 WAI in all
     infected groups. Conversely, IGF-1 BP levels were elevated significantly (p &lt; 0.05) at this
     point of the infection. The extent of these effects was directly related to the original
     parasite inoculum. Following the acute phase, values recovered to levels not significant from
     Group C levels where they remained for the duration of the experiment with the exception of
     IGF-1 levels at 6 WAI and IGF-1 BP levels at 6, 7, and 8 WAI in Group H. No significant effect
     was demonstrated in growth hormone levels. These data suggest a possible mechanism through
     which growth is affecte in feeder pigs infected with S. miescheriana.</p>

     ships between the prevalence of parasitism and herd factors were examined.</p>
    <p>The prevalence of Ascaris suum in the different groups of swine were only moderately
     correlated with herd factors. Multivariate analyses showed that 'country' in general was highly
     significant (highest prevalences in DK, N and S), and in 2 age groups the effect of 'weaning
     age' (late wea- ning: high prevalences). Neither anthelmintic treatment, hygiene nor housing
     were significant in any of the groups.</p>
    <p>The prevalence of Oesophagostomum sp. in adult swine was much more depen- dent on herd
     factors. Multivariate analyses showed that ‘country' and ‘anthelmintic treatment' were
     significantly correlated with the prevalence in all groups (highest in DK and S and in herds
     with no routine treat- ment). Also pen conditions were significant (high prevalence was
     recorded when straw bedding, outdoor runs or no daily cleaning occurred), while neither washing
     nor disinfection were significant.</p>
    <p>With respect to Coccidia, the prevalence of Isospora suis in piglets was significantly
     correlated with 'country' (low prevalences in N and SF) and several housing and hygiene factors
     (high prevalence in large herds, SPF- herds, pens with slatted floors and when chalk or

    <p>Cryptosporidium parvum ie à common parasite in cattle,whose presence and incidence depends
     upon the elvironmental conditions of the animals.This study was carried out on a dairy farm
     with 300 Holstein cows.The males are sold a few days after birth,so the study was carried out
     on females only.The new born calves are separatead from their mothers inmediately after
     birth,and received a colostral mixture during the next two days.For the following 50 days,they
     are isolated from the adults and fed with powderad milk.40 days before giving birth,the cows
     are vaccinated against coronavirus,rotavirus and Escherichia coli,ln the faecee of the
     adult:cows studied,small amounte of Cryptosporidium oocystse and some Entamoeba ep cysts were
     observed, but no trace of any others parasites.</p>
    <p>The study of the cailvee begins with their birth with daily analysis of fasces and blood
     specimens.The cryptosporidiosts in the calves 1s associated with a diarrhoeic procesees in
     which faacea show a characteristic yellow-greenish colour ,According to our present data,the
     incidence of Cryptosporidium on this farm ie 9O%,the mean prepatent period is from 7 to 10 days
     after the birth and the bulk emission of oocysts persgiets to the 15 to 20 days of life.</p>

    <p>Warble Fly, Hypoderma, Eradication Monitoring of the continued warble fly eradication
     programme in Britain was carried out by means of an expanded serological surveillance programme
     based on the specially modified ELISA testing method. This included 152,434 cattle blood
     samples (1.5% of the national herd) from 6,175 farms, during 10 weeks from February to April.
     Thirty-nine positive animals (0.2%) were identified on 21 farms (0.34% of farms). This is a
     reduction in disease level to approximately half of the level identified the previous year
     (0.039%). The proportion of infected farms fell from 0.58% in 1988 to 0.34% in 1989, and
     national reports of warble-infested cattle from 4.0 to 2.0 respectively for these two seasons.
     Early results for the 1990 survey suggest continuing improvements.</p>

    <p>S7.E 27 P.+0 FURTHER INVESTIGATIONS ON THE PRACTICABILITY OF USING À LIVE VACCINE AS À
     CONTROL MEASURE FOR TOXOPLAMOSIS IN SHEEP M.F Wilkins, E.O'Connell - New Zealand Preliminary
     exper imental and field vaccination tr'ials in New Zealand showed that a live incomplete strain
     of 7. ga’ significantly protected ewes from lamb losses attr ibutable to toxoplasmosis. These
     trials also showed that lamb losses were consider ably more than those previously indicated by
     diagnostic report. The question therefore arose as to the practicality of using the live
     vaccine as a control measure for toxoplasmosis in sheep on a widespread scale.To assess whether
     a live vaccine would be acceptable, an extensive field trial was conducted with the minimum
     disruption to the normal farm routine. Following lambing, the differences in lambing
     performances between vaccinated and control ewes on each farm was assessed.</p>
    <p>Statistical analysis indicated that vaccination gave an average decrease in dry ewe
     percentage of 13,5% and an average increase in final lambing percentage of 2,8%.Both
     differences in the performance of the vaccinated and control ewes were highly significant. Over
     50 of farms had positive increase in lambing percentage suggesting that a measurable field
     challenge of Toxoplasma had occurred on these properties during the breeding season. This trial
     achieved its main aim ,8s it reaveled a strong market demand for a vaccine against
     Toxoplasmosis in sheep.</p>
    <p>Difficulties associated with the manufacture and distribution of a live, short shelf-life
     vaccine were successfully overcome. Suggestions that the handling of a vaccine for Toxoplasma
     would be hazardous were shown to be unjustified.</p>

    <p>Epidemiological Studies on Taeniasis Suis and Cysticercosis in Huai Yang county ih Henan
     Province In this report,we investigated 26,655 villagers in 26 villages in 5 towmships.The
     results indicated that infection rates of taeniasis and cysticercosis were approximately 0.75%
     and 0.20X,respectively Ye calculated with the rates that there were 8,000 and 2,000 villagers
     with cestode and cysticercus infections, respectively. It was proved that the diseases were
     common in the county with sporatic characteristics. The results also provided a base to
     calculate the infection rates in similar areas Studies on environment, toilets and cultivation
     practice of pigs, the intermediate hosts and infec- tion of cysticercus showed that in any
     villages with high morbidity rate of taenïasis,the infection rates of cellulosae and human
     cysticercosis were high either,indicating parallel relationship.Young people and adults were
     mainly infected with cestode and cysticercus.Self-infectinn was a main infe- ction way for
     human cysticercosis. During 1980-86,the possitive rate of cellulosae cysticercosis in local
     areas was 6.54%, the annual average economic loss was up to Y 56,700.Theretore to control the
     diseases, it is imperative to take multiple control mearsures including to prosoer economics,to
     ca- rry out persistent health education to improve poor health behaviour and to strengthen
     motives of self-protection. All the above will provide a base for better control of the
     disbases.</p>

    <p>Trypanosoma evansi, rabbit, chronic, immune suppression.</p>
    <p>The effects of Trypanosoma evansi infections in rabbit were investigated using 8 and 16 weeks
     old male animals. The trypanosomes were first cloned in mice and a dose of 1x106 of the
     homologous organisms were injected intravenously into each rabbit. Blood smears were prepared
     daily for parasitaemia and individual sera were collected at weekly intervals and purified with
     ion-exchange chromatography using DEAE cellulose DE 53. The sera were used to detect Ilg M and
     Ig G using immunofluorescent antibody technique.</p>
    <p>Both groups experienced':low and long lasting type of parasitaemias with eventual death which
     occured 41-58 days post infection. Loss of body weight, loss of body condition and appetite
     together with oedema of the genital organs and ocular discharge were also noted.</p>
    <p>lg M and Ig G were first detected in the blood 2 weeks post infection and the titres reached
     the peak (titre of 5120-10240 for 1g G and 320-640 for Ig M) on the 4th week.</p>
    <p>However, the titres gradually decreased starting from the 5th week until the animals die.</p>
    <p>These results suggest the T. evansi caused a chronic type of infection in rabbits and the
     death which occured was possibly due to immune suppression to antibody production.</p>

     Bothriocephalus opsa- riichthidis (B.o.) in ponds and warmwater cage farms. Tt was found that
     technological, temperature and other conditions of carp rearing in cages on warm water
     considerably deteriorate epiozootic situation on bothrio- cephalosis. In evaluating B.o. effect
     the objective infection indicator is infection indice (I.I.) determined as relation of helminth
     weight to infected fish weight and expressed in %. B.o. can be related to highly pathogenic
     helminths. The results of hematological research showed that changes in erythrocyte and
     leucocyte counts were noted at I.I. equal to 2.4-2,7%. However, these changes in blood picture
     are not specific as they differ in respect to fish rearing conditions (in ponds or cages).</p>
    <p>B.o. exercises a negative effect on carp fry growth, which is revealed at I.I. = 2.5-3.0% and
     is considerably increased with fish infection rise: at I.I.= 3-5% - by 20%, at I.I. = 15-18% -

     USSR, Our study was carried out for 12 years (1977-1989). Preparations from 198 operated
     echinococcosis patients and 48 fatal cases in echino- coccus carries from the clinics of
     Samarkand Medical Institute were em- ployed. We also used preparations from 156 karakul sheep,
     28 swines,18 caws invaded with echinococci. We found that sarcosporidias were conco- mitant
     agents together with echinococci. For the first time we. revealed simultaneous presence of
     sarcosporidias and echinococci in 3 patients.</p>
    <p>Autopsy demonstrated heart localization of sarcosporidias in humans. Si- multaneous
     prevalence rate of echinococcosis/sarcosporidiosis in produc- tive animals was above 50%. Mixed
     sarcosporidiosis/hydatidosis invasion in the organism of intermidiate host had more severe
     form. We found that larval hydatidosis had different relations with various pathogenic micro
     orsanisms. Monocultures of streptococci, staphylococci, Bac.cereus,Pro- teus vulgaris,
     staphylococci in association with diplococci or strepto- cocci, associations of Corynebacterium
     and streptococcus uberis, Bac.ce- reus and Proteus vulgaris do not cause the loss of
     invasiveness in echi- nococcus scolexes and distinct anatomo-morphological changes. Abovemen-
     tioned microorganisms parasitizing in the larval forms of echinococcus preserve their
     pathogenic characteristics. Staphylococci in association with microorganisms belonging to the
     group of intestinal bacilli cause the killing of the embrionic elements of echinococcus but do
     not lose high level of their virulence.</p>

    <p>Taenia Faecal Antigen Reliable diagnosis of adult Taenia infections is difficult at present.
     A test for parasite specific antigen in the host's faeces may solve this problem. To this end
     capture type ELISA assays have been developed to detect antigen in faecal supernatants. Antigen
     was shown to be present in the absence of eggs in Taenia solium infections of immunosupressed
     Golden hamsters. No egg negative samples from human infections have thus far been tested but
     those with very low egg counts are strongly positive by ELISA. Application of the technique to
     a field study in Guatemala was undertaken and no cross reaction was shown with the T.solium
     ELISA assay and heterologous helminths other than T.saginata.</p>
    <p>The test appears to be promising for further development and application in the diagnosis of

    <p>Hydatid Disease in Xinjiang, PRC À program for hydatid disease control was evaluated in 16
     randomly selected villages in 2 communities in Xinjiang, PRC, in an area where hydatid disease
     is known to be endemic. Factors tested included the effect of: 1) the role of a village hydatid
     disease control officer ["CO"], 2) the use of praziquantel-medicated "bait"-tablets for
     treatment of Echinococcus granulosus in dogs, and 3) the use of educational materials for
     children and adults. Four villages comprising Group I ("controls") had no CO’s, no drug for
     dogs, and no educational materials. The 4 villages in each of the other 3 groups had contact
     from a CO and received their supply of medicated tablets and educational materials at the first
     of a 10-month trial period only (Group II), on a monthly basis (Group 111), or twice each month
     (Group IV), respectively. Evaluation of the project was done by determining the infection level
     in 25 dogs selected from each of the 16 villages before and after the trial period, and by use
     of pre- and post-treatment questionnaires distributed to 40 randomly selected households in
     each village. Infection levels in dogs decreased in all treatment groups (an average decrease
     from 16.2% to 4.3%), but decreased most (14.4% to 0.9%) in Group IV. Statistically significant
     increases in knowledge levels and life style changes toward more favorable behavior were noted
     most in Group III. We project that the cost for implementation of this experimental program in
     other small villages in Xinjiang would approximate $1/person/yr, and that the program would
     need to continue for at least 5 years.</p>

     Schistosome dermatits was first rrportel by Cort in 1928. Vogel used cercarial dermatitis in
     1930. Sahba and Malek (1979) found cercariae of Orientobilharzia turkestanicum to be one of the
     causes of dermatits in the caspian Sea area, Present study was a continuation of Sahba et al's
     finding of Trichobilharzia sp. in domestic and wild waterfowls, and its cercariae as a second
     agent of causing dermatits (commonly termed as "“Beejar-Dooneh" in the local area).
     Epidemiology and treatment of infected people were also studied. of cercaria dermatits.</p>
    <p>Wild waterfowl and domestic ducks were purchased in living condition. The mucus and veins of
     the nasal region were dissected in water under a issecting microscope.</p>
    <p>Eggs, hatched miracidia and segment of worms were used for further morphological and
     succesptibiliity study of snails. Snails were collected from rice fields in separate plastic
     buckets for each locality and examined for cercariae.</p>
    <p>Barku-Sara, a village with à total population of 2894, was selected for epidemiological study
     and treatment. A number of women working in the rice fields with dermatits were recorded and
     treated with Crotamiton. A follow up of the patients who received crotamiton was carried out
     for the evaluation of the treatment.</p>
    <p>A total of 188 waterfowls was examined. Overall infection rate with Trichobilharzia sp. was
     8.54. The rates were 4,5% and 27.2% in wild waterfowls and domestic ducks respectively.
     Infection of naturally and experimentally infected laboratory bred Lymnaea palustris proved it

     15, A-1095 Vienna, Austria Alveolar echinococcosis in Austria Since the turn of the century it
     has been known that Austria is - like southern Germany, eastern France and Switzerland - part
     of the Central European distribution area of Echinococcus muitilocularis, the causative
     organism of alveolar echinococcosis (AËT. Recent distributional data obtained between 1983 and
     1990 confirmed that E. multilocutaris is still prevalent in the western and southern provinces
     and revealed, in addition, the occurence of autochthonous alvenlar echinococcosis in the
     northeast of Austria outside the range of the Alps. In contrast to the endemic areas in
     Switzerland and southern Germany the incidence of AE in Austria, however, seems to be rather
     low: Presently 1 to 2 new cases of AE are diagnosed in Austria, the real incidence, however,
     being probably at least 3 to 5 cases per year.</p>

     Lisboa,Portugal Helminthic zoonoses - fox Portugal The study of the helminthic fauna of the fox
     (Vulpes vulpes silacea MILLER, 1907) in Portugal took place between 1970 and 1987. Some 306
     foxes were shot down throughout the country to maintain biological balance. It was found that
     283 of them (92.5%) were shown to have parasites at least by one of helminthic species. The
     recorded helminths have been studied as bio logical-tags (taxonomical, ethological and
     geographical indicators) and presented in several papers at international scientific meetings.
     The pre- sent study emphasizes the potential natural foci of human disease in Portu gal, not
     only in the anthropocentric point of view but also in terms of bio logical balance: The authors
     enhance the interest in studying pathobioce - nosis of the most important helminths for the

     leptospirosis among dogs from the north of Portugal (Alijé region), considering its well known
     importance as a source of infection to man. A total of 868 sera of 701 rural dogs were tested
     by the microscopic agglutination test for leptospiral antibodies. Positive titres (&gt;1:100)
     to Leptospira interrogans were detected in 215 (30.7) dogs, with a significative higher
     prevalence rate of infection in males. The titres of 49 out of 215 (32.1%) seropositive
     reactors were &gt;1:800, possibly.indicating recent infection. It was detected a relevant
     predominance of Canicola and Sejroe serogroups (at least, 64.0% and 20.0%, respectively) among
     all the leptospirosis cases. The unusual evidence of Sejroe canine reactors in which a single
     serogroup predominated is enhanced. À multiple parameter statistical analysis of the obtained
     data especially by age, sex and origin of the animals is performed. This analysis improves the
     actual knowledge of the epidemiological dog's role in the distribution of leptospirosis in

     Ciencias Agrärias e Veterinarias-UNESP, 14870-Jaboticabal- Sao Paulo- Brazil Toxoplasma gondii,
     swine, reinoculation, immunity Considering the high frequency of natural toxoplasmic infection
     in swine one may infer that pigs are subject to a high risk of coming in contact with infective
     forms of such a protozoon. This experiment's objective was to investigate an eventual
     reinfection or surerinfection of such a host species with T. gondii or, in case it failed to
     get established, any findings that might indicate an immunity attributable to a previous
     Toxoplasma inoculation. For this 8 four months old Wessex swine were subject to intravenous
     injection of 40x10$ tachyzoites of a moderately virulent strain of T. gondii; 36 days later a
     new injection was made through the same route, using a fully virulent strain of the protozoon
     and 2xl07 tachyzoites per animal. À control group of 2 animals received only the first
     inoculation. Hyperthermia and parasitemia (up to the 12th day) were detected only after the
     first inoculation. The humoral reaction detected by indirect immunofluorescence observed since
     the 6th day after inoculation showed that the denominators of the titles ordinary fractions
     were significantly higher after the second when compared with those after the first inoculation
     (p&lt;0,05). Neutropenia and eosinopenia were seen after both the first and the second
     inoculations, respectively.</p>
    <p>Lymphocytosis appeared in both occasions. Not only in the initial period of infection but
     also in the one following the reinoculation these observations were made: hypoglycemia,
     hypolipemia, hyperbilirubinemia and hyperproteinemia. No anatomo-histopathological alteration
     that might suggest toxoplasmosis was observed in swine slaughtered 60 days after reinoculation.
     The above results suggest that a previous inoculation of the swine with one strain of T. gondii
     protected them against a second and larger dosis of tachyzoites from a more virulent strain of
     the same parasite.</p>

    <p>A community of 549 inhabitants was studied by parasitoscopic stool analysis for detection of
     intestinal parasites by the methods of Faust, Ritchie and Kato. T. solium was diagnosed in
     1.32%. Prevalence of other intestinal helminths was high: Hymenolepis nana: 22%; Trichuris
     trichiura: 9%; Ascaris lumbricoides: 3%. Seropositivity to T.</p>
    <p>solium metacestode antigens by ELISA was found to be 11%. Seropositivity in family members
     living with a tapeworm carrier was 28%. Helminths tended to be clustered ïin households and
     certain sections of the village. High seropositivity was found to correlate with town sections
     which had tapeworm clusters. Praziquantel (10 mg/kg) was administered to 70% of the population
     over 5 years of age. No additional tapeworms were recovered. À follow-up study one year later
     gave the following results: T.</p>
    <p>solium: 0%, H. nana: 13%, T. trichiura: 3.5%, A. lumbricoides: 0%. Prevalence of intestinal
     parasites was reduced from 76% to 42%, seropositivity from 11% to 7%.</p>
    <p>Preliminary analysis of serology, indicated that 90% of serologically positive individuals
     ïin stage 2 were new and that 40% had received praziquantel in stage 1.</p>
    <p>Furthermore, 88% of seropositive individuals in stage 1 became seronegative in stage 2,
     suggesting that immunity to T. solium metacestode antigens is of short duration.</p>
    <p>Clinical history of epileptic seizures (suggestive of neurocysticercosis) was diagnosed in
     1.47% of the population, 62.5% of which were seropositive. The relative risk of having
     epileptic seizures and being seropositive was 11.25 (95% confidence intervai 5.2, 24.4). It is
     concluded that large-scale antihelminthic treatment is effective in reducing intestinal

     investigation on prevalence of toxoplasmosis in slaughtered pigs in Austria 2351 blood samples
     and 327 tissue samples (diaphragm and heart) were collected. 2238 pigs originated mainly from
     large modern fattening farms (group A), while 113 pigs had been kept in small breeding farms
     (group B). The blood samples were used for serological examination after the indirect
     fluorescent antibody test (IFAT). The tissue samples were homogenized for microscopic
     demonstration of cysts and for oral inoculation in mice. The mice which became positive were
     used to infect cats.</p>
    <p>Specific antibodies against Toxoplasma gondii were demonstrated in 12.2% of sera of pigs of
     group À, while 43.47 of animals of group B reacted positively. In à single trial, the
     inoculated mice showed IFAT-titres of 1:256000 eight weeks after infection with samples from a
     pig heart. Toxoplasma gondii cysts were demonstrated in brains and skletal muscles of these
     mice. Cats fed with infected mice tissues proved to be sero- positive. À titer of 1:1CC0 in tke
     haemagglutination test was obtained. Moreover, these cats passed Toxoplasma gondii oocysts in
     faeces. Through modernpigfattening systems, the prevalence of porcine toxoplasmosis in Austria
     during the last years is obviously decreasing. The present investigations indicate that pigs
     meat plays only a secondary role in the epidemiology of human toxoplasmosis in Austria.</p>

     Rudimentary-hooklet-cysticercus - Taenia saginata-like tapeworm Although people in the Asian
     countries eat more raw and/or un&amp;ercooked meat and viscera of pigs than cattle, Taenia
     saginata has been reported to be the dominate species and Cysticercus cellulosae in pigs has
     been found more often than Cysticercus bovis in cattle. In order to explain this special
     epidemiological phenomenon, eggs of the T. saginata-like tapeworms from Taiwan, Korea,
     Indonesia, and Thailand were inoculated to different kinds of domestic and wild animals ard
     succeeful experiments in infecting pigs, caif, goat, and monkey with Taiwan Taenia (mature
     cysticerci only found in pigs and calf); pigs, calf, and goat with Korea Taenia (mature
     cysticerci only found in pigs); pigs and calf with Thailand Taenia (mature cysticerci only
     found in pigs); and pigs with Indonesia Taenia. All rudimentary-hooklet-cysterci were recovered
     only from the liver of these animals except a few cysticerci in the omentum of two pigs.
     Moreover, one wild boar on Taiwan Proper and six domestic pigs on Lanyu Island were also found
     naturally infected with rudimentary-hooklet-cysticerci in their livers. Therefore, pig is the
     most favorable intermediate host of these T. saginata-tapeworms. Moreover, these cysticerci
     have 2 rows of rudimentary hooklets, shorter developmental period, and smaller size than those
     of T. saginata and T. solium. These results indicate that pig is also the most important
     intermediate host in the endemic areas of the above countries and these four Asian strains of
     Taenia are very similar but very different from both T.</p>
    <p>saginata and T. solium. Recently, differences between Taiwan Taenia and African T.</p>
    <p>saginata have been identified in the molecular level by the DNA analysis. From the special
     epidemiological pattern and the experimental results, we suggest that the T.</p>
    <p>saginatalike tapeworm in Asian may be of the same new species.</p>

     echinococcosis was distributed among farm animals as follows: cattles, sheep, pigs are infected
     at 30, 35 and 12%, respecti- vely. Solid-hoofed animals and camels were infected with
     echinococcosis too. Dogs are the main vector of invasion (25%). Pubescent samples of this
     helmints were determined in wolfs and shakals. The prolonged inve- stigation showed cats are

    <p>Echinococcus granulosus - wildlife - Australia.</p>
    <p>The tablelands of South-East Australia is an important area for human hydatidosis.</p>
    <p>During the last 20 years several successful control campaigns have substantially reduced the
     prevalence of Echinococcus granulosus in domestic dogs in the region.</p>
    <p>Despite this, there has been minimal change in the number of annual hospital admissions in
     the region. Following the confirmation of à case of human hydatidosis of the wild life strain
     this study was initiated to determine the prevalence and strain type of E.granulosus in
     wildlife in the region. Dingoes, foxes, feral cats, macropods, feral pigs and goats were
     trappped. The intestine of the carnivores were examined for adult worms and the internal organs
     of the non-carnivores examined for hydatid cysts. All isolates were strain typed on
     morphological criteria.</p>
    <p>The parasite is widespread in the region, but unevenly distributed areas of low and high
     transmission were identified. Foxes, hitherto considered unimportant in the life cycle, were
     regularly found to be infected. An infected fox recovered from Canberra City, highlights their
     potential importance in transmission in urban areas. Numerous isolates did not fit the wildlife
     or domestic strain categories.</p>
    <p>It is suspected different host species affect parasite development, suggesting the previous
     widely held belief that there are 2 genetically distinct strains may be equivocal.</p>

     hygiene Meat from animals infected with Toxoplasma gondii, if eaten raw or undercooked, is a
     potential source of infection in humans. Since the killing effects of microwaves on various
     microorganisms in food has been questioned, the aim ofthe present study was to investigate the
     survival ofencysted T! gondii in mutton either after cookingin a microwave oven or after
     freezing at -20°C. Meat on the bone from the hindlegs of each of four sheep infected with T.
     gondii was used. Microwave cooking was performed in a household microwave oven during which the
     temperature was measured in the centre of the meat. According to standard recipes cooking was
     interrupted when the temperature had reached +65°C. Equivalent cuts of meat from the same
     animals were also kept at -20°C for 60 hours. Samples of meat treated by these methods as well
     as non-treated, raw meat from the same four sheep were then examined for viable Toxoplasma
     organisms by mouse inoculation.</p>
    <p>T. gondii was isolated from untreated meat from all four animals used, but in no case from
     meat that had been stored at -20°C, which is in agreement with similar previous studies.
     However, in two of the four cuts of meat processed in the microwave oven, the parasite remained
     infective, possibly due to uneven heating of the meat. To avoid the risk ofingesting live
     Toxoplasma organismsit is recommended that meat intended for primary microwave cooking should
     be either frozen and thawed before cooking or subjected to a longer cooking time to allow a
     higher temperature to be reached in the centre of the meat.</p>

     significantly associated with diarrhoea (OR=2.9, p=.0003). The prevalence was highest, 9.5%, in
     children aged below 18 months (RR=2.2, p&lt;.0001), an age at which preva- lences of other
     parasites were low. Cryptosporidium sp. consistently was more prevalent in the three rainy
     seasons, 9.5%, compared to 3.0% in the dry seasons, p&lt;.0001. Episodes of cryptosporidiosis
     often be- came persistent, associated with weight loss, and a high acute and de- layed
     mortality (OR=2.8 by Cox regression analysis).</p>
    <p>Conclusion: Cryptosporidiosis is highly seasonal and a major cause af diarrhoeal morbidity
     and mortality in infants and very small children.</p>

     Giacomo 9/2 40126 Bologna Italie Dirofilariose humaine Italie - 23 cas Dans le Laboratoire de
     Parasitologie de notre Institut on a observé, depuis 1971, 23 cas de dirofilariose humaine (sur
     80 signalés en Italie) dont 22 ont pu être identifiés comme étant dûs à Dirofilaria repens,
     (Railliet et Henry, 1911) nématode parasite du chien re- lativement fréquent en Italie,
     transmis habituellement par des Culicidès. De ces 23 cas, 20 étaient à localisation
     souscutanée, 2 muqueuse et 1 pulmonaire. La parasitose a été presque toujours meconnue
     cliniquement étant interprétée dans la presque totalité des cas comme une néoplasie benigne ou
     maligne ou comme un kyste sébacé. Le parasite a pu être reconnu grâce à l' examen des coupes
     histologiques, en se basant sur ses dimensions, caractères morphologiques internes et en
     particuliér sur l'aspect typiquement dentelé vers l'exterieur de sa cuticule. Dans 2 cas on a
     pu énucléer du nodule l' helminthe entier et on a pu ainsi décrire les caractères
     morphologiques après éclaircissement au lactophénol d'Ammann. On a l'impression que la
     parasitose soit beaucoup plus fréquente dans l'homme en Italie de ce qu' il apparait de la
     littérature scientifique, plusieurs cas à notre avis, pouvant guérir spontanément et d'autres
     passant probablement non dia- gnostiqués.</p>

    <p>Toxocara canis Urban Rural Fox A dascriptive epidemiological study of adult Toxocara canis
     (Nematoda: Werner, 1782) in the red fox (Vulpes vulpes) has shown that up to 55% and 65% of
     urban and rural foxes respectively, were infected with T. canis in areas of Southern England,
     U.K. Post mortem intestinal examination of about 750 foxes indicates that the prevalence and
     intensity of T. canis in the fox is age/sex related and that seasonal variation in infection
     levels occurs.</p>
    <p>During late spring, when cubs are born, and early summer, up to 100% of urban and rural fox
     cubs are infected, with mean worm intensities of up to 17.9. During the breeding season of the
     fox, in late autumn and the winter months, T. canis is more prevalent in male subadult/adult
     foxes (up to 70%) than in female subadult/adult foxes (45%), but the intensities of infection
     in adults are lower than in the cubs.</p>
    <p>Apart from the successful transmission of T. canis in the fox, studies on the spatial
     distribution of infective eggs in fox faecal samples in urban environments have shown that the
     fox is a major reservoir host in the spread of toxocariasis in the U.K.</p>

    <p>We present results concerning the transmission dynamics of cysticercosis. It has been
     proposed that parasitosis are acquired through the ingestion of post-oncospheres, contained in
     raw or inadequately cooked pork meat. The present study was aimed at confirming this
     transmission mechanism. We studied four batches of pigs treated with cyclophosphamide and
     dexamethasone, used as immunodepressing drugs. Two batches were inoculated with
     post-oncospheres obtained from macerated meat that had been confiscated due to the presence of
     cysticerci; the other two batches were inoculated with macerated pork meat that had been
     infected with T. solium eggs. Post-oncospheres were identified in 100% of the animals and
     cysticerci were found in 30%. The existence of another transmission mechanism is confirmed,
     which depends on an immunodepressing mechanism playing and important role in the installment of
     the disease.</p>

    <p>Communities Surveys Casuistry Fascioliasis Portugal Three communities in the north of
     Portugal were intensively surveyed (Vizela, Amares e Fafe). À total of 6370 persons was
     studied. The global prevalence was 3.2% (207 indivi- duals had eggs of Fasciola hepatica in
     stool), with a mean of 233 eggs/gr of faeces (range 25-2100 eggs/gr). Among the 6370
     individuals studied, 904 were children with ages between 0 and 6 years and 1486 with ages
     between 7 and 13 years. In the first age group we found 21 positives (2.3%) with a mean of
     124.0 eggs/gr of faeces. In the second we found 47 positives (3.2%) with a mean of 220.4
     eggs/gr. In addition, 128 others had se- rological evidence of infection, by indirect
     haemagglutination and immunoelectrophoresis technics. Therefore the global prevalence increased
     from 3.2% to 5.2%.</p>
    <p>The prevalence found in the studied communities are related with the hight percentage of
     infected snails and cattle as well as the water-cress contaminated by the metacercariae in the
     different biotopes of Lymnaea truncatula.</p>
    <p>Together with the 207 case above reported our laboratory has identified between 1970 and 1988
     a total of 977 cases from all over the country. Between 1948 and 1970 only 25 cases were
     reported in Portugal by differents authors. This evidence suggests that fascioliæis is not a
     rare disease in Portugal, as it was formely looked but, in reality, a serious public health
     problem, particulary in the North of Portugal where live 85% of total ca- ses.</p>

     south of Tagus River. Each year between 100 and 150 new cases, as well as, 10 to 15 deaths are
     being recorded. Most of the cysts are loca- ted in liver (70%), only 8.5% in lungs and 6.8% in

    <p>- Aucun animal n'a présenté de troubles cliniques faisant suite à l'infestation ou à la
     réinfestation. Les muscles les plus infestés ont été la langue, les masseters et le diaphragme
     avec un maximum de 58 larves/gramme. On ne constate pas d'augmentation du nombre de larves
     musculaires chez les animaux réinfestés. Les anticorps IgG apparaissent à la 4è semaine après
     l'infestation avec des taux qui varient suivant les animaux, ils ne sont plus mis en évidence
     au-delà de la 27è semaine chez deux animaux. Une remontée d'anticorps est constatée deux
     semaines après la réinfestation à un niveau semblable à celui de l'infestation.</p>
    <p>- Les chevaux développent une résistance à la réinfestation par des larves de T. s. spiralis
     mais qui n'intervient pas dans la survie des larves de primo infestation. La: réinfestation est
     suivie par une augmentation précoce du taux d'anticorps. Compte-tenu de résultats antérieurs,
     il semble que le cheval soit plus réceptif à T.s. spiralis qu'à T. s. nativa.</p>

    <p>24 kinds of nationlities are resided in Yunnan province. The most of them have been living in
     the mountain and poor areas. The many customs of residence, diet and raising swines have been
     formed during historical development. Because some minority nationalities have hobby to eat
     crude pork and do not have custom using lavatiry, the zoonotic parasitoses are caused to be
     epidemic in the areas. The parasitoses included trichineliasis, cysticerciasis, toxo- plasmosis
     and sarocystiasis. The average infective rate that the swines infected Trichinella spiralis was
     0.087% in Yunnan, the infective rate was 3.5% in some areas: from 1960 to 1986 24-time
     trichineliasis for human brought out in Yunnab, human number of this parasitosis was 7,341
     people, 143 of them died, the death rate was 1.95%. The average infective rate of Cys- ticercus
     cellulosae was 0.1% the rate was 3% in some areas, the rate of individual area was 20%; our
     province has 127 counties, 69 counties of them have the epidemic of pork tapeworm, and Occupied
     52.6% of total county number, the infection for human and swine was direct ratio, such as a
     village, the rate for human, swine was 60%, 10% respectively, 14.9% patients suffering from T.
     solium had cysticerciasis. The positive rate for swines infecting Toxoplasma gondii vas 48% in
     our province, the rate in individual area was 66.7%; the positive rate for human vas 3.%, the
     rate was 10.2% in some areas. The four natural villages were investigated, the results showed
     that natural infective rate of Sarocystis suihominis for swine was 72%, the infective rate for
     human intestine was 9.2-62.5%. The paper still proposed some views on the prevention and cure
     of the parasitises.</p>

    <p>CLONING AND SEQUENCING A Leishmania infantum kDNA PROBE FOR DIAGNOSIS PURPOSES: GENBTIC

    <p>J. Alvar, A. Mendoza-Leën and D. C. Barker Molteno Labs. Dept. of Pathology. University of
     Cambridge (UK) Leishmania, kDNA-probe, cloning, sequencing In previous research we isolated a
     440 bp L. infantum kDNA fragment (307/K-1) and charac terized it in terms of specificity and
     sensitivity when being used as a probe. There _ are different situations in which the serology
     and microscopical diagnosis are ineffec- tive. We have now carried out the following strategy:
     cloning the Hae-III1/307 K-1 frag- ment into pUC-18, using Sma-1 and ligation with TA ligase.
     Transformation of competent TG-1 E. coli and clone selection by colony hybridization. The
     specificity and sensiti- vity of each clone was checked by labelling by nick translation and
     hybridization with Hae-IIll/kDNAs of 15 Spanish isolates. The cloned fragment 307/K-1 was
     sequenced by the method of the chain-termination with dideoxynucleotides, using T-7 DNA
     polymerase la- belled with S. The denatured fragment has been sequenced in both directions in
     pre- sence of universal primer.</p>
    <p>No crosshybridization was detected with this L. infantum cloned probe neither with Old or New
     World species. This probe has been able to identify exclusively strains belonging to L.
     donovani sensu lato complex. All cutaneous and visceral stocks iso- lated in Spain from humans
     have been identified as L. infantum. Heterogeneous diges- tion patterns have been demonstrated
     using both the endonuclease Hae-III and hybridi- zation by Southern-blotting. Neither of the
     heterogeneous patterns correlate with geo- graphical nor clinical symptoms from which the
     stocks were isolated. The sensitivity of the clone was checked with pure kDNA establishing that
     a minimum of 1.9 x 109 g of kDNA or, its equivalent, 250 promastigotes are necessary to obtain
     a clear signal by Dot- blotting. In order to increase the sensitivity, experiments using PCR
     are being done.</p>

    <p>Pneumocystis carinii, Pneumocystis pneumonia, monoclonal antibody.</p>
    <p>For the detection of Pneumocystis carinii infection we developed series of monoclonal
     antibodies to human Pneumocystis carinii (PC). For immunization, PC antigen were prepared from
     autopsied lung sample of a patient of PC pneumonia. To detect PC antigen from specimen immuno-
     fluorescence and immunoblotting techniques were used. These antibodies stained both cysts and
     trophozoites with a typical peripheral rim pattern. Diagnostic usefulness was evaluated by
     testing the reactivity of the antibodies to 14 bronchoalveolar larvage (BAL) samples fron AIDS
     patients. First, western blot analyses could detect common anti- genic epitope of 92 KkD.
     Secondly, a few monoclonal antibodies (C5-9, E9) could stain a part of human PCs from all
     isolates (14) by indirect immunofluoresence technique. Ratio of stained PCs to total PCs,
     however, varied among isolates. We also produced monoclonal antibodies to hunan PC by using
     mice immunized with the autopsy sample, and then BAL samples. The monoclonal antibodies from
     some clones (M34-2, M78-1, N23-1) could stain all human PCs from BAL and autopsy. Presently, we
     are staining PC isolates by direct immunofluorescence using these anti- bodies. The results
     suggest that there exists commonly expressed epitope on all human PCs, and the epitope is
     highly important for the diagnosis of PC pneumonea.</p>

     sequences of Trypanosomatidae Protozoa provide a valid support for specific diagnosis when used
     as a probe. Such a tool is necessary to recognize infections due to viscerotropic and/or
     dermotropic strains of Leishmania infantum, with particular reference to human cutaneous
     lesions and phlebotomine sandfly infections. A kKDNA library from a dermotropic L. infantum
     strain was screened through hybridization with total kDNA of different Leishmania species and
     strains. A fragment specific for L.</p>
    <p>infantum was isolated from the recombinant colony and used as a probe against the whole
     genome of Old and New World Leishmania species, including different strains of L.infantum,
     through an in situ hybridization technique (dot blot). The mini-circle fragment showed
     different degrees of hybdridization with L.infantum, being particularly sensitive to the
     dermotropic strains examined, whereas it did not recognize sequences of unrelated species.
     Sequencing and computer sequence data analysis of this kDNA fragment revealed no homologies
     with mini-circles of other Leishmania species. This confirms that our sequence is peculiar of
     L.infantum sensu lato and it beïongs to the variable region of mini-circles. No open reading
     frames were found in the fragment, thus showing no apparent protein coding capacity. Some
     palindromic sequences and small repeated sequence units were detected, suggesting a non casual
     significance of this structure. Our observations suggest that a ‘hot point" for evolutionary

    <p>VIH / Toxoplasmose / moelle osseuse / fièvre prolongée Deux cas de toxoplasmose médullaire
     étaient diagnostiqués chez des patients VIH positifs. Le tableau clinique associait une fièvre
     à 40°C durant plus de trois semaines, des myalgies, une hépatomégalie avec, dans un cas, une
     splénomégalie.</p>
    <p>Le développement d'une pancytopénie avec anémie microcytaire justifiait une ponction de
     moelle, non contributive, et une biopsie médullaire. La présence de foyers de nécrose et de
     granulomes témoignait d'une infection médullaire dans les deux cas; des trophozoites en
     couronne de Toxoplasma gondii dans les mégacaryocytes et quelques histiocytes, étaient mis en
     évidence dans l'une des observations mais la confirmation était apportée dans les deux par
     immuno marquage (réalisé par le Pr Védrelle) à l'aide d'un anticorps polyclonal de lapin anti-
     toxoplasme (généreusement donné par le Pr Tribouley): la richesse des éléments marqués en
     dehors des cellules contrastait avec la difficulté de leur identification par les colorations
     habituelles. Le traitement par pyriméthamine-clindamycine ou pyriméthamine-adiazine faisait
     disparaître la fièvre et corrigeait la pancytopénie en une semaine dans les deux cas.</p>
    <p>Ces deux observations similaires dans leur présentation clinique et histopathologique
     illustrent une cause peu décrite de fièvre prolongée; limmunomarquage est le seul argument
     diagnostic décisif chez l'un d'eux.</p>

     Antigens - antisera - immunodiffusion - immunoadsorption - ELISA - test Immunochemical analysis
     and comparative evaluation of serologic activity of TPE] antigens were carried out. Cyst fluid
     (CF) and extract of membrane (EM) and extract of protoscoleces (EP) of metacestode were
     examined by the methods of immunodiffusion in gel in homo- and heterosy- stems and adsorption
     of heterologous antibodies using hyperimmune sera to each antigen. Serologic activity and
     diagnostic effectiveness of an- tigens were evaluated by the method of ELISA with sera from I5
     piglets infected with I0000 T.hydatigena eggs each. Blood for test. was taken du- ring I20 days
     after Infection. UF had the highest EM-less and EP - least antigenic activity. After adsorption
     of heterologous antibodies in serum against CF antibodies to 3 other components that were
     absent in sera against EM and EP were defined. Antibodies against EM were fully neutra- lized
     by EP and on the contrary; antibodies against these two antigens were absorbed by CF. EP
     demonstrated the best diagnostic properties of ELISA; specific immune response was identify
     with its help. Antipara- sitic antibodies in infected piglets were revealed since the IOth day
     of infection, their highest level was registered on the 24th day, then gradually decreased to
     the end of the experiment (the I20th day) till the level of uninfected control animals.
     Purification of EP with gel- chromatography in TSK-Gel HW-50 showed that not more than 8% of
     protein fractions (molecular mass-til11 400 KkD) had diagnostic value.</p>

     (provided by Dr J. Donelson, Univ. Iowa) was screened with pooled onchocerciasis sera.
     Differential screening with a pool of W.bancrofti sera from Papua New Guinea (provided by Dr K.
     Forsyth PNG Inst. Med. Res.) resulted in a panel of clones only recognised by the anti-0.
     volvulus sera. These clones were screened with individual sera and 22 were not recognised by
     any individual with bancroftian filariasis. Several clones were specifically recognised by
     greater than 90% of the individual ©, volvulus sera tested. A set of these clones have been
     subcloned into the plasmid expression vector PNGS 8+ and the fusion proteins purified and used
     in ELISA. The antibody responses of a group of West African onchocerciasis patients were were
     analysed to two of these peptides. These responses fell into a bimodal distribution, patients
     being high or low responders.</p>
    <p>A tendancy for the antibody titres to reduce with the age of the individual was also noted.
     Patients who had lived in an area where parasite transmission had been interrupted also had
     significantly reduced responses. For diagnostic purposes it was found that the two peptides had
     to be used in combination. With 100% specificitv, only 40% and 74% sensitivity of detection was
     possible when individual peptides were used, whereas in combination 90% sensitivity was
     achieved.</p>

     production of specific IgE to parasitic antigenic determinants and to allergens different from
     those of the infecting agent. We examined two patients affected by Schistosomiasis.</p>
    <p>In their sera total IgE were highly elevated and specific IgE to Schistosoma were detec table
     (RAST class 3 in both cases). Specific IgE to some foods and moulds were determi- ned by RAST
     (Pharmacia A.B., Uppsala, Sweden). In the first serum (8720 of total IgE) we obtained the
     following results: RAST negative for egg white, celery and cladosporium positive for milk
     (class 2), fish cod (1), wheat (2), peas (2), and alternaria (1) In the second serum (total
     IgE= 12032) specific IgE were detectable to milk (class 1), fish cod (2), wheat (2), peas (3),
     celery (2), cladosporium (1) and alternaria (2).</p>
    <p>There were no specific IgE to egg white. Dilution of sera reversed these positive re- sults
     to negative, but didn't effect the positive results to Schistosoma.</p>
    <p>These findings point to a false positivity due to interference by high total IgE levels.</p>

    <p>E.granulosus - Monoclonal antibody- Antigen 5 - Protein epitope - Immunodiagnosis.</p>
    <p>A monoclonal antibody (mAb) designated as EG 02 154/12, specific for the major antigen (Ag 5)
     of Echinococcus granulosus was produced, and used to study the binding sites recognized by anti
     Ag 5 antibodies from patients wWitn hydatid disease. In immunoelectrophoresis, EG 02 154/12 mAb
     gave a single 5recipitin of Ag 5. Western blotting and immunonrecipitation showed that the mAb
     and human hydatid patient sera recognized a major antigen of 64 kDa in sheep hydatid fluid (SHF
     Ag) analyzed in non-reducing conditions Both types of antibodies revealed in reducing
     conditions two components of 37 and 22 kDa. A competition between the mAb and patient sera for
     the same or closely related sites was observed. No such competition was detected with the sera
     from other helminthiasis. Deglycosylation and delipidation of SHF Ag did not affect the mAb
     binding. These results, together with the observation of the immunoprecipitation by the mAb of
     in vitro trans- lation vroducts from protoscoleces messenger RNA, suggest the protein nature of
     the epitope. Thus, this mAb was used to screen a cDNA library constructed in lamda gt 11
     expression vector from E.granulosus protosco- leces mRNA. Fusion protein of one of 13 clones
     selected (Eg 6) was pro- duced and demonstrated to be recognized by 80% of hydatid patient sera
     and by ES 02 154/12 mAb. Nucleotide and amino acid sequences of Eg 6 were determined. The
     definition of the specific epitose is currently under investigation.</p>

     Parasites- Chronic urticaria We examined seventeen patients affected by chronic urticaria. All
     the patients under- went an additives-free diet for at least one month without improvement of
     their symp- toms. Other causes of chronic urticaria were excluded by a wide spectrum of
     physical, serological and radiological tools. In nine patients IgE levels was elevated (5120
     KU/1, 780 KU/1, 770 KU/1, 1020 KU/1, 478 KU/1, 378 KU/1, 393 KU/1, 1300 KU/1, 397 KU/1
     respectively). Because of these data, we investigated for a parasitic infestation, by Ritchie
     and scotch test, as a possible cause of the dermatological picture.</p>
    <p>In all patients, specific serum IgE to Fasciola, Ascaris, Schistosoma and Echinococcus were
     searched for, by RAST (Pharmacia A.B., Uppsala, Sweden).</p>
    <p>Three patients showed positive results to Ascaris, two to Schistosoma and one to Echi-
     nococcus. In all these patients, total IgE level was elevated. It was not possible to detect
     any parasitic infestations by scotch and Ritchie tests.</p>
    <p>Although these last data do not exclude a parasitic infestation, it seems more reasona- ble
     to interprete the results as due to aspecific interference by high total IgE level.</p>

     - Excretory-secretory antigen - Monoclonal antibody Detection of antibodies or antigens in the
     sera of humans or animals infected with T. spiralis is a complex task due to rich antigenic
     composition of parasite which causes development of a whole series of antibodies directed
     towards different epitopes. On the other hand, the likelyhood of associated helminthic
     infections (which becomes a rule in those regions of Yugoslavia which continue with extensive
     mode of livestock production) increases the probability of cross-reacting antigens or
     antibodies. Based on experimen- tal or routine studies of T. spiralis antibody or antigen
     detection in the sera of artificially infected animals and hundreds of naturally infected
     swine, horse and man, as carried out over the past five years, we reached following
     conclusions: The decision to apply specific LIES T. spiralis antigen for the detection of
     antibodies in naturally infected swine in the endemic regions of Yugoslavia proved appropriate.
     In the same time the sensitivity of the test applied for swine antibody detection was high,
     wherebyÿ Micro-ELISA was a test of choice. Detection of specific antibodies in horse also
     requires the application of a highly specific antigen in the sensitive ELISA test. In contrast
     to this,'for serodiagnosis of human trichinosis a highly specific LIES antigen was less
     efficient in the early detection of infection. Owing to this fact whole larvae are used in IFA
     as an antigen. Application of 7C2C5 McAb enabled detection of the presence of LES T. spiralis
     antigens in the sera of the infected humans.</p>

     setting up the PCR for detection of Leishmania infantum in clinical specimens Specific
     sequences of kinetoplast DNA (kKDNA) from this species constitute the target DNA for
     amplification.</p>
    <p>Analysis of kDNA from several isolates of L.infantum shows restriction pattern diffe- rences.
     À library of Hpa II-derived KDNA fragments from one of these isolates was cons- tructed in the
     plasmid Bluescript and fragments able to hybridize with kDNA from all the other isolates were
     selected. Their nucleotide sequences were elucidated and those sequen ces reported to be
     present in all Kinetoplastida were identified. We have selected a 262-nucleotide-long fragment
     lacking those nonspecific sequences as target DNA for ampli- fication and two appropiate
     oligonucleotides have been constructed for use as primers in the PCR.</p>
    <p>Preliminary assays using isolated kDNA from L.infantum are positive, enabling us to detect
     KDNA at picogram levels without hybridization. We are evaluating the sensitivity and the
     feasibility of the method using different types of clinical material. The speci- ficity of the

     Echinococcus multilocularis - monoclonal antibodies - sandwich-ELISA.</p>
    <p>Mouse monoclonal antibodies (MAb) produced against E. multilocularis metacestode somatic
     antigen were produced for their use in a sandwich-ELISA to detect soluble parasite antigens.
     Hybridoma culture super- natants wera screened by ELISA for species- and genus-specificity, and
     two clones of interest were further analyzed: one was of the IgG1-isotype (5/G11) and
     species-specific for E. multilocularis, and another of the IgM-isotype (7/G3) proved to be
     genus-specific for Echinococcus. MAbs were labelled with alkaline phosphatase for the
     elaboration of a double-antibody sandwich-ELISA to detect soluble parasite antigens.</p>
    <p>Titration analysis revealed that the MAb 5/G11-sandwich was able to detect as low as 80 ng of
     E. multi- locularis antigen per ml solution, while the assay with MAb 7/G3-sandwich showed a
     sensitivity of 300 ng E. multilocularis or E. granulosus cyst fluid antigen per mi. MAb 5/G11
     specifically detected antigens from all of 15 E. multilocularis-isolates originating from
     various geographical areas, all the 25 E. granulosus isolates tested remained negative with the
     MAb in question. MAb 7/G3 reacted with antigens from 14 out of 15 E. multilocularis-isolates
     and with 24 from 25 E. granulosus-isolates. Another aspect of interest con- cerned the
     stage-specificity of recognized antigens. MAb 5/G11 as well as MAb7/G3 reacted with soluble
     antigens derived from larval stages (cyst fluid antigens and excretory/secretory product
     antigens from protoscolices of the Echinococcus species in question). The MAbs did not react
     with antigens derived from pre-adult stages (somatic antigens). The combined sandwich-ELISAs
     with the two MAbs described above, are suggested to be of practical diagnostic value and are
     presently being further evaluated. Furthermore, the MAbs were used for purification of the
     corresponding antigens by affinity chromatography, and the charac- terization of the epitopes
     are under investigation.</p>

     quantitate the antigens before,during, and after treatment with prazi- quantel. The third day
     after initiation of treatment there is an elevation in the con- centration of antigen in the
     CSF, followed by a rapid decline. After treatment, the quantitation of antigens can be
     correlated with the clinical and tomographic findings.</p>
    <p>These same two antigens along with four others can also be detected and quantitated in cyst
     fluids obtained by stereotaxic biopsy of T. solium larvae.</p>
    <p>These antigens presented the same pattern as detected by immunoblotting in all the confirmed

    <p>TECHNIQUE FOR THE DETECTION OF CIRCULATING TOXOPLASMA GONDIT ANTIGENS IN MOUSE URINE, Alberto
     Fachado, L. Fonte, L. Rojas, E. Alberti and R. Machfn A simple and rapid staphylococcal
     coagglutination test for the detection of Toxoplasma gondii antigens in mice urine is
     described. À suspension of protein-A containing S. aureus coated with rabbit hyperimmune serum
     was used as reagent. The sensitivity of the antigen assay was found to be at least 118 ng of
     the antigen protein per ml. No coagglutination was observ- ed when the reagent was challenged
     against antigenic solutions of other parasites. The suitability of the method for detecting
     antigens of T. gondii in urine samples was studied by experimental toxoplasma infection in
     mice. Before the staphylococcal test, the urine samples were double serially diluted in 0.1 M
     PBS. From the second day on all samples from infected mice were positive at 1/16 dilution. At
     these dilution, all samples from non infected mice were negative or did not produce
     coagglutination. This method might be used in the rapid etiological diagnosis also in human
     cases of acute toxoplasmosis.</p>

    <p>The inhibitory effects of reagents on exoerythrocytic (EE) development of Plasmodium have in
     the past been assessed either by an indirect method which examines the severity of the
     subsequent blood stage infection or by direct, but laborious, examination of EE stages in liver
     sections by light or electron microscopy. More recently 32P-labelled DNA probes have enabled
     convenient direct quantitation of parasites in rat livers.</p>
    <p>In the present study the effects of various immunological and chemotherapeutic interventions
     on sporozoite-induced infections of P, berghei (ANKA) were compared in C57BL/6 and BALB/c mice
     using 3 different methods of assessment, namely measurement of liver stages using DNA
     hybridization, cspning of blood parasitaemia on Giemsa-stained films and recording of mouse
     survival. We have titrated 102, 10 and 104 sporozoites into C57BL/6 and BALB/c mice under 4
     parameters: 1) after immunization with irradiated sporozoites 2) after exposure to complete
     Freund's adjuvant 3) prior to oral dosage with the novel hydroxynaphthoquinone 566C80 4) no
     treatment (control). Replicate groups of 6 mice were divided in half: 3 mice were sacrificed
     for hepatectomy and the remainder were monitored by Giemsa- stained blood smears from day 4 to
     day 8 after sporozoite inoculation, and subsequently for survival. The respective information
     obtained from the different assays, their relative sensitivities and reproducibility were
     compared.</p>

    <p>Le diagnostic de la toxoplasmose se fait habituellement sur des tests sérologiques, mais pour
     avoir un diagnostic plus précoce et préciser la date exacte de contamination, la detection de
     l'antigène circulant toxoplasmique (Ag C.T.) dans le sérum ou d'autres liquides biologiques
     peut être utile, chez les femmes enceintes ou chez les immunodépri- més. Nous utilisons pour la
     détection de l'Ag C.T. une technique E.L.I.S.A. double sand- wich amplifiée par le système
     Biotine-Streptavidine. Nous avons préparé pour cette détec- tion, un anticorps polyclonal
     antitoxoplasmique, à partir d'un sérum hyperimmum de lapin.</p>
    <p>Nous travaillons sur deux types de souches de Toxoplasma gondii: la souche RH SABIN virulente

     technique de chromatographie sur résine échangeuse d'ions (D.E.A.E.</p>
    <p>TRISACRYL). Nous avons testé la technique sur 32 liquides amniotiques(L.A.) de femmes
     enceintes contaminées pendant leur grossesse, et sur 9 liquides de lavage broncho- alvéolaire
     (L.B.A.) d'immunodéprimés. Les résultats sont positifs pour 12 L.A, et 3 L.B.A.</p>
    <p>La positivité de la méthode pour les liquides amniotiques est intéressante chez la femme
     enceinte qui fait une séroconversion, donnant un résultat plus rapide que celui de l'ino-
     culation à l'animal. Chez les immunodéprimés, les résultats positifs dans les liquides de

     Cysticercosis; Taenia solium; specific diagnosis; antigen genes Cysticercosis is recognized as
     a world-wide zoonosis which causes substantial public health, economic and social problems.
     Here we report the use of recombinant DNA technology as an approach for specific diagnosis of
     Taenia solium cysticercosis.</p>
    <p>We have synthesised cDNA from the metacestode stage of T. solium and cloned it into the EcoRl
     restriction site of the lacZ gene of bacteriophage lambda gtll.</p>
    <p>The cDNA insert sizes of the recombinant clones (107-106 recombinants/library) range between
     150pb-1.5kb. Immunoscreening of the different cDNA libraries using a pre-absorbed pool of human
     cysticercosis sera has resulted in 40 different sera-positive clones, of which at least 13 have
     shown to be T. solium-specific following differential testing against sera from humans infected
     with E. granulosus, E. multilocularis and T. saginata. One of the antigens of T. solium which
     has been used in epidemiological surveys and has shown good specificity is Antigen B. We have
     isolated putatively Antigen B-positive recombinant clones using a pre-absorbed rabbit
     polyclonal antiserum raised against this antigen. Lysogens have been produced from recombinant
     clones and B-galäctosidase fusion-peptides ranging in M, of approximately 135-150 kDa
     identified. The fusion proteins have been shown to be immunogenic against a pool of
     neurocysticercosis patients' sera.</p>
    <p>We have subcloned several of these positive cDNA clones in M13 to obtain sequence information
     with the aim of assigning a possible biological function to the relevant antigens.</p>

     electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) of immuno- precipitates obtained by counterimmunoelectrophoresis
     (CIE) of goat Fasciola hepatica- infected serum.</p>
    <p>A serum with an ELISA optical density value for antigens of 1.035 was screened by CIE and two
     very sharp precipitin lines, named A and B, selected. The portion of agar containing these
     immunoprecipitation lines was excised and exhaustively washed ïin PBS. The agar was homogenized
     and macerated in PBS and used for the immunization of a rabbit and for SDS-PAG analysis.
     Identification of antigen in the immnoprecipitates was assayed by CIE of anti-precipitation
     lines serum against crude extract and Westemm blot. Slab gel electrophoresis was carried out
     under reducing conditions in 12% polyacrylamide gels. Crude extract of F. hepatica adults,
     rabbit IgG and precipitin were run.</p>
    <p>SDS-PAGE of line A showed, apart from IgG light and heavy chains, two polypeptides of about
     85 and 70 kKD. Several faint bands were also present above and below these two bands.
     Precipitin line B showed the same bands except the 70 KD one.</p>
    <p>It is worth noting that antibodies to these two bands are found in experimentally infected
     rabbits and sheep.</p>

    <p>The cloned E. multilocularis DNA probe pAL1 was shown to distinguish E. multilocularis from
     E. granulosus and other cestodes in genomic Southern hybridizations. By similar analysis, pAL1
     also revealed restriction fragment length polymorphisms (RFLPSs) among independent E.
     multilocularis isolates. In order to simplify and improve the sensitivity of the assay through
     the application of the polymerase chain reaction, we determined the complete nucleotide
     sequence of pAL1. Insert-specific oligonucleotides (BG1, BG2, and BG3, all 25mers) were
     synthesized and their specificity verified by Southern analysis of both pAL1 and genomic DNA
     prior to use in PCR. BG1 and BG2 define a 2.5 kilobasepair (kb) fragment in the genomic DNA of
     E.</p>
    <p>multilocularis isolate CH11, while BG1 and BG3 define a 0.3 kb fragment in this isolate. PCR
     was optimized for applied (diagnostic) purposes in control studies using pAL1 and CH11 genomic
     DNA as templates, and then expanded to include 14 independent E. multilocularis isolates, then
     additionally isolates from E.</p>
    <p>granulosus, E. vogeli, Taenia spp. and other cestodes. These investigations revealed that a
     2.5 kb fragment, specific to the addition of BG1 and BG2 in PCR, was amplified from genomic DNA
     of all E. multilocularis isolates tested (originating from Switzerland, Alaska, Canada, France,
     Germany and Japan), but from genomic DNA of none of the other cestode species. Interestingly
     BG1/BG2-PCR revealed a 0.55 kb product with 7. saginata and a 0.6 kb product with 7.
     taeniaeformis genomic DNA. In contrast to the species specificity of the 2.5 kb BG1/BG2
     product, the BG1/BG3 product demostrated genus specificity: a 0.8 kb product, specific to the
     addition of BG1 and-BG3 in PCR, was amplified from genomic DNA of all E.</p>
    <p>multilocularis, E. granulosus and E. vogeli isolates tested, but from genomic DNA of none of
     the other cestode species. PCR was also performed on purified parasite tissue. The diagnostic
     sensitivity of PCR using both primer sets was determined to be 50 pg parasité DNA or 32
     parasite cells, suggesting the practical utility of this simple assay in demonstrating parasite
     DNA in specimens from a variety of sources. At the basic level, the pAL1-derived
     oligonucleotides may also prove useful in assessing strain variation, RFLPSs or other
     manifestations of genetic variation in E. multilocularis.</p>

    <p>La détection des antigènes circulants (AGC) est un des moyens les plus séduisants pour

    <p>Chez les souris OF - 1 inoculées par 5000 trophozoïtes de la souche RH de Toxoplasma gondii
     (T.g.) ou par 200 kystes de la souche kystogène Prugniaud (PGD) de T.g., les AGC sont détectés
     dès le premier jour et durant toute la durée de survie des animaux, à l'aide des techniques
     ELISA - Réverse et Immunoblot. Cette dernière technique a permis d'individualiser 7 AGC de PM
     allant de 22 à 110 KD chez les animaux infestés par la sou- che RH et 3 AGC de PM allant de 75
     à 110 KD chez les animaux infestés par la souche PGD.</p>
    <p>Les trois AGC de haut poids moléculaire (C1 = 110 KD, C2 = 87 KD, et C3 = 75 KD) peuvent être
     considérés comme des AGC majeurs, car ils sont retrouvés tout au long de l'infesta- tion par
     les deux souches de T.g.. Enfin, l'étude comparative par Immunoblot de ces AGC avec des
     extraits cytoplasmique et membranaire de T.g. souche RH, montre qu'ils sont plus d'origine
     cytoplasmique que membranaire. Les techniques d'ELISA - Réverse et d'Immunoblot pourraient donc

    <p>DNA probe - epidemiological tool - Onchocerca volvulus A major problem in the planning and
     monitoring of onchocerciasis control programmes is diagnosing the extent of infection in the
     insect vector. This problem arises from the fact that the vector, blackflies of the genus
     Simulium, is capable of harbouring species of Onchocerca other than O0. volvulus. One approach
     to this problem is to develop and employ specific DNA probes. A genomic DNA library of O0.
     volvulus was thus prepared in the bacteriophage lambda-gt 10 and was differentially screened
     for specific DNA sequences in hybridisation experiments with radiolabelled total DNA from the
     homologous and two heterologous Onchocerca (0. gibsoni, O0. gutturosa) spp. A clone (CIAIl) was
     isolated whose binding to O0. volvulus DNA was at least 50 times stronger than to the other
     parasite DNA samples. The insert of C1Al was subcloned into the vector M13 mp 18 and sequenced.
     Two oligonucleotides, each corresponding to a unique region of 60 nucleotides (out of a total
     of 154) were synthesized and examined for hybridisation with three different georgraphical
     isolates of O0. volvulus (including forest and savannah strains) and six other Onchocerca spp.
     One of the oligonucleotides (C1AIl-2) was found to hybridise to the three O0. volvulus isolates
     with an intensity in the region of 300- fold greater than to any other Onchocerca sp. Since the
     other species include the two which may be most closely related to O0. volvulus - O0. gibsoni
     and 0. ochengi - it is concluded that CIAI1-2 is likely to represent a truly species-specific
     probe. CIAIl-2 has been used to detect infective larvae transferred directly onto
     nitrocellulose membranes. Experiments are currently under way to determine if the radioactive
     indicator system employed in this work can be successfully substituted by non-radio- active
     systems, thus enabling more convenient use of the probe under field conditions.</p>

     probes A mouse monoclonal antibody reactive with a repetitive carbohydrate epitope on
     lentil-lectin adherent glyco- proteins present in the surface and in the secretions of Taenia
     saginata cysticerci, was used in the construc- tion of a diagnostic ELISA assay to detect these
     glycoproteins in the serum of T. saginata infected cattle. Excep- tionally low background ELISA
     values were obtained with sera from animals with a range of commonly occurring tropical
     parasitic infection. Due to a convenient cross reaction the same assay can also be used to
     detect circulat- ing parasite products in Taenia solium cysticercosis of humans and pigs. Two
     DNA probes have been developed using the vector À gt10. The first is specific for T. saginata
     and the second also reacts with T. solium DNA. These two DNA probes potentially allow the
     differentiation of these parasites species, in which the eggs are morpho- logically identical
     and the morphological characteristics of the adult tapeworm proglottids overlap.</p>

    <p>The Luangwa Valley of Zambia is a well established focus of sleeping sickness. Typically, in
     this area sleeping sickness is found with low incidence and the symptoms observed in patients
     are mild. In 1982 as outbreak occurred, with abnormally high incidence, in the small village of
     Kasyasya. In this study we have analysed trypanosome isolates taken from patients and domestic
     animals from this village and compared them, using repetitive DNA probes, with isolates from
     other Foci in Zambia and, in addition, isolates from the major Kenyan and Ugandan Foci. Using a
     repetitive DNA approach, based on Restriction Fragment Length Polymorphisms (RFLPS) in the
     Ribosomal RNA genes, ve hève assessed the relationships between these various isolates. Ye show
     that this outbreak was caused by two groups trypanosomes and that the homogeneity within each
     group suggests a high level of man-fly-man transmission. Ke also show that the goat was a
     reservoir äüin this outbreak. The trypanosome strains responsible for this outbreak were quite
     distinct from those found in other Zambian Foci and the northern Foci in Kenya and Uganda.
     Thus, it is possible that these strains have arisen recently from the background T.brucei
     strains in this area.</p>

     specificity of both assays vras &gt;95%, but their sensitivity was remarkably different. The
     Dot-ELISA could detect as little as 0.055 ng/ml microfilarial antigen added to normal human

    <p>Heartwater, caused by the intracellular rickettsaial parasite Cowdria ruminantium and
     transmitted by Amblyomma ticks, is a serious infectious disesse affecting ruminants in Africa
     and the Caribbean region. In order to improve current diagnostic methods fer heartwater, we
     raised monoclonal antibodies against an immunodominant and conserved 32- kilodalton Cowdria
     protein, which has been previously identified (Jongejan and Thielemans, 1989, Infect, TImmun.,
     57 : 3243-3246). As a next step, a monoclonal antibody-mediated, competitive enzyme-linked
     äimmunosorbent assay for the detection of Gowdria antibodises was developed. Antibodies in
     goat, sheep or cattle sera competed with mutrine monoclonsl antibody (4F10B4) to bind with a
     crude Cowdrina antigen obtaineë by sonication of infected endothelial cell cultures. There was
     a good correlation between results obtained by CELISA and indirect fluorescent antibody test
     with sera from goats or sheep experimentaliy infected with 7 different strains of Cowdria from

     Finally, antibodies to Cowdria were detected in field sera collected from cattle infested by
     Amblyomma variegatum ticks. The CELISA could play an important role in gero- epidemiological

     Postfach 1 1 40 - 3550 Marburg, F.R.G À cDNA library of the coccidian parasite Toxoplasma
     gondii was constructed by using expression vector lambda gtll.Recombinant clones encoding the
     immunogenic T.gondii antigens P36,P66 and P6é8were screened and identified by immunoblotting
     using a rabbit anti-T.gondii serum in conjunction with monospecific sera .To obtain high levels
     of IPTG-inducible synthesis of recombinant proteins a lacz der ivative (lacZ')encoding a
     truncated beta-Galactosidase (beta-Gal') of 375 amino acids was used for the construction of
     gene fusion with the T.gondii cDNA's. The immunoglobulin G (1gG6) and immunoglobulin M (1gM)
     response to the beta-Gal' hybr id proteins r-P35,r-P66 andr-P68 were studied by western blot
     experiments with human sera from acute and chronic stages of T. gondii infection.Both hybrid
     proteins ,r-P 35 and r-P68 predominantly detect specific IgG-antibodies in human serum samples
     from acute and chronic infections. As shown with sequencial samples from a seroconverter
     specific 1gG-antibodies could be detected with r-P 35 14 days following infection. In contrast,
     r-P66 was used to detect specific IgM-antibodies in sera from acute infections.A specific 1g9M
     reactivity with r-P66 was detected as soon as one week after seroconversion . These data
     demonstrate the 2 potential value of all three hybrid proteins as a basis for the development
     of recombinant antigen based diagnostic Kit to detect T.gondii-specific antibodies.</p>

    <p>Cystic hydatidosis, cloned antigens, serodiagnosis An expression library prepared from mRNA
     isolated from Echinococcus granulosus protoscoleces was screened for clones expressing antigens
     recognised by sera from hydatid patients with the aim of using the cloned antigens to improve
     the sensitivity and specificity of serodiagnostic techniques for hydatidosis. cDNA was cloned
     into \gtll and the B-galactosidase fusion proteins assessed in plaque immunoassay. One of the
     thirteen antigens identified has been subcloned into the vector pGEX-1 and the glutathione
     S-transferase fusion protein tested extensively in ELISA. Using native cyst fluid antigens, 72%
     of pre-operative sera from patients with surgically-confirmed hydatid infection gave negative
     reactions. Of these false negative sera, 22% were positive in ELISA with the cloned antigen.
     Sera from patients with protozoan or helminthic infections other than taeniid cestodes did not
     react with the cloned antigen. Although ELISA with cyst fluid antigens showed greater sensi-
     tivity for diagnosis (72% of 83 sera) compared with the cloned antigen (53%), application of
     both antigens achieved a significant improvement in the sensitivity of diagnosis. Addition of
     other cloned antigens may further improve the sensitivity of the assay and provide a practical
     source of antigen for the wide-scale application of hydatid screening in populations at risk of
     infection.</p>

    <p>Definitive diagnosis of cerebral malaria had been problemetic so far. We report here the
     detection of maleria antigen in CSF in 10 clinically suspected patients in 5 of whom
     P.falciparum were also positive in blood smear examination. Pooled positive human serum gamma
     globulin (ELISA OD 2.0) were used for the test. Pooled hormal human serum (ELISA OD {De 3)
     served as a negative control. Saphorose 4B activated by cyanogen bromide and coated with
     P.falciparum. Schizont antigen was used for affinity purification of äntimalerial antibodies
     from the peoled positive human serum gamma globulin. To confirm the CIEOP findingthe CSF
     samples were analysed by Western Blot with the purified antimalerial antibodies. À predominant
     66 KD antigen was detected in all the patients. À low molecular weight 43 KD antigen Was alse
     detected in some cases. Both these band seem to be of plasmodial origin. All 8 patients with
     suspected viral and bacterial encephalitic and 10 normal controls were negative for the antigen
     în the CSF samples. The application of this new technique in the specific diagnosis of cerebral
     malaria will be discussed.</p>

    <p>Pneumocystis carinii, monoclonal antibody It has become accepted that isolates or species of
     Pneumocystis obtained from different host species are not antigenically identical but share
     common antigenic determinants.</p>
    <p>Little information, however, was available on the nature of the Pneumocystis antigens
     involved. We have developed monoclonal antibodies(MAbs) raiïsed against rat, mouse and human
     Pneumocystis (PcR, PcM, and PcH, respectively). The present study using immuno- blot and
     fluorescent antibody techniques with the MAbs allowed the identification of several putative
     Pneumocystis antigens of PcR, PcM, and PcH, and understanding the molecular nature. A MAb 34-4
     rajised against PcR reacted with PcR antigens (120-125 kD and 52-58 kD), and with PcM antigens
     (120-125 kD, 70-75 kD, and 52-58 kD). Another MAb 1E12-8 produced against PcM reacted with PcM
     antigens (120-125 kD, 70-75 kD, and 52-58 kD), and with PcR antigen (62 kD). Double staining
     using MAb 34-4 conjugated with TRITC and MAb 1E12-8 conjugated with FITC showed an interesting
     finding on cross-reactivity between PcR and PcM. Both trophozoïites and cysts of PcM were
     stained with both MAbs 1E12-8 and 34-4. On the other hand, trophozoïtes of PcR were not
     staiïned with MAb 1E12-8 but stained with MAb 34-4, although cysts of PcR were staïned with
     both MAbs 1E12-8 and 34-4. On immunoblotting and IFA, these two MAbs did not react with PcH. On
     the other hand, the majority of MAbs produced against PcH gave strong fluorescence to PcH and
     recognized 92 kD antigen of PcH, but did not react with either PcR or PcM.</p>
    <p>These results indicate that there are shared antigenic determinants between PcR and PcM, but
     their expression on the surface varied among developmental stages or isolates. These also
     suggest that antigen composition of rodent Pneumocystis (PeR and PcM) is much different from
     that of PcH compared with the differences between PcR and PcM.</p>

    <p>NEW TECHNIQUES FOR DIAGNOSIS OF AFRICAN TRYPANOSOMIASIS V.M. Nantulya. International
     Laboratory for Research on Animal Diseases, (ILRAD) P.0. Box 30709, NAIROBI, Kenya African
     trypanosomes; circulating antigens; immunodiagnosis African trypanosomiasis presents special
     problems with regard to diagnosis. The techniques for detection of trypanosomes in host tissues
     are not sensitive enough because parasites are often not detectable in pheripheral blood
     particularly in the chronic phase of the disease. In pursuit of other alternatives, assays have
     been developed that detect trypanosome antigens rather than whole organisms as a means of
     diagnosis. The rationale for this approach is that trypanosomes invade and reside in organ
     tissues where they may be present in large numbers despite their low number or even complete
     absence in peripheral blood. The trypanosomes are destroyed in the organ tissues by the host
     immune response, releasing soluble antigens which can be detected in peripheral blood. The new
     assays are monoclonal antibody-based and they detect species-specific circulating trypanosomal
     antigens in the infected host. The principle of the technique is that micro-ELISA plates or
     polystyrene tubes are coated with trypanosome species-specific monoclonal antibody for capture
     of the antigen from test serum or plasma. The captured antigen is revealed by subsequent
     introduction of the same monoclonal antibody labelled with horseradish peroxidase. The labelled
     antibody will bind to the free epitopes of the trapped antigen, and the bound enzyme conjugate
     revealed by the introduction of substrate and chromogen. The sensitivity of the tests developed
     is of the order of 95% with a speciticity close to 100%, for both animal and human
     trypanosomiasis.</p>
    <p>The results can be read visually, eliminating the need for an ELISA reader, and each
     trypanosome species-specific test can be used for diagnosis of the disease in several host
     species as it does not require use of host species-specific anti-immunoglobulin reagents. In
     animals or humans treated with trypanocidal drugs, the trypanosomal antigens are rapidly
     cleared from circulation. Hence, antigen-detection also provides a potentially useful approach
     for assessing the efficacy of chemotherapy.</p>

    <p>©. volvulus, À. suum, monoclonal antibodies, immunodiagnosis An antigenic fraction of A.suum
     common with O.volvulus demonstrated the ability to discriminate antibodies in patients with
     active onchocerciasis (sensitivity 141/146) from other helminthiasis, including loasis,
     hydatidosis, bancroftiasis and dracunculosis(0/60). This fraction, a 56 KD glycoprotein, was
     used to produce monoclonal antibodies in Balb/C mice.</p>
    <p>Two Mab of the IgG3 subclass were selected by ELISA with total O.volvulus crude extract and
     by immunoblotting against the whole A.suum crude extract. After purification, one Mab (Mc O1)
     was used to detect antigenemia in the sera of the patients with snip-positive onchocerciasis by
     ELISA. Mc O1 gave a positive response in 30/30 individuals(O D &gt; 0,380) but negative
     response with other helminthiasis (O D &lt; 0,100). Using IFI test on the sections of O.</p>
    <p>volvulus microfilariae, Mab Mc Ol recognized an antigenic portion situated just under the
     cuticle.</p>
    <p>118 sera of snip-negative subjects living in an onchocerciasis endemic area of Burkina Faso
     were first tested for the detection of antibodies directed against ©. volvulus. 100 of them
     were positive (84%). 18 negative sera were then tested to detect the presence of O volvulus
     circulating antigens. 10 were positive.</p>
    <p>The use of Mab to detect the circulating antigens in the sera increases the positive rate of
     onchocerciasis among the snip-negative subjects up to 93% and may be of interest for an
     epidemiologic survey in an area where clinical trial of ivermectin has been conducted.</p>

    <p>For the diagnosis of human cysticercosis, most people use crude extracts of the parasi- te,
     which gives high degree of cross-reactions with other helmithiases. The expression of
     eucaryotic genes cloned in Escherichia coli aids the attainment of recombinant fu---
     sion-peptides potentially useful for immunodiagnosis. E. coli Y-1089 was infected with 15
     different strains of the Lambda gtll bacteriophage that contain cDNA sequences from Taenia
     solium cysticerci inserted within the Lac Z gene of their genome. After bacte- rial infection,
     6 lysogenic clones were chosen because of their temperature sensitivity.</p>
    <p>Then, they were induced to produce Beta galactosidase (product of Lac Z gene) and analy sed
     by the enzyme-linked- Immuno electrotransfer blott (EITB) with the use of specific antibodies
     against Beta-galactosidase.</p>
    <p>All the 6 lysogens showed bands of molecular weight higher than the one of Betagalacto-
     sidase. It is suggested that the clones are producing recombinant fusion-peptides. Two of the
     six lysogens presented specific bands when rabbit antibodies against the crude - extract of T.
     soliun cysticerci were used in EITB.</p>
    <p>Actually there are being emploved sera and cerebrospiral fluids from infected hunans to test
     the specificity and sensitivity obtained with each clone for the detection of anti bodies.</p>

     Restriction polymorphism - Weak parasitemia À DNA hybridization test has been developed for the
     screening of falciparum malaria.</p>
    <p>Briefly, two DNA probes, pUF 9 (about 3300 pb) and pUF 28 (1846 pb), have been cloned into
     plasmid pUC 19. They are constituted of highly repeated sequences of 21 bp and are P.
     falciparum specific and ubiquitous : they recognize strains from different geogra- phic origin.
     The restriction polymorphism observed by southern blot among several strains confirm the
     occurrence of important genomic modifications which could be related to phenotypic characters
     of biological relevance. The P. falciparum detection test allows the analysis of 100 samples of
     50 pl of blood in less than 36 h. In addition, the samples treated with the chaotropic agent,
     Cesium Trifluoroacetate, can be stored at room tempe- rature and easily transported. The
     sensitivity of our testsis comparable to that of the thin bloçd film : both pUF 9 and pUF 28
     radiolabeled (- P) DNA probes detect 50 | parasites/mm” of blood, i.e., a 0,001 % parasitemia
     in 50 pl samples after a 24 h exposi- tion. This test is already adapted to control blood in

    <p>In Spain the detection of pig farms infested with 0. erraticus would be of great use for the
     erradication of ASF since the preventive measures against the disease vary according to whether
     the farms habour the para- site or not. For several reasons, it is not possible to obtain such
     information by direct observation of the farms. Our aim in the present work was to check
     whether determination is in fact possible using serology, a method that would provide an
     immediate solution to the problem by using the blood sample today taken from -- all swine to
     discover carriers of ASF virus. In previous works ue have demonstrated that the suine respond -
     to infestation with 0. erraticus by a humoral response. For the desired diagnosis to become a
     reality it was necessary to demonstrate the inexistence of cross-reactions between 0. erraticus
     and other ectoparasite --- affecting swine. To do so, antisera were raised in suine against
     four species of ixodidae, Sarcoptes scabiei, Haematopinus suis and Anopheles atroparvus. The
     reactivity of these sera against antigens from the salivary glands (SGA) of 0. erraticus was
     determined by an indirect and competition ELISA assay. Another way used for studying the
     specifity of the serology was the analysis of suine from farms with/uithout soft ticks to see -
     whether the ELISA results coincided with those observed directly on the farms.</p>
    <p>The results obtained show that the SGA of 0. erraticus are not recognized by heterologous
     sera. Proof of their specificity is also seen in the results of the field assays in which our
     test distinguished perfectly - well between the sera of animals from farms with soft ticks and
     those from farms without them.</p>
    <p>However, in some sera that were negative in the field assays an increase in background
     activity was obser- ved with respect to the negative experimental controls; this makes it
     advisable to fractionate the SGA with a view to removing those fractions responsible for such
     reactivity.</p>

    <p>To improve the ELISA detection method of swine bitten by O0. erraticus, it was conside red
     appropriate to carry out a study of the salivary gland antigens (SGA) of the Argasid with a
     dual pourpose.</p>
    <p>Firstly, to eliminate from the crude extract of SGA the antigens responsible for the increase
     in background reactivity exhibited by some sera from swine that are not bitten by O0.
     erraticus; secondly, to check whether there are antigens specific to the different
     developmental stages of the parasite, in which case it might be more suitable to use a -
     mixture of SGA from several developmental stages in the diagnostic tests instead of SGA from
     adults alone, which are the only ones currently employed. The study was carried out by Western
     blot on the SGA of adults and nymphs 4-5 and on total body extracts of larvae and nymphs 1
     against the following antisera: a)Anti-larvae, nymphs 1 and adults of O. —- erraticus;
     b)Anti-Dermacentor marginatus, Hyalomma lusitanicum, Rhipicephalus bursa, R.</p>
    <p>turanicus, Sarcoptes scabiei, Haematopinus suis and Anopheles atroparvus; c)With sera == from
     swine not bitten by O. erraticus but that gave a high background reactivity with -- the
     ELISA.</p>
    <p>The results obtained indicate that all the stage of 0. erraticus have numerous anti-- gen
     proteins, most with a molecular weight between 18 and 336 kDa. Some of these prote-- ins were
     found to be common to all stages, while others were stage-specific. All those - recognized by

    <p>POLYMERASE CHAIN REACTION OF GENE FRAGMENTS CODING FOR WELL DEFINED P.FALCIPARUM ANTIGENS
     Malaria Research Laboratory,Statens Seruminstitut,Copenhagen,Denmark Polymerase Chain Reaction,
     P.falciparum For the development of a future subunit malaria vaccine, it is important to define
     the occurrence of known B and T cell sites, possible target epitopes for protective immune
     responses, in P.falciparum isolates from areas with intense malaria transmission and high
     immune pressure in the human host.</p>
    <p>The newly developed Polymerase Chain Reaction, PCR, amplifies DNA from even a few copies in a
     sample, and makes it possible to study DNA fragments in small blood samples collected under
     field conditions.</p>
    <p>We have found that DNA purified from P.falciparum isolates adapted to continuous culture, can
     be detected down to a level of 10 copies, and DNA from field isolates of P.falciparum collected
     in Liberia on filter paper, has been detected down to 500 copies.</p>
    <p>Using two allele specific primers from the gp195 (PMMSA) and primers from the conserved
     repeat sequence of GLURP, we tested twelwe P.falciparum isolates from different areas. All
     isolates belonged to one of the two gp195 alleles demonstrating that the isolates were not
     mixtures of parasites carrying each allele. Out of the 12 isolates, 11 belonged to one allelic
     type (P.falciparum isolate MAD20), and only Ki itself belonged to the "K1l'' allelic type,
     which demonstrates that the 2 alleles are not evenly distributed.</p>

     The U.S.A. (1) and France (2) have been in the seventies the first two countries to set up a
     quality assessment in Parasitology. Since few other countries have followed.</p>
    <p>Its organization shows many similarities such as the sending to the clinical laboratories of
     blood parasites, stool specimens, fungal culture and lyophilized sera for titration. Some
     specimens such as P. malariae, Loa loa, D. perstans blood smears have been sent simultaneously
     in the U.S.A. and in France. The results have been very similar, keeping in mind that France
     has very close relations with Loa loa filariasis endemic countries.</p>
    <p>Therefore comparing the feeble results in France obtained with the M.I.F.</p>
    <p>coloration for the trophozoites of amoebae and the better results in U.S.A. using the
     Trichrome permanent stain of Gomori-Wheatley, this latter has been introduced in France, in the
     framework of the quality assessment. The first results are interresting with 55 7% of correct
     answers instead of 22 % initial for trophozoites of E. histolytica.</p>
    <p>The study of the evolution of the results for a same parasite shows a progress in the two
     countries.</p>
    <p>The main goal which is the improvement of the quality of the biological tests seems to have
     been achieved and it is hoped that this quality assessment in parasitology would extend to many
     other countries.</p>

    <p>Babesia equi, Repetitive DNA, Probes, Diagnosis The recognized diagnostic test for equine
     babesiosis, the complement fixation test, is unsatisfactory and cannot be reliably used to
     detect Babesia equi. Tuo DNA probes, pSB20 and pSE2, containing B. equi repetitive sequences
     were evaluated for their ability to detect B. equi parasites in equine blood and in the tick
     vectors. High salt lysates of blood samples were spotted onto Nylon membranes and hybridized to
     random primed-labelled probes SE2 and SB20 (pSB20 and pSE2 insert). These probes were able to
     detect a 0.00016% parasitemia, equivalent to 0.32pg of B. equi DNA. The probes could
     specifically and sensitively monitor the clinical disease. GCenomic DNA from infected ticks,
     Rhipicephalus evertsi evertsi and R. turanicus was EcoRI digested and probed with
     nick-translated pSB20 and PSE2. B. equi DNA could be detected in 50% of the material from a
     single tick vector. Probes pSB20 and pSE2, are more sensitive and specific than the available
     tests and are suitable for use in a diagnostic test for equine babesiosis.</p>

    <p>Serological diagnosis of the disease is indirect and lacks specificity and sensitivity.</p>
    <p>Tuo B. equi-specific repetitive DNA probes, pSB20 and pSE2, cloned into pUC13, were isolated.
     Both hybridized to a specific repetitive band pattern on a EcoRI digest of B. equi genomic DNA.
     Sequencing, subcloning and hybridization were used to identify the repetitive sequence present
     in these two probes. À 16bp degenerate repeat was identified occuring a number of times in both
     pSB20 and pSE2. A synthetic oligonucleo- tide, ESP-1, based on a consensus sequence in pSB20
     and pSE2 could specifically identify the B. equi repetitive band pattern on an EcoRI digest of
     B. equi genomic DNA. This oligonucleotide should be suitable for detection of B. equi in blood

     Trypanosomes, rRNA, sequence, DNA probe The rapid rRNA sequencing method (Qu et al, 1983) was
     applied to investigate the molecular genetic basis of trypanosomes which cause the
     trypanosomiasis of human and domestic animals in developing countries.</p>
    <p>Several rapid divergent domains of 26S rRNA from Trypanosoma evansi and monomorphic T. brucei
     (1.la) were completely sequenced. High homology in nucleotide sequence from the two
     trypanosomes gave a molecular evidence for their very close relationship, but some diferences
     were identified by comparative analysis in a most rapid divergent domain.</p>
    <p>Oligonucleotide probes, based on the molecular diferences among trypa- nosomes, other
     protozoz and mammal hosts, were constructed for the detection on the trypanosomes. The test is
     a most sensitive and selective assey by using of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) proceture and
     the species-specific probe. Therefore it may have medical importance in diagnosis of
     trypanosomiasis and other parasitic protozoan diseases.</p>

     mansoni-Monoclonal antibody-Praziquantel-Blocking antibody À monoclonal mouse antibody of the
     class IgM was raised against an epitope of the gut epithelium of the adult worm.</p>
    <p>It was first applied to the detection of antigen in parasite infections. The antigen was
     found in the urine from mice and hamsters infected with Schistosoma mansoni. After treatment of
     infected mice with Praziquantel, the antigen concentration in the urine decreased slowly in a
     several months duration period before it disappears completely.This phenomenon is probably due
     to the sequestration of the antigen in the liver. The antigen was shown to be Schistosoma
     specific, it was found in different developmental stages of the parasite and high levels were
     detected in egg extracts. The antigen was thermostable, it was not hydrolysed by proteinase K
     but it was destroyed by metaperiodate confirming that it has the structure of a
     polysaccharide.</p>
    <p>On the other end a blocking activity on immunity was shown for the monoclonal antibody under
     study. The inhibitory effect was demonstrated by passive transfer experiments in mice in a
     secondary infection with Schistosoma mansoni and also in primary infection. The results
     indicate that blocking activity could interfer with non specific immunity mechanisms.</p>

     Antigen detection, ELISA Recently, immnological diagnosis of parasitic infections has focused
     on the direct detection of para sitic products in host body fluids and specific detection of
     circulating antigens. These antigen tests have the advantage over antibody detection in that
     antigenemia implies current infection. We have developed several kinds of ELISA for the
     detection of antibodies and antigens in the sera from cattle with experimental fascio- |
     liasis, and in this presentation we compare the results obtained. | Five Holstein calves, 6
     week old, were orally infected with 700 F. hepatica metacercariaæe and bled every 2 weeks
     through 10 weeks of infection. Antigen detection was performed by a double antibody ELISA
     linking to the polystyrene 0,25 pelwell of a rabbit anti- F. hepatica excretory-secretory
     (FhES) IgG. Sera of calves were added and incubated for 3 h and then, wells were incubated with
     0,25 jg or IegG precipitated from Fh infected sheep sera. Finally, a peroxidase labeled
     rabbit-anti sheep IeG (H+L) conjugate was added (1/1000 dilution) and after this the substrate.
     | Circulating antigens were detected in four of the five calves as early as two weeks post
     infection (p.i.) In these four animals, all the sera obtained p.i. were positive for antigen
     and the highest absorbance value (0,%3) was obtained two weeks p.i. The mean absorbance values
     for the normal bovine sera that was 0,310.</p>
    <p>Worm numbers recovered from the negative calf and from the one with the highest absorbance
     value were the | same (27). The worms recovered from the other three were 72,45 and 40. || S8.A

    <p>Easciola hepatica, Monoclonal antibodies We have demonstrated by Western immunoblot that a
     17-kDa Fasciola hepatica excretory-secretory antigen (Fhl7) was an excellent candidate for the
     immunodiagnosis of acute and chronic fascioliasis. Also, this molecule is a reliable indicator
     of chemotherapeutic success. In order to obtain hybridomas producing specific monoclonal
     antibodies against Fh17, we have taken two approaches. In the first, BALB/c mice were immunized
     weekly intraperitoneally (i.p.) 4 times each with 3 pig FhES in adjuvant.</p>
    <p>Three months later they were immunized twice i.p. and later i.v. with 3 ug of a fraction
     obtained by High Perfomance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) using a TSK-250 column and
     corresponding to proteins eluted at the 17 kDa retention time. The spleen cells were removed
     for fusion with Sp2/0 myeloma cells. The fused cells were grown in HAT medium in 96-well plates
     and the supernatant screened by FAST-ELISA for FhES antibody 26 days later. Nine positive wells
     were identified. The antibodies produced were of the IgG and IgM isotypes. By immunoblot all of
     these antibodies recognized a 26-28 KkDa doublet when reacted against FhES suggesting these to
     be dominant immunogens. This doublet is also prominent in SDS-PAGE gels of FhES antigens. | In
     the second, mice were sensitized once with 5 hig FhES followed by three | immunizations with
     the Fh17 fraction obtained by HPLC, the fusions done and the || hybrids grown in HAT medium and
     one week later with growth factor. Screening by FAST-ELISA with FhES and Fh17 was done
     seventeen days later and 18 wells selected for expansion. The antibodies produced were tested
     by immunoblot with FhES and the hybridomas from fifteen of these wells recognized the same
     26-28 kDa doublet. Three other hybridomas recognized several epitopes ranging from 20 to 100
     kDa with one reacting with the Fh17 antigen. These studies suggest that Fh26-28 are an
     immunodominant set of Fasciola antigens whose function in infection as imaunoprophylactic or
     immunodiagnostic agents needs to be defined.</p>

    <p>Pneumocystosis, AIDS, RNA hybridization, immunofluorescence Pneumocystosis is the leading
     cause of death in patients with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). Therefore, early
     diagnosis and treatment of pneumocystosis are of ut- most importance for the survival of AIDS
     patients. Staining with monoclonal antibodies specific for Pneumocystis carinii (PC) is so far
     the most sensitive technique indentify- ing the organism. Molecular biological techniques have
     not been used for this purpose.</p>
    <p>In this study, 18S ribosomal RNA genes were cloned from PC infected tissue from AIDS patients
     and were partially sequenced. A RNA probe was produced and labelled with fluo- rescein or
     rhodamine-X. Fourteen specimens from AIDS patients and 1 from a lung cancer case were tested
     with an in situ hybridization technique. These specimens included 3 trachial aspirates, 2
     bronchoaveolar lavages, 6 sputums and 4 paraffin sections from the lung, spleen, liver and
     lymph node. PC were identified by routine morphologic studies in 7 specimens, including 4
     paraffin sections, 2 trachial aspirates and 1 sputum speci- men. Monoclonal antibody and
     hybridization techniques identified 3 additional cases which had shown PC in previous
     specimens. In addition, one lavage specimen from an AIDS case was positive by hybridization but
     negative by morphology and monoclonal anti- body. The hybridization technique appears to be at
     least as sensitive as that of mono- clonal antibody for identification of PC. Ribosomal RNA is
     more abundant than DNA in organisms, thus RNA probes are theoretically superior to DNA for PC
     identification.</p>
    <p>This technique can be particularly useful in detecting residual PC in cases that have become
     negative by morphologic means and in extrapulmonary infections which usually show atypical
     histology.</p>

     Opisthorchis viverrini Monoclonal antibodies (MAb) against O. viverrini antigens were produced
     in BALB/c mice and characterized by ELISA, radioimmunoprecipitation, immunoblotting and immuno-
     fluorescence. Three groups of MAb were obtained. Group I was specific for the muscle-
     associated 90 kD component. Group II reacted largely with the 16 kD component present only on
     the superficial surface of the tegument and Group III reacted with the 89 kD component found in
     the entire thickness of the tegument, tegumental cells and some secretions. However, all three
     groups of MAb reacted to a varying degree with the para- site eggs. These MAbs were used in the
     ELISA for the detection of parasite antigen present in the bile and feces of infected humans
     and animals at a concentration as low as 5 ng per ml. The method was also useful for the study
     of parasite metabolism in vitro. DNA probes were also constructed from the genomic DNA. One of
     these probes was characterized in more details. DNA sequencing of this probe showed it to
     consist of 340 basepairs and appeared to have neither internal repeats nor opened reading
     frame. It could detect specific 0. viverrini DNA at a level as low as 3 pe. Further testing
     showed that it was possible to detect DNA present in as few as 5 eggs or metacercariae. More
     sensitive method should be developed further and evaluated for its value in the diagnosis of
     opisthorchiasis and epidemiological survey, and as a tool for the study of molecular biology of
     this parasite.</p>

     Participants examine these specimens, identify which parasites are present,and return their
     results. Laboratory performance of participating laboratories is then evaluated and the
     individual laboratory is able to compare its performance with that of the group. Participant
     performance from 1973-1986 in the two programs is compared and changes in performance over time
     are evaluated. For example, in early years (1973-76) an average of 60 % (CAP) and 79 % (CDC) of
     participants correctly identified Giardia lamblia cysts in formalin fixed fecal specimens
     whereas from 1983-86 the figures were 92 % (CAP) and 96 % (CDC). Performance for other

     because T. gondii is obligately intracellular. Hence antigens are always conta- minated with
     the host cells in which the parasite is grown.</p>
    <p>The production of recombinant antigens in bacterial or yeast cells offers a potential for the
     development of highly standardized diagnostic tests with well-defined, repro- ducible, and
     inexpensive antigens. We developed an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) that uses a
     recombinant protein of T. gondii as a diagnostic antigen for the detection of specific
     antibodies in human and murine sera.</p>
    <p>An antigenic portion of the T. gondii nucleoside triphosphate hydrolase (NTPase), which is
     present in the endozoite stage of T. gondii, was expressed in Escherichia coli as a glutathione
     S-transferase (GST) fusion protein with an apparent molecular mass of about 50000. The
     recombinant NTPase detected T. gondii antibodies in mice from 21 to 92 days after oral
     inoculation with T. gondii oocysts. À total of 118 T. gondii positive and 63 negative human
     sera were examined. The ELISA based on the recombinant NTPase showed a sensitivity of 7-14 %
     and a specificity of 92-98 Z in human sera, which was comparable with the specificity observed
     with T. gondii endozoites.</p>
    <p>Advantages and disadvantages that are associated with the use of GST fusion proteins as
     diagnostic antigens in ELISA will be discussed.</p>

    <p>McAb, E. histolytica, Diagnosis, amoebic, antigen Murine monoclonal antibodies against
     Entamoeba histolvtica has been produced. They were applied for typing of pathogenic E.
     histolytica and detection of amoebic antigen in clinical specimens using IFA and ELISA
     respectively. There were four promising McAb (Eh15C7, Eh19C8, Eh35C1 and Eh35C5) which react to
     more than 75% of pathogenic zymodemes and less than 20% of non-pathogenic amoebae or Laredo
     strains. The Eh35C1 and Eh35C5 McAb recognized the same proteins of 183 and 170 kd, whereas the
     molecules recognized by the Eh19C7 and Eh19C8 could not be demonstrated by the Western blot. A
     McAb-based ELISA using McAb 208C2-2 was positive in 23 of 44 stool samples (52.3%) with E,
     histolytica cysts and/or trophozoiïites, whereas only 7 of 47 (14.9%) stool samples with other
     protozoa and/or helminths were positive. A11 30 parasitologically negative individuals ere
     negative. The sensitivity limits of our assay were approximately 110 and 280 amoebae/ml for the

     Publica, Bissau, Guinea-Bissau In order to develop a simple screening test for urinary
     schistosomiasis we used monoclonal antibodies against a cross-reacting S. mansoni 50 kD egg
     glycoprotein (GP 50) to identify parasite antigens in the urine of. S. haematobium
     patients.</p>
    <p>Urines were collected in an endemic area of Guinea-Bissau, the village of Elia.</p>
    <p>The infected urines were dotted onto nitrocellulose paper strips and incubated with the
     monoclonal antibodies. The reactions were developed by adding biotinylated anti-mouse Ig and
     streptavidin-biotinylated horseradish peroxidase complex and finally the substrate and
     diaminobenzidine chromogen.</p>
    <p>The results indicate that S. haematobium derived egg antigens are excreted in the urine. The
     recognized antigens may be released from eggs while present in the urine or they may be present
     in the blood and excreted through the kidneys as described for “gut associated antigens, GAA".
     The results also suggest that an immunological assay for schistosome egg antigens present in
     the urine of infected individuals can be developed for use in epidemiological studies of
     urinary schistosomiasis.</p>

    <p>DNA Probes, Brugia, Parasite identification We have applied the polymerase chain reaction
     (PCR) to the amplification of filarial parasite DNA in human blood samples and mosquitoes.
     Specific oligonucleotide primers have been synthesized based on conserved regions of the Hha I
     repeats we have Cloned from B. pahangi, B. malayi and B. timori. Microfilariae in blood samples
     are lysed by boiling for 15 minutes. A small aliquot of the blood sample (5 ul) is added to a
     100 ul PCR reaction containing the Hha I repeat primers. Following 30 cycles of amplification,
     2 ul of the PCR reactions are spotted onto nitrocellulose filters.</p>
    <p>Mosquitoes are mashed in a lysis buffer and boiled for 15 minutes. Again, a 5 ul aliquot is
     PCR amplified and 2 ul of the PCR reaction is spotted onto nitrocellulose.</p>
    <p>When these samples are hybridized with non-radioactive DNA probes, samples con- taining as
     few as one or two filariae are detected. Biotinylated oligonucleotide probes can give
     species-specific detection of a single parasite in a few hours using avidin- alkaline
     phosphatase detection. Oligonucleotide probes labeled with the enzyme horse- radish peroxidase
     can give the same species-specific detection with less than a 5 minute exposure to x-ray film
     using a chemiluminescent detection System. In a study of 45 human blood samples collected in
     Tanjung Pinang, Indonesia, all 45 were correctly identified using PCR and the non-radioactive
     probes. This method was much faster and more sensitive than using radioactively labeled DNA
     probes to detect unamplified samples. This method is simple and convenient for use in endemic
     nations such as Indonesia and can be carried out without the use of a PCR machine.</p>

     Veterinary Medicine, Virginia Tech, Blacksburg VA 24061 USA Keywords: Giardia - Diagnosis -
     Dogs Although Giardia is a common cause of diarrhea in dogs, controlled experimental studies on
     diagnostic techniques or disease pathogenesis are rare. Diagnosis by veterinary practitioners
     is based primarily on fecal exam and many practitioners rely only on examination of unstained
     direct smears. Zinc sulfate flotation of one or more samples is most often used for recovery of
     cysts. Recently, it has been suggested that examination of endoscopic aspirates of duodenal
     fluid may provide a more accurate diagnosis of infection.</p>
    <p>Ten 6-month-old, Giardia free dogs were infected with 10,000 Giardia cysts isolated from a
     naturally infected dog. An additional four animals were not infected. Feces were collected
     every other day. For the first 8 weeks following infection animals were examined weekly by
     duodenoscopy and colonoscopy and fluid and tissue samples collecteg. Dogs remained clinically
     normal except for softening of stool seen early in infection. Several animals showed mild gross
     lesions on duodenoscopy which disappeared as the infection progressed. No histologic lesions
     were noted. Direct fecal smears were not positive at any time following infection. Cysts were
     present on zinc sulfate flotation from a minimum of 5 days after infection and were
     consistently present in the feces of most dogs until about 8 weeks after infection, after which
     they were present intermittently. Duodenal aspirates were positive during most of the period of
     active cyst shedding. However, late in this period aspirates were negative while cysts were
     still present in at least one of 3 fecal samples collected in the same week. In general, the
     negative duodenal aspirates occurred at the times when cyst numbers were low, suggesting that
     when small numbers of Giardia are present examination of several fecal samples may provide a
     more accurate diagnosis than duodenal aspirate.</p>

     in an endemic area in Portugal. 7 dogs and 1 fox with proven Leishmania infection showed
     positive readings in both assays; titres were &gt; 1:320 in DAT and &gt; 1:128 in IFAT. 22 out
     of 50 serum samples (44%) from dogs (19) and foxes (3) having had no typical symptoms of
     leishmaniasis showed significant titres in DAT (1:320-»&gt;10240) and IFAT (1:128-»&gt;8192).
     Negative DAT (£1:10-160) and IFAT ($1:8-64) titres were found in 17 samples (34%) from 16 dogs
     and 1 fox. The concordance between the two assays in positive and negative samples was 77,8%.
     On the basis of these results and previous study in other L. infantum endemic areas, the

    <p>IF was done using promastigotes in stationary phase and serum samples from healthy
     individuals from non endemic areas compared to patients with cutaneous leishmaniasis: it was
     cross reaction between L. mexicana and serum from individuals of group sanguin- eous B, and in
     less degree with À and O0 type. The same serum samples were also tested by ELISA using a whole
     extract of sonicated promastigotes in stationary phase as antigen. The same cross reactivity
     phenomena was observed. Serum samples from patients with tuberculosis, leprosy, brucelosy,
     siphilis, malaria, Chagas and trichinellosis that have heen reported to cross react with L.
     mexécana were tested by ELISA. AI of them with exception of trichinellosis serum samples showed
     cross reactivity that could be related to their blood antigens, also. Cross reactivity of the
     blood group antigens with L. mex{cana was confirmed by Wester blot using promastigotes in
     stationary phase and tested with comercial standard sera anti-A, anti-B, anti-AB, and anti-D.
     Cross reactivity was observed with ABO antigens only.</p>
    <p>It is evident that for stablishing a good serological diagnostic test for cutaneous

    <p>Hydatid - Bilharzia - Immunoassay - Cross reaction In Iraq , hydatid disease is still a
     public health problem. The rate of prevalence during the early 1980 was 0.4 % or four per 1000
     patients admitted . 100 sera of surgically proved hydatid patients, 20 sera of patients
     infected with diseases other than hydatid, and 25 sera from healthy individuals were tested by
     thin layer immunoassay ( TIN ).</p>
    <p>Antigens from human or animal hydatid with various concentrations were used for coating the
     plastic plates .</p>
    <p>The test gave a high degree of sensitivity ( 90 % ) . Cross reactivity was noted with some
     sera , but it was seen most with patients infected with Schistosoma hematobium . The antigen
     obtained from liver cyst was more active and better antigen than the ones obtained from spleen
     , or lung cysts of human . And because of its high sensitivity , ease of its performance , and
     low cost , this test could be recommended for diagnosis of human hydatidosis after careful
     assessment and evaluation, 944 S8.B - Méthodes immunologiques.</p>

     antibodies - encephalitis - HIV patients Toxoplasmic encephalitis is the most common
     opportunist infection involving the central nervous system (CNS) in AIDS patients. In order to
     assess the prevalence of toxoplasmosis in HIV-infected people a serological survey was
     performed in 190 individuals (97 assymptomatic carriers, 23 AIDS related complex and 70 AIDS
     patients).</p>
    <p>One hundred thirty two (69.57%) were positive by direct agglutination measuring IgeG
     toxoplasma antibody and no specific IgM could be detected by the indirect immuno- fluorescent
     test. No difference between age groups or risk groups for HIV infection vas recorded. There was
     either no significant difference between this prevalence and one observed previously in a
     healthy population with the same age range.</p>
    <p>In the HIV-infected group with toxoplasma antibodies, sixty four (48.47) had titers higher
     than 160 iu/ml and sixteen (12.14) of 4000 iu/ml or higher.</p>
    <p>Twenty five (35.74) of seventy AIDS patients developed toxoplasmic encephalitis. With one
     exception, all of them had toxoplasma antibodies, seventeen (70.87) with titers higher than 160
     iu/ml and seven (29.17%) of 4000 iu/ml or higher.</p>
    <p>The results of this study suggest that, in AIDS patients, toxoplasmic encephalitis occurs
     usually with high titers of toxoplasma-specific antibody although it can arise with low titers
     or even in the absence of detectable toxoplasma antibody.</p>

     Toxoplasmose, Anticorps IgM et IgA, Antigènes, Diagnostic Dans la toxoplasmose acquise et
     congénitale la présence d'IgM est recherchée comme preuve d'une infection récente. Les IgA
     peuvent être un critère complémentaire, La production et la cinétique des anticorps IgM et IgA
     ont été étudiées et leurs intérêts respectifs évalués pour le diagnostic. 300 sérums de sujets
     atteints de toxoplasmose acquise et 100 de sujets témoins, ainsi que les sérums de 40 nouveau-
     nés atteints de toxoplasmose congénitale et de 50 enfants non infectés ont été analysés.</p>
    <p>La méthodologie retenue pour la détection des IgA est la technique ISAGA, immunosorbent
     agglutination assay, du fait de sa sensibilité dans la détection des IgM. Dans la toxoplasmose
     acquise les IgA sont présentes durant une brève période qui correspond à la phase aigue
     contrairement à ce qui est observé pour les IgM qui sont détectées plus longtemps, parfois même
     au stade d'immunité ancienne. La technique est spécifique.</p>
    <p>Les résultats faussement positifs dans la détection des IgM avec certains tests dus à des
     anticorps naturels ne sont pas observés avec la technique IgA ISAGA. Dans les toxoplasmoses
     congénitales les anticorps IgA sont détectés dès la naissance. Ils ne sont pas constamment
     associés aux IgM spécifiques. 50 % des sérums de nouveau-nés avec des IgA contiennent des IgM.
     Les sérums de nouveau-nés avec la seule présence d'IgA correspondent à des contaminations
     maternelles du ler et 2e trimestre de la grossesse. Par la technique d'immunoblotting il a été
     possible de caractériser les composants antigéniques spécifiques des IgA et des IgM. En
     conclusion la recherche des IgA s'avère complémentaire de celle des IgM. La présence d'IgA
     permet de conclure à une infection acquise ou congénitale récente en cours d'évolution ce qui
     améliore le diagnostic sérologique.</p>

    <p>Toxoplasmosis - Diagnosis - Western-blotting.</p>
    <p>130 sera were tested. These sera come from 105 patients, whose clinical and serological data
     were wellknown. They are divided in acute and chronic toxoplasmosis. All these sera were tested
     with immunofluorescence, immunoenzymology and immuno-western-blotting (IWB) for the detection
     of IgG and IgM toxoplasmic antibodies.</p>
    <p>In acute toxoplasmosis, tests devoted to toxoplasma membrane were positive.</p>
    <p>Effectively the first antigens detected by IWB are the 21, 24, 27, 32, 35, 40 kDa both by IgG
     and IgM. Further 50 and 60 kDa antigens are recognized.</p>
    <p>In chronic phase more than 15 bands are recognized from 14 KkDa to 170 KDa.</p>
    <p>After one year post-infection, some antigens are still recognized. It is so for the 24, 27,
     32, 35, 40 and the 50, 60 kDa, both for IgG and IgM. But the 21 kDa is no more detected by IgM
     in this chronic phase.</p>
    <p>Immuno-western-blotting is a very good analytical technique but too complex and too avid of
     antigen for a routine use. Nevertheless, we have using this technique for resolving the
     diagnosis of complicated cases, waiting for a simplification of the technique.</p>

     Recombinant antigen, ELISA Native antigen preparations derived from infected host blood have
     been used widely for the sero-diagnosis of Babesia infections. However, due to inherent
     drawbacks of these antigens, e. g. large batch-to-batch variation, the use of highly definend
     recombinant antigens would be desirable. We evaluated the suitability of a single, highly
     defined recombinant protein expressed in Escherichia coli as an ELISA antigen.</p>
    <p>When the highly purified recombinant antigen and native antigen derived from infected bovine
     erythrocytes were compared under optimised conditions the assays agreed to 93 % (280/300). À
     few infected cattle were positive by one of the assays only indicating that a small number of
     false negative reactions were obtained with either of the assays.</p>
    <p>Titres for individual sera were calculated using the computer-based "Kinetics-Linked
     Immunosorbent Assay Program". Statistically only moderate agreement between the absolute titres
     obtained with the two assays was observed (r2=0.62, n=163).</p>
    <p>We demonstrated that a single recombinant antigen can be used success- fully for the
     serodiagnosis of B. bovis. It can replace the native antigen for epidemiological and other
     studies if a qualitative result is desired. Employment of a pool of two or more recombinant
     antigens representing a larger part of the total babesial protein may lead to better agreement
     with the ELISA performed with native antigen.</p>

     HYPODERHOSIS C. Boulard, C. Villejoubert, N. Chabaudie Hypodermosis, diagnosis, immunological
     survey, ELISA Hypodermin €, a collagenolytic enzyme secreted by Hypoderma lineatum and bovis
     larvae, has been characterized as a specific antigen for early hypodermosis immunological
     diagnosis (Boulard, 1970). This antigen has been used in different immunological techniques
     (immunodiffusion technique, hemagglutination, ELISAi for various purposes, individual diagnosis
     (for human, cattle, horse) or early evaluation of chimioprophylaxis. In 1981, a serological
     diagnosis using this antigen as introduced in France in à departemental imunological survey to
     monitore an hypodermosis control program. This procedure was then extended to national
     eradication programs in France and U.K. To limit the cost of the survey, a sampling method was
     proposed (Burillon and liessean 1982). In this study the detection of specific antibodies has
     been carried out using an ELISA technic (Boulard 85). Sera and milks (for dairy cows) were
     collected monthly troughout the course of natural infestations. The kinetic development of
     antibodies after hypodermosis treatments was also monitored. The sensitivity of the technic has
     been evaluated on a herd basis, on pooled milks and pooled sera, as the herd is the
     epidemiological unit. These results suggested that the ideal period for collecting samples
     extendes from December to Harch, that specific antibodies can be accurately detected in mixed
     milks in the farm tank where infestation is medium or heavy. In dairy herd with less than 5 %
     infested animais and in meat herds, antibodies are easily identified on pool of 10 sera. The
     value of ELISA for monitoring hypodermosis incidence is definitively more accute and requires
     less manpower than à parasitological survey.</p>

     France Latex Echinococcosis Echinococcosis is a widely spread disease and its diagnosis is
     sometimes difficult. Several immunological tests are often necessary to assess the disease. The
     aim of this work was the study of a new latex agglutination test (Latex Color Hyda SIRIBIO-TECH
     Laboratory).</p>
    <p>97 sera have been assayed by the following methods : indirect haemagglutination (IHA),
     Counter immuno-electrophoresis (CIEP) and Latex agglutination (LA). Significant titers for
     these methods are respectively : 1/256è (IHA), 1 line (CIEP) and 1/3 (LA). 49 sera Of patients
     with confirmed echinococcosis, 17 CIEP-positive sera and 31 negative controls have been tested
     (Total 97 sera). No false positive (cross raction) were reported, but some false negative : 6
     (11%) by LA and 8 (15%) by IHA have been observed. It is interesting to notice that 17
     CIEP-positive sera (weak line) giving a low titer by IHA (&lt;1/28) were found negative by LA.
     There is a good correlation between IHA abd LA results, So the combina- tion CIEP/LA is very
     useful; furthermore, LA is a very easy to perform technique. In case of distorsion, IHA can be
     used.</p>

     crude E.m and specific Enm2 antigens. Among the 4 482 subjects included in the study, 99 with
     positive tests were submitted to a clinical, biological and ultrasonographic (US) examination.
     In vitro proliferation of peripheral blood lymphocytes against E.n antigens was measured in 65
     among these 99 subjects. Results of the ELISA were higher than mean +35) and mean +25D of the
     control values in 18 and 81 subjects respectively. Hepatic lesions of AE were diclosed in 9
     patients including 5 "active" and 4 “Mabortive" forms of the disease. Diagnosis was confirmed
     by a surgical operation in 4 patients with active lesions. À specific sensitization of
     lymphocytes against E.m was observed in 6/7 patients with AE and in 50 % of the "positive"
     subjects (Vs 10 % in "negative" subjects of the same endemic area).</p>
    <p>These results indicate that the prevalence of AE is 0.2 % in this population; they suggest
     that "positive" subjects of the screening program could have a previous contact with the

     understanding the exact role of this antibody class in these infections is not easy.</p>
    <p>We compared two E.L.I.S.A. methods: a) the indirect and b) an amplified (with 3 antibodies)
     methods to detect specific IgE in human infections from two nematodes, Trichinella sp.3 and
     Toxocara canis.</p>
    <p>We evaluated sera from 125 trichinellosis patients and 97 patients affected by Visceral or
     Ocular Larva Migrans syndrome; the diagnosis was ascertained on the basis of clinical and
     serological parameters. We used 80 and 43 sera respectively from atopic subjects, blood donors
     and patients with other infectious diseases, as controls.</p>
    <p>The results show that in trichinellosis sera while the indirect method gave a 3.2% specific
     IgE positivity rate, the amplified method gave 64% positivity. No control serum resulted
     positive with both tests. In T.</p>
    <p>canis infection sera the 5% positivity using the indirect method passed to 81% with the
     amplified one. Again no control serum was positive in both tests.</p>

    <p>Trichinella spiralis; muscle larvae antigens; human infection;diagnosis.</p>
    <p>In Mexico, as in other countries, human trichinellosis is still a significant public health
     problem. The diagnosis of this disease requieres the use of purified and charac- terized
     antigens that improve specificity and sensitivity of the assays. In this work we have
     identified antigens of Trichinella spiralis muscle larvae recognized by serum samples from
     humans with trichinellosis living in the State of Mexico. This was ap-- proached by the use of
     ELISA and Western blot analysis using whole parasite extracts.</p>
    <p>Serum samples were collected approximately 5 weeks post-infection from patients with
     symptomatic trichinellosis who showed either positive T. spiralis biopsy or high OD - values in
     ELISA. Control serum samples were from asymptomatical individual living in the same geographic
     area and from individuals infected with other intestinal parasites.</p>
    <p>The most frequently recognized antigens by all serum samples tested, had a MW of 98, 67, 63,
     55 and 47 Kd. When monospecific reagents were used in Western blot æamalyses a highest
     reactivity to these parasite components was found to be of the IgM isotype.</p>
    <p>Based on the patterns of antigenic recognition observed, muscle larvae antigens with MW of 43
     and 47 Kd were purified from SDS-PAGE of whole parasite extract. These anti gens as well as
     total soluble extracts were evaluated by ELISA for detection of T. spiralis infection in serum
     samples from several human outbreaks of trichinellosis. Control serum samples were as described
     above. Although both antigenic preparations allowed the dis- tinction between positive and
     negative serum samples the fraction containig the two -- antigens of 43 and 47 Kd increased the
     specificity of ELISA for some serum samples. -- These results suggest that the purified
     antigens can be useful in the improvement of - T. spiralis diagnosis in humans. Supported by a

    <p>Trichinella spiralis; adult worm antigens; human infection; diagnosis.</p>
    <p>Diagnosis of human trichinellosis requires the identification of specific antigens of all
     parasite stages that are recognized during infection. In this work, we performed a longitudinal
     study in human infected with T. spiralis to identify adult parasite _—— antigens recognized
     during infection. This was approached by the use of ELISA and Western blot. Serum samples were
     collected from human infected during an outbreak of trichinellosis in Toluca, State of Mexico,
     at different times after infection for a period of one year.</p>
    <p>14 samples were from patients with a positive biopsy and 3 from individuals with a _—
     negative biopsy. Control sera were from asymptomatic individuals living in the same --
     geographic area and from individuals infected with other intestinal parasites. Antibodies to T.
     spiralis adult worms determined by ELISA were found in individuals with positive or negative
     biopsy by week 3 post-infection and were still detectable in some patients after a year of
     infection. Western blot analysis revealed recognition of several parasite components by
     antibodies present in both groups. Of these, the most frequently detected antigens had a M. W.
     of 34, 44, 53, 67, 76 and 104 Kd. Recognition of these components varied during infection, was
     more marked by week 5 and 7 post-infection and decreased after a year. Control serum samples
     showed negative values by both ELISA and Westerm-- blot except for an individual infected with
     Ascaris lumbricoides who recognized an -- antigen with a M. W. of 94 KD. These results suggest
     that the identified adult parasite antigens are useful in the design of more reliable and
     complete diagnostic methods for human trichinellosis.</p>

     Microprecipitation - Toxocariosis There is a great variability among the criteria used to
     assess the anti-Toxocara antibody response measured by ELISA.We used in our experiments the
     Diagnostic Index(DI)established as the ratio between the optical density(OD)of test sera and
     the OD of negative control.</p>
    <p>At present,values of &gt; 3 are considered positive;2-3,borderline and &lt;
     2,negative(Guillén et al. 1986).In this paper,results obtained by ELISA and expressed as DI
     were compared with those obtained by larval microprecipitation test in searching for specific
     anti- Toxocara antibodies in sera from patients with clinical suspicion of visceral larva mi-
     grans{VLM).The later technique demonstrated high specificity and it is commonly used in the
     diagnosis of VLM(Olson, 1960).</p>
    <p>Among 94 sera tested,10 were negative to both techniques.</p>
    <p>Fifty-nine samples were borderline by ELISA,58 out of these 59 were negative by micropre-
     cipitation test while the last one resulted weakly positive(48 hours).</p>
    <p>Among the remainder 25 sera,21 were. strongly positive(DI &gt; 3)by ELISA and only 2 out of
     these 21 sera were negative to microprecipitation test.The last 4 sera(DI = 3)were nega- tive
     by microprecipitation test.</p>
    <p>These results seem to confirm the capacity of DI to discriminate in human toxocaricsis.</p>
    <p>Positiveness criterium could be established from 3 value onward;values considered border-
     line(2-3)have been confirmed as negative.</p>
    <p>We consider that patients with clinical suspicion of VLM and sera DI values of 3 or near

     du patient (avec ou sans SIDA).Chez les malades nonimmunosupprimés l'infection se traduit par
     des titres pa- thologiques élevés lors des réactions suivantes:Fixation du complément(KBR)
     immunofluorescence (IFT),agglutination avec "TOXO-SCREEN DA" et"TOXO-ZELL- AD", alors que chez
     les malades porteurs du SIDA seule l’agglutination a- vec "TOXO-SCREEN DA" se montre
     pathologique.L”infection,due au toxoplasma gondii lors d’immunodéficience (SIDA),semble
     dissoçier la réactivite des anticorps IgG plutôt qualitativement que quantitativement.Chez les
     mala- des avec SIDA,la cinétique des IgG mesurés avec le "TOXO-SCREEN DA" cor- respond au

     P30, immunocapture, congenital toxoplasmosis, fetuses In this work, we evaluate the
     performances of Platelia-Toxo IgA kit (Diagnostics Pasteur, France). This new enzyme
     immunocapture test aimed at detecting specific IgA antibodies directed against a major
     Toxoplasma gondii surface protein of molecular weight 30 kD (P30) was derived from a previous
     work (Decoster et al, Lancet, 1988).</p>
    <p>Ye analyzed 396 sera : 108 from women infected during pregnancy, 112 collected in utero from
     their fetuses, 25 from congenitally infected children, 47 from healthy newborns, 16 from
     seronegative patients, 43 from chronically infected patients and 56 from patients during the
     acute phase of acquired toxoplasmosis.</p>
    <p>In acquired toxoplasmosis, IgA against P30 were detected in sera of all patients during the
     acute phase of infection (up to 6 to 8 months after infection) but not in the chronic phase,
     whereas specific IgM could still be detected ("residual" IgM). No false positivities due to the
     presence of antinuclear antibodies or rheumatoïd factor were observed. In congenital
     toxoplasmosis, IgA against P30 were evidenced more frequently than specific IgM antibodies in
     infected newborns and fetuses and no uninfected newborn was positive for IgA.</p>
    <p>Platelia-Toxo IgA is a very simple and sensitive immunocapture assay aimed at detecting
     anti-P30 IgA antibodies. It has proven very reliable and of great help to diagnose a recently
     acquired toxoplasmosis, that is important for a better management of the pregnancies, and to
     detect a congenital toxoplasmosis in newborns or in utero in fetuses.</p>

    <p>Adult worm antigens are used to detect anti Schistosoma antibodies.Results are satisfying
     with S. mansoni, (homologous antigen), poor for S. haemato- bium and bad for S.
     intercalatum.</p>
    <p>In this study, 3 antigens of S. mansoni were tested, one produced from the adult worm and the
     others from eggs at different concentrations, in order to evaluate the efficiency of passive
     hemagglutination in the diagnosis of schistosomiasis not for S. mansoni which gives satisfying
     result but for S. haematobium and especially S. intercalatum (heterologous antigen). Sera
     obtained from patients who excreted eggs were tested in C.H.U. of Yaounde with the 3 antigens
     and the same cryopreserved sera were tested in France, to evaluate a potential decrease of
     antigen quality due to transport and conservation under tropical conditions. Negative control
     sera and other helminthic infected patients were tested. Hemagglutination diagnosis value
     varies from 65% to 90%, depending on the antigen.</p>
    <p>Cross reactions are lower than 1/80 and disappear with an increase of the antigen egg
     concentration. Concerning S.intercalatum, the sensitivity is 60% with egg antigen and is lower
     than 10% with adult worm antigen. There is no significative difference between tests made in
     Cameroon and in France. On comparing this technic to the classical hemagglutination it is more
     sensitive with geometric means of 106,4 and 192 with respect to 76,6 for the method using an
     adult worm antigen.</p>

     falciparum, fusion protein, ELISA, glutamate rich protein À gene encoding a protein of interest
     as a potential component of a vaccine against Plasmodium falciparum has been cloned. This
     glutamate rich protein (GLURP) is present on segmented schizonts and is liberated to the
     supernatant of in vitro culture.</p>
    <p>An ELISA was developed to study the humoral immune response to this protein. The antigen was
     produced as a fusion protein in E.coli.</p>
    <p>Most donor sera (98%) from a malaria endemic area in Liberia contained antibodies against the
     fusion protein, whereas no antibodies were detected in sera from Danish individuals.</p>
    <p>The E.coli fusion protein contains 57% non-malaria protein from E.coli B- galactosidase. No
     antibodies against this part of the fusion protein were detected.</p>
    <p>The assay is performed in a few hours with a minimum of preparation of each sample and with
     standard techniques.</p>
    <p>This ELISA is suitable for sero-epidemiological field surveys aimed at studying the
     correlation between possession of antibodies against GLURP and clinical immunity towards
     P.falciparum.</p>

     response to Pneumcystis carinii (PC) as mesured by indirect IF in AIDS patients to other
     immunosupréssed patients with organism proven PC pneumonia (PCP).</p>
    <p>Patients: Sera were available from 57 AIDS patients and 38 otherwise immunosupressed patients
     (transplant recipients, leukemia patients etc) with positive PC detection in bronchoalveolar
     lavage (BAL) or sputum . Sera from 80 HIV infected patients with lymfadenopathia, 54
     immunosuppressed non HIV patients with other pneumonias, 60 immunocompetent patients with
     pneumonia and 127 healthy Swedes served as controls.</p>
    <p>Indirect IF: Paraffin sections of PC infected human lungtissue was used as antigen. Sera
     giving a bright fluorescensce in dilutions 21/10 were regarded as positiv Results: In the
     "acute sera" seropositivity to PC was seen in about 20% of both HIV patients and other
     immunosuppressed patients with or withoute PCP. Healthy blood donors and "normal" pneumonia
     patients were seropositive in 3% and 2 %. In “coupled sera" a seroconversion or a four fold
     rise in titers were seen in 8/21 (38%) of non HIV immunosuppressed PCP patients it contrast 10

    <p>Neurocysticercosis-saliva-serum-ETA-ETTB.</p>
    <p>The enzyme immunoassay (EIA) standarized with a crude extract and the enzyme- linked
     immunoelectrotransfer blot assay (EITB) with glycoprotein antigens were compared by using
     saliva and serum in the search for specific antibodies against Taenia solium larvae, for the
     diagnosis of neurocysticercosis. Saliva was significantly more sensitive in EIA (82.1%) as
     compared with serum (74.1%). In EITB serum was far more sensitive (100%) than saliva (70.4).
     The use of EITB with serum is thus an excellent choice for diagnosis of clinical cases of
     neurocysticercosis, while EIA using saliva represents a useful combination for diagnosis and
     especially so for epidemilogy, because saliva is obtained easier, with a painless and
     non-invasive procedure while EIA is a simpler technique to perform. Furthermore, cross
     reactivity of EIA with Echinococcus does not interfere in countries like Mexico where human
     hydatid disease is absent.</p>

    <p>The SUP antigens sensitize the activated latex particles and the inactivation of the

    <p>The SUP antigen was active only in the latex, CFT and inhibition of the IHA tests.</p>
    <p>The SOM antigen does not sensitize the latex particles however it was active in all of the

     Marshall W. Lightowiers and Michael D. Rickard University of Melboume, Veterinary Clinical
     Centre, Princes Highway, Werribee 3030, Australia Specific diagnosis of E. granulosus infection
     in the dog plays a central role in hydatid control schemes aimed at preventing transmission of
     infection from dog to human. The only diagnostic technique used on a large scale has been to
     purge dogs with arecoline hydrobromide and examine purge samples for E. granulosus worms. The
     technique has several serious disadvantages (poor sensitivity, risk of hydatid infection to
     humans and drastic side-effects of arecoline in some dogs). Its value is further diminished
     because a highly effective cestocide (praziquantel) has become available to the public. This
     means that dog owners can treat their dogs to eliminate E.</p>
    <p>granulosus worms before presenting them to control authorities for arecoline testing. Because
     of this, there has been a strong need to develop an alternative and practical diagnostic test
     for application in hydatid control or eradication schemes.</p>
    <p>An enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) using E. granulosus protoscolex or oncosphere
     antigens was developed for diagnosis of naturally acquired E. granulosus infection in dogs. À
     total of 204 dog sera were tested. The ELISA using protoscolex antigen had a sensitivity of
     73.2% for specific detection of infected dogs. This degree of sensitivity compared favourably
     with arecoline testing. Stage and species specific anti-oncosphere antibodies were detected in
     infected dogs. There was no correlation between anti-E. ganulosus antibody levels and E.
     granulosus worm burdens. Serological screening in an endemic hydatid region detected 7.T% of
     farm dogs found ‘negative’ by arecoline testing.</p>
    <p>These results clearly demonstrated the potential of a diagnostic ELISA test for serological
     screening of dogs for ‘existing or ‘recent past E. granulosus infections. Further studies
     should identify additional recombinant antigens and test 10P1 expressed in alternative
     expression systems to achieve increased diagnostic sensitivity of an ELISA for wide-spread
     application in hydatid control and eradication schemes.</p>

    <p>The imnunological study of the different isolates of a parasite can show the existence of
     shared epitopes, likely to be used as protecting antigens and diagnostic probes, and can also
     lead to establish differences of interest in speciation.</p>
    <p>L1 larval extracts of four Trichinella isolates: T. spiralis (LASO LH-59), T.</p>
    <p>pseudospiralis (Garkavi), T. nativa (Boev) and T. nelsoni (C-76) were compared by
     double-antibody micro-ELTSA and Western blot, using a monoclonal antibody (ES/TA2) developed
     against excretory-secretory products of T. spiralis.</p>
    <p>In the micro-ELISA test, only T. pseudospiralis differs antigenically from the other
     isolates. By Western blot analysis, ES/TA2 recognises two bands (70 and 92 kD) common to the
     four isolates and three (45, 48 and 68) common to T. spiralis, T. nativa and T. nelsoni. À 38
     and a 72 KD peptides were specific for T. pseudo- spiralis, and a 105 KD band was only present
     in T. nelsoni extracts. T. spiralis and T. nativa patterns were indistinguishable.</p>
    <p>These data have allowed us to establish three differentiated groups: T. pseudo- spiralis; T.
     nelsoni; and T. spiralis and T. nativa. This arrangement is similar to those proposed by other

    <p>Toxoplasma gondii, antigen Purpose: To identify relevant antigens for diagnosis of ongoing
     Toxoplasma gondii infection Materials and methods: Sera from patients with clinically manifest
     infection and seropositive cases without evidence for recent infection as determined by
     standard serological assays were used.</p>
    <p>Antigenic material to be fractionated consisted of toxoplasma trophozoites which were
     freeze-thawed in the presence of detergent (Nonidet P-40) and centrifugated at 100.000g for 1h.
     Soluble antigens in the supernatant were separated using ion- exchange chromatography and
     chromatofocusing. Patient sera were tested for activity against the different fractions,
     separated by PAGE/SDS gel-electrophoresis, using immunoblotting.</p>
    <p>Results and conclusions: Presence of antibodies to a low molecular weight component isolated
     by ion exchange chromatography and chromatofocusing could be detected in sera from patients
     with acute or recent infections.</p>

    <p>Leishmaniasis; Kala-azar; Immunodiagnosis; ELISA; CIEP.</p>
    <p>Diagnosis of kala-azar (visceral leishmaniasis) by a sensitive and specific test is very much
     needed, particularly during the early phase of infection. Sera from 70 Indian kala-azar (KA)
     and 27 post kala-azar dermal leishmaniasis (PKADL) patients from the endemic areas of Bihar,
     India, were collected and tested for the presence of anti-Leishmania antibodies by
     enzyme-linked immunosorbant assay (ELISA) and counter-immuno electrophoresis (CIEP) techniques.
     Soluble somatic extracts (SSE) as well as the excretory-secretory products (ESP) of Leishmania
     donovani promastigotes were used as antigens in these two immuno- diagnostic methods for
     evaluation. ELISA and CIEP, using SSE-antigen, detected 67 (96%) and 64(91%) KA cases
     respectively. Ninety percent PKADL cases could also be detected by each of these two tests,
     using the same antigen. The tests were also found to be very sensitive as they were able to
     detect antibodies in the sera of 21 KA patients who were suffering from the disease for
     relatively lesser period of time and the classical aldehyde- test was negative in these cases.
     However, a false positivity was encountered in 8 out of 65 (12%) sera of patients suffering
     from unrelated diseases and 1 out of 93 (1.1%) normal controls. ELISA and CIEP, performed with
     the ESP-antigen, were found to be equally sensitive for the said KA (97% positive) and PKADL
     (93% positive) sera, as with the SSE-antigen.</p>
    <p>Moreover, none of the sera from 93 normal controls and 65 patients suffering from unrelated
     diseases gave any positive reaction in both ELISA and CIEP techniques, using ESP-antigen.</p>
    <p>The false positivity in ELISA and CIEP, as was encountered with the SSE-antigen, was found to
     be overcome by the use of ESP-antigen. Thus, the ESP-antigen of L.donovani was considered to be
     not only sensitive but also more specific in compared to SSE-antigen for the immunodiagnosis of
     Indian KA and PKADL.</p>

     human anti-Toxoplasma 1gG which has been shown to correlate well with the Sabin Feldman Dye
     test in the determination of immune status.</p>
    <p>Undi Luted serum (10 ul) and assay reagent (200 ul) are added tomicrotitre wells coated with
     a Toxoplasma antigen preparation. The wel Ls are then incubated for 30 mins at 37°C, “ashed and
     an ant i human 1gG antibody Label Led with horseradish peroxidase is added. After a further 30
     minute incubation the wel ls are washed and the enzyme activity of bound conjugate is measured
     with a Luminogenic substrate and enhancer using the Amerlite!M Luminometer.</p>
    <p>This prototype assay was used in a clinical comparison with the Dye test using 1555 sera.
     Those sera with Dye test titres of &lt;1:8 were regarded as negative, those with titres in the
     range 1:8-1:16 were regarded as borderline and those with titres of &gt;1:32 as positive.</p>
    <p>of 1555 samples of human serum tested, 1538 (98.7%) showed complete agreement between the Dye
     test and the prototype Amerlite assay. Twenty samples showed minor discrepancies (eg negative
     by the Amerlite assay, borderline by the Dye test).</p>

    <p>Cross-reactions in immunodiagnosis using schistosomal soluble egg-antigen (SEA) and Fasciola
     adult worm antigen in cases with fascioliasis, heterophyasis and schisto- somiasis were studied
     by ELISA techniques. False positive reactions occurred in 10 % and 15 % of cases with
     fascioliasis and heterophyasis respectively when using schisto- somal SEA. Using Fasciola crude
     antigen, false positive reaction occurred in 25 % of cases with schistosomiasis and 35 % with
     heterophyasis. The specificity of SEA in he- terogenous cases was 87 % while that of Fasciola
     antigen was 70 %. This difference was found to be statistically significant.</p>
    <p>It can be concluded that immunodiagnosis of schistosomiasis, fascioliasis and he- terophyasis
     in Egypt might give some false positive reactions because of the commom antigenic determinants
     between Schistosoma and Fasciola antigens. The purification of these antigens could be useful
     for increasing the specificity of ELISA when used for immunodiagnosis.</p>

    <p>HYDATIDOSIS, DIAGNOSIS, ELISA, ARC 5 ANTIGEN.</p>
    <p>There are several conflicting reports on the suitability of the enzyme-linked immunosorbent
     assay (ELISA) for the diagnosis of cystic hydatid disease (CHD) due to the metacestode of
     Echinococcus granulosus. We report on a simple, easily standardized, low-cost ELISA for the
     serological identification of anti-E. granulosus antibodies using a commercially-available
     antigen that elicits an arc 5 precipitation line in immunoelectrophoresis. The IgG-ELISA was
     highly sensitive, specific and of diagnostic value compared to the total Ig-ELISA, IgM-ELISA or
     IgA-ELISA. Minimal cross-reactions were observed in patients with a presumptive clinical
     diagnosis of CHD but not in those harbouring intestinal helminths, schistosomes or filaria. Our
     assay minimizes the possibility of false positives, a problem that plagues other ELISA systems
     for diagnosis of infectious and parasitic diseases. Compared to the indirect haemagglutinations
     test and the countercurrentimmunoelectrophoresis the IgG-ELISA was superior in sensitivity,
     specificity, positive and negative predicative values. The methodology lends itself both to
     individual patient diagnosis and also for processing a large number of samples simultaneously
     as in mass surveys. Using ultrasound and a sensitive serological assay, as we describe, will
     identify pockets of asymptomatics who may benefit from chemotherapy immediately such as with
     Albendazole, rather than undergo surgery later, with all the attendant risks.</p>

    <p>NEW TRENDS IN THE SERO-DIAGNOSIS OF SCHISTOSOMIASIS IN EGYPT.</p>
    <p>Magdi M. {smail. Parasitology department, Faculty of Medicine, Zagazig University, Zagazig,
     Egypt- Schistosomiasis-Sero-diagnosis-DIG-ELIS À À comparison has been made of a newly modified
     diffusion-in-gel enzyme-linked immuno- sorbent technique (DIG-ELISA) and an established,
     standerdised ELISA, using sera as well as whole blood adsorbed on filter paper discs. With
     known human cases of S. mansoni and/or S. haematobium, both tests showed great sensitivity in
     the diagnosis of schistosomiasis; 93% - 95% positive for ELISAand 92% - 93% positive by
     DIG-ELISA on using egg antigens, while 92% positive for ELISA and 91% positive by GIG-ELISA
     when worm antigens were used. DIG-ELISA is characterised by its technical simplicity, high
     sensitivity which make it an excellent screening serological technique especially in endemic
     areas. Moreover, the use of whole blood on filter paper discs (paper disc DIG-ELISA), rather
     than serum from venipuncture should add more advantages for its application.</p>

    <p>SERODETECTION OF ANTIBODIES AGAINST ECHINOCOCCUS GRANULOSUS IN DOGS FROM TURKANA (KENYA) D.J.

     Campaign, PO Box 112, Queanbeyan, NSW 2620 Australia Echinococcus granulosus - dog -
     serodiagnosis - Kenya An ELISA capable of detecting specific antibodies in dogs experimentally
     infected with Echinococcus granulosus was tested in Turkana with sera from dogs naturally
     infected with E. granulosus. One hundred and fourty-three dogs were shot in an area where E.
     granulosus is endemic. Their intestines were examined for helminths and a serum sample was
     collected from each dog. The sera were screened using a somatic protoscolex antigen, prepared
     from protoscoleces recovered from hydatid cysts collected from goats killed in a Nairobi
     abattoir.</p>
    <p>Anti-E.granulosus antibodies were detected in 31.5% of the dogs, but it was not possible to
     reliably distinguish between infected and uninfected dogs. Specific antibodies were detected in
     17.5% of uninfected dogs and 60% of sera from infected dogs contained no detectable antibodies.
     These results contrast with a recent | Australian study where over 72% of sera from wild dogs
     naturally infected with E. granulosus contained detectable antibodies. This difference may
     reflect the scavenging life-style of the Turkana dogs, consuming refuse, dog and human excreta,
     compared with the traditional prey/preditor life-style of the Australian wild dogs.</p>
    <p>The results indicate serological screening of dogs in Turkana using ‘'unpurified" protoscolex
     antigens is not reliable for detection of FE. granulosus infection. The use of well defined
     antigens may improve the specificity and sensitivity of a serodiagnostic test for application
     in Turkana.</p>

    <p>Three extensive gland systems in the pentastomid Porocephalus crotali elaborate E-S
     components which are secreted onto the cuticle. One of these systems, the frontal gland,
     attains maximum development in rodent intermediate hosts by the infective (VII) instar. Frontal
     glands can be harvested in bulk and the principal secretory components have been purified using
     ion exchange chromatography, SDS PAGE and IEF.. One fraction, a 52kKD basic metalloproteinase
     (pl 8.7) has proteolytic activity against extracellular matrix components and appears to
     complex with a series of low molecular weight (&lt;25kD, pl&lt;4.0) hydrophobic proteins. It is
     probably presented at the parasite surface in association with parasite-derived membranes. An
     ELISA, utilizing the metalloproteinase, has been developed which detects circulating antibody
     in rodent infections with the highest titres (&lt;1/30,000) occuring 80-90 days post infections
     (dpi), corresponding with the moult from VI-VII instar. Antibody has been detected as early as
     28dpi and persists for at least 278dpi. The four pentastomids that infect man also possess well
     developed frontal glands and ELISA's for the serodiagnosis of human pentastomiasis could easily
     be developed along the above lines. This may well show that pentastomiasis is more widespread
     than has been previously recognised.</p>

     the other hand, only one splenic isolate grew promastigotes . This patient was however negative
     by IHAT but highly positive by dot-ELISA. It was concluded that VL. should be considered in

    <p>The study of the epidemiology of hydatidosis requires that a reliable immuno-diagnostgic test
     be developed.</p>
    <p>Hydatid cyst fluid (HCF) is a complex mixture of substances but there are variations in
     immunogenicity of the different HCF antigens. Whole HCF contains 13 antigens. Two of them
     (named 4 and 5) elicit the most antibody production in animals. An effort was made to study the
     frequency of occurrence of these two antigens in varying sources of HCF 50 as to identify the
     best source of HCF antigens.</p>
    <p>Fertile and sterile hydatid cysts were collected intact from the lungs and livers of cattle,
     sheep and goats. The fluid was concentrated twenty times and tested for the presence of
     antigens 4,5, and both antigens 4 and 5 by double immunodiffusion in agar gel.</p>
    <p>All the HCF from sheep and goat livers had both antigens together. Fifty four percent of the
     liver cysts from cattle had both antigens. Antigen 4 alone was found in 50% of the lung cysts.
     Antigens 4 and 5 together were present in over 80% of all fertile cysts while antigen 4 was
     found alone in 70% of cattle cysts. It was concluded that sheep and goat liver and lung
     hydatids were the best sources of HCF containing both antigens. To study antigen 4 alone,
     cattle sterile HCF was found to be the best source of the antigen.</p>

    <p>Onchocerca volvulus Microfilariae Immune-response.</p>
    <p>Intact microfilariae of O.volvulus are thought to be non-immunogenic because of their
     inability to induce immune-reactions in or near their site of location (i.e. the eve and the
     skin). Thev show no staïning in an indirect immunofluorescense test (IFAT) using roole4 patient
     serum.</p>
    <p>Not until thev degenerate do thev provoke an immune-response, a situation in which antigen
     becomes exposei to the immune svstem.</p>
    <p>Because of the observation that intra-uterine juvenile microfilarial stages do show staining
     in IFAT, we assumed that the microfilarial cuticle is in fact immunogenic and that this
     immunogenicitv is diminished bv intra-uterine masking of surface markers.</p>
    <p>We obtained intra-uterine mature microfilariae and tried to unmask antigens using several
     different agents. We found that enzymatic treatment of the outer surface layer with pepsin
     results in positive staining in IFAT which means they become immunogenic.</p>
    <p>These results suggest that intra-uterine maskinga of immunogenic cuticle components is an
     important step in the development of O.volvulus microfilariae.</p>

     adult worm proteins Sm31 (identified as cathep- sin B) and Sm32 are very immunogenic in humans
     and experimental mice infected with schistosomes. Our interest in these polypeptides is in
     their use as antigens for the serodiagnosis of schistosomiasis. Full- length cDNA sequences
     were cloned, expressed in Escherichia coli as polypeptides fused to MS2 polymerase and tested
     for their reactivities with sera from patients with schistosomiasis. Further, we have cloned
     the antigens into an RNA expression vector. The products translated in vitro in rabbit
     reticulocyte lysates were shown to be more reactive than the MS2 fusions in immunoprecipitation
     experiments. This suggests that correct folding of the recombinant antigens may be an important
     factor for diagnostic purposes. In order to test whether proper modifications through
     glycosylation, cleavage of signal peptides and correct folding will lead to a further increase
     in sensitivity, we cloned the complete coding sequences of Sm31 and Sm32 in a eukaryotic
     system, using the baculovirus expression vector system. The recombinant proteins expressed in
     insect cells are being tested for their per- formance in serological assays.</p>

    <p>Serolgical tests; diagnosis of Sleeping Sickness; immunolgical analysis of cerebrospinal
     fluids; congolese patients.</p>
    <p>In the People's Republic of the Congo, more than 600 new cases of human trypanosomiasis are
     annually reported.</p>
    <p>The causative agent, Trypanosoma brucei gambiense, can usually be detected in the circulating
     blood, lymph nodes or cerebrospinal fluid (CF) by repeated microscopical examination. However,
     because of the relatively low sensitivity of parasitological techniques and low parasitaemia
     encountered, serological tests are indipensable for large scale screening of the population at
     risk. Only a few comparative evaluations of serological tests has been carried out and their
     usefulness is still disputed. Therefore, we present here an evaluation and comparison of four
     serological assays in the diagnosis of Gambian sleeping sickness. Serological tests :Testryp
     CATT on whole blood and on serum sample, Indirect Immuno Fluorescence (IFI) on serum and
     Cellognost Indirect Haemagglutination (CIHA), Parasitological diagnosis :thick blood films,
     microhaematocrit buffy-coat microscopy technique and mini anion exchange column technic, and a
     carefull scrutiny of the clinical signs were performed on 6093 congolese individuals during a
     mass screening of sleeping sicgness in three endemic foci. The biological period of the disease
     was determinated by examination of the cell and protein alterations in CFS, on which
     immunological analysis was also applied. Analysing 223 individuals free of Trypanosomiasis,
     CIHA on serum and IFI on serum appeared more specific than CATT on blood(100% for 95,8%), when
     the thre shold dilution were used. The better sensitivity and negative predictive value,
     determined on 211 patients with parasitologically confirmed trypanosomiasis, was revealed by
     the CATT on blood (100% and 100% respectively) following by CIHA (98,8% and 99,9%). On the 6093
     individuals 14% to 87% according to focus studied were positive in CATT on blood and CIHA on
     serum with negative parasitological diagnosis. Of interest was the fact that all the
     serological suspects analysed were found positive in immune lysis test. In the Republic of
     Congo where we demonstrated the absence of Trypanosomasis of the subgenus Trypanozoon other
     than T. b. gambiense, CATT on whole blood must be preferred to IFI on dried blood for an
     initial serological screening because of its great sensitivity and negative predictive value
     and its simplicity and rapidity of execution . Moreover, CIHA on serum must be used to confirm
     the positive CATT on blood on account of its excellent positive preditive value. In conclusion,
     even if the only sure diagnosis still relies on the demonstration of trypomastigotes in the
     patient fluids, we are convinced that association of CATT and CIHA tests may be used for
     immunological screening and diagnosis of sleeping sickness in Congo.</p>

    <p>IMPROVED SERODIAGNOSIS OF INVASIVE AMOEBIASIS USING A 67 KD ENTAMOEBA HISTOLYTICA ANTIGEN
     E.Linder, S.Haglund, H.Hallander, L.Lundin, A.Tellez. Dept. of Parasitology, National
     Bacteriological Laboratory, S-10521 Stockholm, Sweden Amoebiasis, serodiagnosis, Entamoeba
     histolytica antigen The laboratory diagnosis of invasive amoebiasis is dependent on the
     demonstration of serum antibodies against Entamoeba histolytica. The parasite is a complex
     organism containing several organelles common to host cells. These autoantibodies against eg.
     nuclear material and contractile elements give positive reactions when crude antigen is used in
     the assay. To improved the specificity of the assay we fractionated Entamoeba histolytica NIH
     strain using fluid phase liquid chromatography. The obtained fractions were tested using ELISA
     for antibodies present in sera containing autoantibodies against nuclear antigens, actin,
     intermedite filaments, tubulin, and mitocondria. The reactivity of these sera was compared to
     reactions of sera from patients with invasive amoebiasis.</p>
    <p>Several fractions of the ÆE. histolytica homogenate (FPLC fractions) reacted with
     autoantibody positive sera and amoebiasis patients. One fraction only reacted with sera from
     amoebiasis patients. In polyacryl amide gel electrophoresis and electro transfer the reactive
     component was identified as a 67 kD band. ELISA-reactive antigen fraction also precipitated in
     Ouchterlony plates with patient sera but not with autoantibody sera. The demonstration of
     higher OD values using the fraction as compared to crude homogenate or semipurified Æ.
     histolytica material suggests that assays based on the use of 67 kD component will improve both
     the sensitivity and specificity of anti E. histolytica serodiagnosis.</p>

    <p>The antigen coated with latex microparticles was supplemented with protein membrane extract.
     The fluorescence generated by the reaction with umbelliferyil phosphate is proportional to the
     amount of antibodies. This assay is rapid, fully automated, processes and quantifies 24 samples
     in 42 minutes. The value of IMx-toxo performance was compared with our routine tests : IgG
     Elisa, Isaga, indirect immunofluorescence for IgG (F G) and IgM antibodies. Results from a
     retrospective study (follow-up from 1.01.87 to 30.05.89, 105 immunocompetent patients with 395
     selected serum samples) showed 100 % of agreement in diagnosing the main stages of
     toxoplasmosis : seroconversion, acute and evolutive infection, previous immunization with
     sufficient or weak titers. In a prospective study, since June 1989, IMx M was compared with
     Isaga on 2146 serum samples. There were no significant difference between the 2 tests (p &gt;
     .05). IgM residual antibodies were investigated with IMx M and Isaga among 120 patients from
     the general population (p = 1,32) and 125 pregnant women (p = 0,33). Significant difference (p
     &lt;.005) was seen in 1087 volunteer blood donors : 27 were positive with Isaga (index 9 — 12),
     6 with IMx M (index 0,6 — 1), 3 with both. IMx G compared with IF G (1867 serum samples) gave a
     p value of &lt;.001 ; a relative sensitivity of 93 %; a relative specificity of 99,8 % and an
     overall agreement of 95 %.</p>
    <p>In conclusion : IMx Toxo is a convenient alternative method for toxoplasmosis. It also shows
     the advantage of high reproducibility and rapidity.</p>

    <p>Toxoplasmosis; Dog; Seroprevalence In this work we studied the seroprevalence of the
     Toxoplasmosis in dogs of the province of Cérdoba (South of Spain).</p>
    <p>The survey was performed on 525 dogs coming from different geographical areas and different
     in age, sex, breed and aptitude. Blood samples were taken (between 5 and 10 ml) from the
     cephalic vein and the serum was collected and frozen at -20°C until it was analyzed. In all the
     positive cases we studied the alterations of the proteic fractions of the serum.</p>
    <p>AS diagnostic technique we employed the Indirect Immunofluorescence Test (Ambroise-Thomas et
     al., 1966). The antigen was liophilized zoites of Toxoplasma gondi and the conjugate dog
     anti-lgG labelled with fluoresceine . Evans blue at 1/10000 dilution was used as counterstain.
     The working dilution for the sera were 1/40, 1/160 and 1/640.</p>
    <p>The total prevalence was 44.38%: 36.95% at titer of 1/40; 3.62% at 1/160 and 3.8% at
     1/640.</p>
    <p>We related these results to the analyse of the alterations observed in the total proteins,
     the ratio albumins/globulins and the different proteic fractions of the serum. Equally we
     related these results to the age, breed, sex, aptitude and geographic procedence of the
     dogs.</p>
    <p>Finally, we conclude that there is an intermediate to high prevalence of anti-Toxoplasma
     antibodies in the canine host throughout the whole province of Cérdoba, in agreement with
     previous anti-Toxoplasma surveys realized in cattle, sheep, goats and pigs.</p>

     method, which is easy to perform, no special laboratory equipment is needed.</p>
    <p>Problems arise, when too much nonspecific reactions occur, e.g. due to heterophilic
     antibodies. We made efforts to improve the specificity of IHA and to simplify the test
     procedure. Therefore IHAs for detection of antibodies against echinococcus granulosus/
     multilocularis, entamoeba histolytica and leishmania donovani were established by using human O
     erythrocytes. Investigations of the improved IHAs were done by testing the following samples: -
     at least 300 samples of healthy blood donors (serum and plasma) — 30 samples containing
     potential interfering factors (e.g. rheumatoid factor, etc.) - 20 samples of patients with
     other parasitic infections to look for cross-reactions - approximately 50 samples of patients
     with echinococcosis, amoebiasis and leishmaniasis to compare the sensitivity of each IHA with
     other commercially available or .in-house test systems (ELISA, IHA, indirect immunofluorescence
     assay) These studies reveal the following results: - using human O0 erythrocytes nonspecific
     reactions are reduced - time consuming control reactions and absorption procedures are no
     longer neccessary - no loss of sensitivity while specificity is improved - hemagglutination
     patterns are easier to read and to interpret by introducing V-shaped microtitration plates for
     the test procedure — both qualitative and quantitative determinations can be carried out —

     À seroepidemiological study of onchocerciasis was carried out with indirect haemagglutination
     antibody (IHA) test in all onchocerciasis foci of Tanzania. People in Bwakira, Kilosa, Amani
     and Ruvum foci had higher IHA rates of 89.0%, 74,1%, 70.1% and 55.2% respectively. Whereas
     relatively lower IHA rates of 27.4%, 20.7% and 8.59% were recorded in Mahenge, Tukuyu and Nguru
     foci respectively. It was interesting to note however, that the microfilaria rate in the IHA
     test subjects of Mahenge was 70,1% with the low IHA rate of 27.4%. Whereas in Kilosa focus, low
     microfilaria rate of 40,7% was observed with the high IHA rate of 74,1%.</p>
    <p>Sigmificance of these observations in relation to severity of onchocerciasis in the foci are

    <p>AMntigenic community 1s one of the interesting aspects in the host-parasite relationship.</p>
    <p>It is well known that S. mansoni shares antigens with the definitive and intermediate hosts.
     Based on this fact and the need of improving the available antigens for immunodiag nostic
     tests, we investigated the possibility ot using B. glabrata extracts since, it would be cheap
     and easy to prepare in large amounts. In ion it was explored their ca pacity of discriminate
     areas of transmission, based on the presence of anti-snail antibo- dies in the sera of S.
     mansoni infected persons (S T), from areas without transmission, with sera from persons no
     reinfected for at least 5 years (S no T).</p>
    <p>Sera were evaluated by enzyme immunoassay (ELISA) using anti-IgG, M and anti-polivalent Ig
     alkaline phosphatase conjugated antibodies. S. mansoni (n=65), other parasites (n=25) and non
     (n=50) infected sera were assayed. Three snails antigens: whole snail soluble extract (W),
     hemolymph (H) and hepatopancreas (HP). Due to the very low sensitivity with hemolymph, we
     continued working only with W and HP snail antigens.</p>
    <p>Unexpectedly, 60% of S T-patients showed reactivity to snail antigens in contrast with 100%
     of the S noT patients. This observation may be explained by 1immunoregulatory mecha- nisms in
     the more recently infected patients (S T). The specificity of B. glabrata anti- gens was higher
     than 83% when using any of the conjugated antibodies, however when other helminthic human sera
     were analized, it was found a strong cross reactivity, specially with the association
     Ascaris-Necator-Trichuris. These high cross reactivity makes these crude antigens useless for
     epidemiologic diagnosis since association schistosomiasis- intestinal helminthiasis is very
     frequent. Nevertheless it remains to be determined by Western blott technique, what are the
     specific antigens of B. glabrata recognized by se- ra of persons with S. mansoni and not by
     other helminth infections.</p>

     assay Diagnosis of acquired Toxoplasma gondii infections is usually based on serological
     demonstration of antibodies. Variations in the immunoglobulin binding and cell contamination,
     as T. gondii is an obligate intracellular parasite, may adversly affect these assays. The
     production of a recombinant fusion protein in bacterial hosts overcomes such problems allowing
     a standardized and reproducible assay to be performed.</p>
    <p>A cDNA library from T. gondii tachyzoites was made. Recombinant fusion proteins were produced
     from pGEX-IN plasmid expressed in Escherichia coli as glutathione s- transferase (GS1) fusion
     proteins.</p>
    <p>An enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was established using the fusion proteins H4 and
     H1l. These were compared with the soluble portions of a T. gondii sonicate and GST. The assay
     was able to detect antibodies in mice after oral infection with T. gondii cysts and oocysts.
     Indeed, there was evidence of more antibody binding to the recombinant proteins than to the T.
     gondii sonicate. A clear and significant difference between the recombinant proteins and GST
     was seen.</p>
    <p>These two recombinant fusion proteins clearly differentiated anti-T. gondii antibodies and
     are potential candidates for the diagnosis of human toxoplasmosis.</p>

    <p>Toxoplasma gondii tachyzoites treated by formalin were used to reveal the anti-Toxoplasma

    <p>Specific IgE were detected in sera from 86% of acute acquired toxoplasmosis. Their appearance
     was early during infection, at the time IgM antibodies were present and slightly preceding
     specific IgA. In serially tested patients with acute toxoplasmosis, IgE antibodies never
     persisted longer than four months. No natural anti-Toxoplasma IgE was detected. Specific IgE
     were also detected in reactivation after heart transplants or toxoplasmic encephalitis in
     patients with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome, In sera from children with congenital
     infection, toxoplasmic IgE antibodies were found at birth, during the first year of life and
     during immunologic recrudescence following discontinuation of pyrimethamine-sulfonamide
     therapy. In sera from new-born without toxoplasmosis, anti-Toxoplasma IgE were never present ;
     maternal IgE antibodies did not cross the placenta.</p>
    <p>The IgE immunocapture test is easy to perform. It could be useful to determine wether or not

    <p>The serological tests for detection of Z° cruzr infections usually employ antigens (Ags)
     present in total extracts of the parasite. Most of these Ags are common with those of other
     related parasites (7 rangeli and Zeishmanïis sp) that are co-endemic in various Latin-american
     countries; this results in some serological cross reactivity which impairs the specificity of
     present available studies. With the aim of developing a test which avoids this problem, first
     we identified, by Western blots (WB) and using human chagasic sera (HCS), an Ag of Z cruci of
     24/25 kD (‘Tc-24/25') which is not found in 7 rengeli L. braziliensis and Z. mericansa and does
     not react with sera of patients with leishmaniasis, malaria and toxoplasmosis [Piras et al.
     (1988) Acta Cient. Venez. 39 (Supl.1), 35]. In order to facilitate the purification of this Z
     cruzi-specific Ag, we have produced now a monoclonal antibody (m-Ab) directed against Tc-24/25,
     by fusing NS-1 myeloma cells with spleen cells of mice immunized with Tc-24/25 prepurified by
     WB. This m-Ab (B2E9), which is an IgGi, recognizes (in epimastigote, trypomastigote and
     amastigote forms of Z cruzf and in various isolates of this parasite) only Tc-24/25. For the
     isolation of Tc-24/25, the ascitic fluid of Balb/c mice bearing B2E9 was purified by
     DEAE-Cibacron Blue and then coupled to activated Sepharose. Partialiy purified extracts of Z
     cruzr epimastigotes were chromatographed through immunocolumns with the coupled m-Ab, thus
     achieving preparations of Tc-24/25 of high purity, which react against HCS by ELISA, WB and
     dot-blot. While dot-blot assays with total extracts of Z cru and Z rangeli show reactivity
     against HCS, as well as mouse immune sera anti-Z cruz and anti- ZT rangeli the purified
     Tc-24/25 Ag reacts only with HCS and anti-7 cruzi mouse immune sera, indicating that the cross
     reactivity between anti-Z rangeli sera and the other Z crur Ags has been removed. The
     application of this purified 7 cruzr-specific antigen to a diagnostic test which eliminates
     ‘false positives due to infections with 7 rangeli and/or Zeishmania Sp, but reacts with sera of
     chagasic patients, is now being developed. (Research supported in part by CAVEFACE, CONICIT,

     prepared from continuous culture of Plasmodium falciparum for serologi- cal diagnosis by the
     indirect fluorescent antibody test IFAT). Cultures with parasitaëmia exceeding 7%, consisted
     mostly of schizonts, were washed 3 times in normal saline, supernatant discarded and the pellet
     resuspended in 1% Ficoll v/v. This material was dispended in 1 ml ali- quots in glass
     lyophilization ampoules. Sgmples were processed on a freezedrying apparatus for 48 hours at 25
     C,Ampoules containing antigen were stored at +4 C for one year and in +35 C for at least one
     month without any loss of activity.Working solution of antigen was prepared by adding 3.5ml of
     distilled water to each ampoule, to give approximate- l1y 15-20 schizonts per oil-immersion
     microscope field.Ten «1 aliquots of antigen were placed on microscope slides, dried at room
     temperature and used for IFAT.115 serum samples were examined using both cryopreser- ved and
     lyophilized antigen of P,falciparum.The results showed signifi- cant correlation between both
     antigens.The main advantage of lyophitized antigen is the possibility of a long-term storage at
     +4 C and even in room temperature, or in tropical conditions.The use of lyophilized anti- gen
     will help to standardize serological studies and simplify distribu- tion of antigen under field
     conditions.This could be perticularly impor- tant in epidemiological surveys evaluating the

    <p>Blood sera of 675 suspected echinococcosis patients were examined with the help of Reaction
     of Scolecs Precipitation (RSP) according to Shultz, Ismagilova. RSP was positive in 568 cases,
     46 patients were not operated for different reasons. In 515 out of 522 operated cases
     echinococcosis was confirmed sirgically, 7 cases appeared to be tumors. Accuracy of in- dices
     in RSP was 98,7%. Localization of cysts in 515 cases was following liver-243(47,2%);

     cases of bone-joint tuberculosis, 14 oncological cases, 16 tuberculosis of lungs, 9 concus-
     sion of brain, 36 urological patients and 45 sportsmen aged 19-22. RSP was positive in 1(1,3%)
     case of bone-joint tuberculosis and negative in all other cases. RSP was used for examination
     of 528 blood sera of Kare- kul sheep above 6 years of age. In 265(50,2%) RSP was positive and

     time the possibility of increase of specifity and sensitivi- ty was determined. The evaluation
     of this immunotest we carried out in following parameters: duration of incubation period of
     antigens, the use of different buffer systems, purified and crude antigens, homologous and
     heterologic conjugates. The use of soluble methabolic antigens was es- tablished as one of
     conditions of high specifity. Optimal concentrations of antigen's proteins for sensibilization
     of microplates limits in ELISA were 0,5-10,0 mkg/ml. The application of heterologic conjugates
     determi- ned the decrease of sensitivity and specifity of ELISA. Purified anti- gens
     fractionated with the help of chromathography and gel-filtration methods allowed to increase
     the specifity on 15-20% and to conserve the level of sensitivity. Thus, optimal parameters were

     diagnosis Pre-operative diagnosis of cystic hydatid disease due to the metacestode Echinococcus
     granulosus depends on detecting antibodies specific to hydatid cyst fluid antigen by the
     established indirect haemagglutination method (IHA). Cross- reactivity with other parasite
     antigens is one of the draw backs of this test. We have utilized a commercially available
     purified arc-5 antigen and analysed the classes and the IgG subclasses levels of antibodies by
     the ELISA. The test subjects consisted of one group of 50 patients with confirmed cystic
     hydatid disease (CHD), a second group of 50 patients with cystic mass/lesions of non- hvdatid
     origin, a third group of 20 patients with cysticercosis and a fourth group of 90 healthy
     controls. High levels of antibodies in all 3 classes (IgG, IgM and IgA) were observed äin the
     hydatid patients as compared to the other groups.</p>
    <p>However, only I1gG antibody levels were discriminative and of diagnostic value.</p>
    <p>Analysis of the specific anti-arc 5 1gG subclasses demonstrated elevation of all 4 subclasses
     among the hydatid patients with IgG 3 being most discriminatory. The test is suitable for field
     studies as the system is automated and can handle a large number of samples simultaneously. It
     could be used as the method of choice in identifying cystic hydatid disease from patients with
     cystic mass lesion caused by other causative agents.</p>

    <p>Prelininary diagnosis of invasive amoebiasis due to infection with Entamoeba histoiytica ïis
     done in the State of Kuwait by imaging techniques such as x-ray, ultra-sound (US) and liver
     scan (LS). However such modalities can only detect a mass occupying lesion with no indication
     as to its nature. Serological diagnosis can confirm the presence of the disease by detecting
     antibodies specific for pure E.histolytica antigen. In Kuwait the indirect hemagglutination
     test (IHA) is routinely used for diagnosing the disease and titers above 128 are considered
     significant, whereas those of 64 and 128 are equivocal requiring confirmation with another
     test. In this study 282 sera were tested by the CIE? äin gels and 72 including those with IHA
     titers of 64 and 128 showed clear precipitation bands confirming the presence of antibodies to
     the antigen. Patients with lower titers were found to have unrelated infections. Sera were
     reacted with commerically purchased E.histolytica antigen on cellulose acetate membrane in an
     electric field of 52 volts for 35 minutes. Precipitetion bands were stained with ponceau red
     followed by destaining and washing. Negative reactions were obtained with sera from other
     parasitic infections including schistosomiasis (35), filariasis (20) and hydatid cyst (20).
     Twenty five sera from patients with auto-antibodies and 20 sera from normal individuals were
     tested as well and were negative. Therefore, the CIE? test could be used as a reliable
     confirmatory test for the diagnosis of invasive amoebiasis.</p>

     11001 Beograd, Yugoslavija Recent toxoplasmosis - Serological diagnosis - Obstetric patients
     Introduction of the immunosorbent agglutination assay (ISAgA) seemed to have solved the problem
     of the diagnosis of infection with Toxoplasma gondii in pregnancy, until later research showed
     that the ISAgA is ca- pable of detecting such low amounts of specific IgM antibodies that it
     can remain positive for a year(s). This suggests that the presence of IgM alone is not always
     an indication of recent infection. On the other hand, transplacental infection of the fetus
     occurs only in case of ma- ternal primoinfection in pregnancy; therefore the importance of the
     dis- tinction between primary and chronic infections and of the assessment of the exact time of
     primary infection in respect of the moment of con- ception and of pregnancy in general.</p>
    <p>The study group consisted of obstetric patients, either pregnant women or women who have just
     given birth or had spontaneous abortions. All were serologically tested by the Sabin-Feldman
     test (SFT) and the ISAgA; if both tests were positive and there was no increase in the specific
     1gG antibody titre in successive blood samples, the IgM-indirect fluo- rescent antibody test
     (IgM-IFAT) and the IgM-indirect haemagglutination test (IgM-IHAT) were performed as well. In
     most cases, this approach let us assess with reasonable certainty the time of infection in
     respect of the time of conception, thus avoiding unnecessary treatment or unjusti- fied
     termination of pregnancy.</p>

     COQUETTE - France IgA, T. GONDII, PREVALENCE Recently, detection of specific IgA against
     T.gondii P30 has been used for the diagnosis of acute and congenital toxoplasmosis (THE LANCET
     1988,1104-1107). In this way, we have developed a New E.I.A. test (PLATELIA TOXO IgA,
     DIAGNOSTICS PASTEUR/KALLESTAD) on microplate for the detection of IgA antibodies directed
     against toxoplasma gondii P30. Anti Toxoplasma gondii monoclonal antibodies labelled with
     peroxidase, used in this test are specific for a major protein (P30) at the surface of the
     tachyzoïte. This protein of molecular weight 30,000 is one of the favoured targets of the acute
     humoral immune response. The principle of this test is a double sandwich E.I.A. with capture of
     IgA on solid phase. First, we have studied the prevalence of anti T.gondii P30 IgA and IgM in a
     blood donor population from PARIS. The presence of specific IgA and IgM was determined with
     double sandwich E.I.A. tests (PLATELIA TOXO IgM and PLATELIA TOXO IgA, DIAGNOSTICS
     PASTEUR/KALLESTAD).</p>
    <p>Specific IgA were detected in 6 of 312 serums samples (1.9 %).</p>
    <p>Specific IgM were detected in 10 of 312 serumssamples (3.2 %).</p>
    <p>Among 6 positive IgA serum samples, 3 were positive in the specific 1gM E.I.A. test, one was

     gondii - natural antibodies - serodiagnosis The presence of Toxoplasma gondii infection is most
     often diagnosed by the finding of specific antibodies. Low antibody titers may develop in sera
     of individuals lacking other evidence for infection. False-positive results have been recorded
     for a number of serological tests. The occurrence of natural human antibodies to antigens of
     T.</p>
    <p>gondii has been established. The origin of these antibodies is not known. Most of them belong
     to IgM, but they are also from the IgG class. In serodiagnosis, ELISA’s for specific IgG and
     IgM were routinely used. The individual antibody response to parasitic antigens was defined
     with immunoblotting. À number of blood bank sera, sera of patients and sera obtained from women
     during pregnancy showed low IgM titers while no other evidence of T. gondii infection could be
     established.</p>
    <p>Preincubation of sera with phosphorylcholine chloride (PCC) and also with related nitrogenous
     compounds abolished the positive IgM reaction in approximately 50% of the cases. Positive
     control sera from established cases of toxoplasmosis and negative controls were not affected.
     IgM blots showed the disappearance of bands. IgG response was only slightly influenced by the
     use of PCC. Characterization of the cross-reacting determinant(s) is presently carried out.</p>

     is most often based on the serological demonstration of specific antibodies to
     Toxoplasma-gondii /T--gondii/ However, during the longstanding high titers of antibody, the
     determination of the stage of infection is difficult. The technique of SDS-polyacrylamidgel
     electrophoresis /Laemmli, 1970/ and immuno- blotting /Towbin et al., 1979/ was applied to study
     the evolution of thelgG response to T.-gendii antigens in the sequential sera of acutel
     infected patients to look for the differences in IgG response during the early and late stages
     of infection. T.-gendii trophozoites /RH strain cultivated on Hep-2 cell cultures/ was used as
     antigen /kindly supplied by C. Verhofstede, Belgium/. Both the intensity and the number of
     bands changed during the time course of the infection.</p>

    <p>Toxoplasma gondii - SIDA - Sérodiagnostic La sérologie de la toxoplasmose a été étudiée chez
     63 sidéens présentant une toxoplasmose évolutive(cérébrale n=42,pulmonaire n=1l,oculaire n=10)
     confirmée par biopsie ou imagerie associée à l'épreuve thérapeutique; parallèlement, les
     anticorps ont été titrés chez 1499 sujets VIH + afin d'évaluer la prévalence de la toxoplasmose
     et les caractéristiques séro - logiques de ces patients. La sérologie est positive chez 62/63
     malades et négative dans 1 cas de toxoplasmose pulmonaire. Les titres obtenus en dye-test (DT),
     immunofluorescence indirecte et agglutination sensibilisée ne sont pas significativement
     différents, Dans 21 cas,le DT est &gt; 400 UI; l'agglutination AC et l'IgM-ISAgA sont positives
     respectivement chez 21 et 3 sujets. 13 patients(387) sur 34 étudiés de façon itérative ont
     présenté une ascension des IgG, sans IgM. 80% des 1499 patients VIH + ont une sérologie
     positive; ce pourcentage est comparable à celui observé dans une population témoin de même âge,
     mais les titres &gt; 500 UI obtenus dans 18,7% des cas sont significativement plus fréquents
     que dans le groupe témoin (9,2%; p &lt; 0,001). Parmi 177 patients suivis pendant 1L an,
     36(207) ont présenté une réactivation sérologique sans signe clinique associé. Ces observations
     soulignent l'importance de la surveillance sérologique des sujets VIH + afin de préciser les
     relations existant entre les réactivations sérologiques, fréquentes chez ces patients, et le
     risque particulier de toxoplasmose grave observée au cours du SIDA, en raison de l'altération
     importante et irréversible de leur immunité cellulaire.</p>

     antibodies, sheep At the susceptibility studies of non-specific hosts 3 merino sheep were
     infected with 3,000; °,000 or 7,000 T. spiralis larvae. Clinical picture and dynamics of
     antibody response using LFT and ELISA methods were follo- wed. On the 152nd day of experiment
     using artificial digestion method number of 1. spiralis larvae in 9 different muscles was
     stated. The num- ber of larvae in 1 g of muscle was following: at dosis 3,000 T. spiralis -
     1,485.7 larvae; at 5,000 - 1,665.1 larvae and at 7,000 - 1,816.5 lar- vae, resceptively.
     Significant differences at infection rate of sampled muscles were observed. In ICR mice
     infected with sheep Trichinella larvae reached muscle phase. Infection of sheep had no
     influence on clinical status. Antibodies in sheep infected with 7.000 T. spiralis larvae were
     observed 8 days earlier and maximum titres 14 days earlier than in sheep infected with 3,000
     larvae. There was a correlation between antibody ti- tres and number of applied and found
     muscle larvae of T. spiralis. Our results confirm the high susceptibility of merino sheep to T.
     spiralis infection.</p>

    <p>Toxocariasis, Immunodiagnosis, IEP, ELISA Recently, toxocariasis has been reported in
     individuals following the ingestion of larvae in paratenic hosts such as raw chickin or cow
     liver in Japan. It seems likely, therfore, that Toxocara infections are more prevalent than
     commonly suspected. The morphological diagnosis of toxocariasis, however, is very difficult by
     the reason of visceral larva migrans. For the diagnosis of toxocaral migrans, IEP
     (immunoelectro- phoresis) and ELISA (enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay) were tested with
     suspected clinical cases and experimental infected rats sera. In IEP, adults, larvae and ES
     (excretory secretion) antigens were tried, and adults, larvae and eggs antigens were compared
     in ELISA. Of the suspected clinical cases, precipitin bands in IEP to adults antigen was
     detected in 80 %, to larval antigen in 54 % and to ES antigen in 75 %.</p>
    <p>The strongest bands were recognized with the ES antigen, and the specific band of Toxo- cara
     canis were demonstrated in 23 % among them. In infected rats sera, precipitin bands were showed
     32 days after infection in all cases, and the specific band were demonstrated in 82 % of all.
     Of the suspected clinical cases, antibody in ELISA to adults antigen was detected in 51 %, to
     larval antigen in 47 % and to eggs antigen in 43 %, and the highest titers were obtained with
     the larval extract antigen. In the infected rats, antibodies were detected one week
     post-infection. Peak antibody titers occured at 9 to 18 weeks and persisted for one year
     post-infection, which titers began to decrease. From the above mentioned results, the
     serological tests for toxocariasis seems to be useful for the diagnosis as already known,
     however, it should be conducted simultaneously with several techniques.</p>

    <p>A sero-epidemiological study was carried out in different areas of Africa endemic for
     Onchocerca volvulus infections using a Terasaki-plate ELISA, which was specific (100%) with
     regard to other filarial and intestinal helminth infections. The sensitivity of the test varied
     considerably in the different areas. The highest sensitivity (98%) was found in a group of
     patients (n=51) with generalized onchocerciasis from Sierra Leone, while the lowest sensitivity
     (17,9%) was found in a group of patients from Zaire, who showed no symptoms of onchocerciasis
     but whose skin contained microfilariae. The low sensitivity in Zaire was due to a low 1gG
     response (titre 1:100-1:6400) compared with the IgG response of patients in Sierra Leone (titre
     1:6400-1:102400). Sofar it is not clear if these variations are the result of (genetic)
     variations of the parasite or of the host.</p>

    <p>Fascioliasis - Human - 1gG - IgM - Immunodiagnosis Partially purified Fasciola gigantica worm
     antigen (peaks 11 and 111 by Sephadex G- 200) was used in an ELISA to measure levels of 1gG and
     IgM class-specific antibodies against Fasciola and in counterimmunoelectrophoresis (CIEP) to
     assist in the diagnosis of infection with this parasite. Sera obtained from 46 patients with
     parasitic infections and from 10 individuals free of parasites were evaluated by both
     assays.</p>
    <p>Acute fascioliasis (abdominal pain, diarrhea, moderate to high fever, enlarged tender liver,
     eosinophilia of 12-85% and eggs appearing in stools after hospitalization) was present in 20
     patients. Chronic fascioliasis (mild or no clinical symptoms, eosinophilia of k-38% and
     Fasciola eggs in the stool) was present in 11 patients.</p>
    <p>Schistosoma mansoni (eggs in stool) was present in 10 patients and amoebic liver abscess
     (positive sonogram and serology) was present in 5. ELISA was positive in all 31 patients with
     fascioliasis, two patients with schistosomiasis and one patient with amoebiasis and negative in
     all others. CIEP was positive in all 20 patients with acute fascioliasis but was positive in
     only 5 of the 11 (45%) with chronic infection.</p>
    <p>CIEP was negative in the 25 individuals without fascioliasis. Fasciola-specific 1gM levels
     were higher than 1gG levels (ELISA 0.D. readings) in patients with acute fascioliasis while
     parasite-specific lIgG levels were higher than IgM levels in those with chronic infection.
     Host-parasite interactions related to duration of infection are responsible for changing
     parasite specific IgM and IgG levels.</p>

    <p>To know the frecuency of human, horses and wild rabbits fascioliasis we choose the VII po
     litical region of Chile, a hiperendemic zone of cattle and sheep fascioliasis (90%). From 3.118
     rural, apparently healthy inhabitants from the provinces of Curico and Talca, F.he- patica
     infection was confirmed in 16 (0.51%) by presence of eggs in stool and or bile. À clinical
     study and the following immunobiological test were performed to each person: intradermal,
     complement fixation, ELISA, doble diffusion, counterelectrophoresis and im-
     munoelectrophoresis. To eachindividual who presented one or more positive testsa sequencial
     parasitological stool examination, 10 samples, by sedimentation technique and or duodenal
     intubation was performed. From 695 horses studied, 84 (12%) had F.hepatica eggs instools and
     from 674 wild rabbits capturated 41 (6%) presented parasites in the liver. It is con- cluded
     that human fascioliasis in apparently healthy people is an important publichealth problem and
     that any campaign to control this Zzoonosis must include horses and wild rabbits.</p>

    <p>Fasciola hepatica, Epidemy, IFA-VO, Triciabendazole, Iran Since early spring of 1989 several
     human cases of Toxocara sp. and F.hepatica were reported from School of Public Health of Tehran
     University. This strange parasitic epidemy made us to investigate the true cause of epidemic
     hypereosinophilia among patients coming.</p>
    <p>from southern coast of Caspian sea.</p>
    <p>Demonstration of F.hepatica ova in duodenal aspirates and stool, recovery of immature fluke
     from liver and adult worm from common bile duct of these patients confirmed that F.hepatica is
     the sole cause of recent epidemic hypereosinophilia.</p>
    <p>Therefore, various immunological methods were employed to establish a rapid reliable test for
     mass screening and follow up of treated patients. The basic and major problem was preparation
     of rather specific antigen from offending parasite. On the basis of a series of experiments
     done by others; three forms of antigen were prepared for this study: cross sections of female
     genital organ(VO) for IFA; crude antigen from sonicated adult fluke, and a soluble antigen for
     SRID, IHA and ELISA. All 4 tests were run in parallel for proved cases of Fascioliasis.</p>
    <p>Results show that IFA-VO is the method of choice for screening and follow up of distomatosis.
     In majority of patients treated with triclabendazole, a significant reduction of IFA-FO titer
     were observed about 3 months later.</p>

    <p>Afin de confirmer dans l'onchocercose humaine l'existence de l'induction d'une micro-

     effets chez 224 patients de Côte d'Ivoire, répartis en 4 groupes homogènes 1) 54 placebos, 2)
     55 à 100 ug/kg, 3) 55 à 150 ug/kg et 4) 57 à 200 ug/kg d'Ivermectine.</p>
    <p>. 5 ml de sang sont prélevés sur anticoagulants la veille du traitement et 4 jours après. La

    <p>Une microfilarémie spontanée est observée dans chacun des 4 groupes : 1) 18,5 %, 2) 20 %, 3)
     21,8 %, 4) 15,7 %. Après traitement, les 3 groupes sous Ivermectine dif- fèrent très
     significativement du groupe placebo pour la microfilaremie. Dans le groupe 1) le nombre de
     positifs (+) après traitement passe de 10 à 11 dont 8 nouveaux positifs (n+) et 7 négativés
     (-). Dans le groupe 2), le nombre de (+) après traitement passe de 11 à 33 dont 25 (n+) et 3

     over 1000 infected ewes originating from the four provinces of the Island, but primarely from
     central areas was examined to study the morphological and biological variability of the hydatid
     cysts. The larval stage of the Sardinian strain of E. granulosus may develop into 5 different
     condition: a) unilocular; b) multilocular; c) calcified; d) caseous; e) iperlaminated.</p>
    <p>Cysts classified has a) and b) were always fluid filled, but type a) were almost always
     fertile (96.3 %) and type b) almost always sterile (89.5 %) and if fertile containing very few
     protoscoleces (1-100). Non fertile cysts were always the condition of the cyst type ce), d) and
     e). The cyst size varied ranging between 1-10 cm in cysts classified a), d) and e), but varies
     ranging between 0.5-3 cm in cysts type b) and 0.5-1.5 in type c). À great variability in
     viability and size from examined protoscoleces was found.</p>

     nhase-contrast, Nomarski interference-contrast Pneumocystis carinii is an as yet taxonomically
     undefined microorganism which shows some morphological and biological properties of Protozoa
     and a significant RNA sequence homolo gy witn Fungi. Because of these reasons, it has recently
     been proposed to classify it as member of a newly defined group: Protista-Fungi.</p>
    <p>P.carinii is the well recognized etiologic agent of interstitial pneumonia in immunocom
     promised hosts, particularly those with the Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome (AIDS).</p>
    <p>In this study we present a new simple and rapid extemporaneous technique to detect P.ca-
     rinii in fresh specimens.</p>
    <p>Adequate biological specimens were obtained from 42 patients with features suggestive for
     P.carinii pneumonia by sputum induction and/or bronchoalveolar lavage and/or transbron chial
     lung biopsy. Extemporaneous phase-contrast and Nomarski interference-contrast micro scopic
     examinations were performed at the same time in all the fresh specimens and the results
     compared with a reference Toluidine Blue O0 and Giemsa stains.</p>
    <p>In unstained samples the direct microscopic identification of cystic and trophic forms of
     P.carinii was easy and more rapid than in stained specimens, and no false positive or fal se
     negative results were obtained. On the basis of our data we conclude that direct iden_
     tification of P.carinii in fresh biological specimens by phase-contrast and Nomarski in
     terference-contrast, is a safe, rapid, and sensitive diagnostic technique which would be
     considered for primary routine clinical applications.</p>

     Department of Immunology, Institute Oswaldo Cruz,FIOCRUZ, RJ, BRAZIL &amp;*Institute Pasteur de
     Paris, FRANCE Diagnosis, transfusional malaria, exoerythrocytic, P. falciparum antigens The
     prevention and control of transfusional malaria in éndemic areas depend on the development of
     testes that allow the diagnosis of assyntomatic infection. However, to evaluate the impact of
     the adoption of such tests in those areas it will also be necessa- ry to develop tests able of
     discriminating transfusional from naturally acquired malaria.</p>
    <p>The rationale . of the present work is that individuals with transfusional malaria are not
     exposed to ( and will not react with) pre-erythrocytic (hepatic and sporozoite) anti- gens of
     the Plasmodium, if cross reactions between these and blood stage antigens do not exist. Sera
     from individuals with transfusional malaria (5), nonimmune migrants to ende- mic area
     (Ariquemes/123), indians from Amazon (Xingu/117), hyperimmune individual from Africa
     (Garetanga-Burkina-Faso/54) and control individuals that have never been in en - demic areas of
     malaria (15) were tested by ELISA using the synthetic peptide 307, in order to evaluate the
     presence of autoantiodies to hepatic stages of P.falciparum.We have also studied
     anti-sporozoite antibody by IRMA employing (NANP)4 synthetic peptide, and antibodies to blood
     stage antigens by IFAT using P.falciparum parasitized blood cells.</p>
    <p>As we expected none of transfusional malaria serum presented antibodies to sporozoite or
     hepatic stages although 80% of them presented IgG antibodies to blood stage antigens.</p>
    <p>However indians from Xingu and nonimmune migrants presented low percentages of antibodies
     against hepatic (15%; 24%) and sporozoite (17%; 13%) antigens. Only hyperimmune African
     individuals presented hugh percentages of antibodies to hepatic antigens (847). The fre- quency
     of antibodÿ against these antigens increased with age, was greater in male indivi- duals from
     Xingu and decreased with time after the last past attack of malaria in indivi- duals from
     Ariquemes.</p>

     Kit Toxo, Diagnostics Pasteur) : elle a été positive dans 4 cas sur 7. La présence de T. gondii
     était associée à celle de P. carinii dans 1 cas. La sérologie de la toxoplasmose était positive
     chez les 7 malades avec des titres compris entre 20 et 1000 UI/ml, sans IgM.</p>
    <p>Globalement, la prévalence de la toxoplasmose pulmonaire est donc de 4,1 % ; elles est de 5 %
     si l'on ne considère que les sujets ayant une sérologie de toxoplasmose positive au moment de
     l'examen; ces résultats sont comparables à ceux obtenus par Marche et coll. par une étude
     autopsique systématique chez les sidéens (Conférence Internationale sur le SIDA, Montreal 1989,
     Abstract WBP 23) et confirment que la localisation pulmonaire de la toxoplasmose est la plus
     fréquente après l'atteinte cérébrale au cours du SIDA.</p>

    <p>Le seul diagnostic de certitude pour les trypanosomoses humaine et animale est la découverte
     du parasite dans l'un des liquides biologiques de l'organisme.</p>
    <p>Or la grande fluctuation observée des parasitémies rend le diagnostic très difficile,
     notamment à l'occasion d'un seul examen. D'où la nécessité de développer des techniques
     parasitologiques de détection très sensibles tout en restant faciles à mettre en oeuvre sur le
     terrain.</p>
    <p>Pour les trypanosomoses bovines, nous décrivons une technique de lyse avec
     détergent/centrifugation que nous avons développée pour le diagnostic de Trypanosoma.
     congolense, et une technique de double microcentrifugation développée par KRATZER et ONDIEK,
     dont nous avons testé la sensibilité pour T..brucei, T..congolense et T..vivax.</p>
    <p>La première technique pour T go: &gt; et la seconde technique pour les 3 espèces de
     trypanosomes nous donnent un seuil de détection inférieur à 10? parasites par ml.</p>
    <p>La technique de double microcentrifugation est beaucoup plus facile à mettre en oeuvre sur le
     terrain et nous pensons qu'elle doit devenir la référence pour le diagnostic des trypanosomoses
     animales et qu'elle peut être utilisée pour le diagnostic de la maladie du sommeil chez ,
     l'homme.</p>

     Diagnostic - Malaria - Chimiosensibility Because of the rapid extension of resistance to
     Chloroquine, the achievement of in vivo sensibility tests to Chloroquine at high level and
     repeatedly, becomes very important.</p>
    <p>At present, such surveys are based on a microscopic test of a thin smear or Giemsa coloured
     thick smears. In order to lighten the achievement of these tests while maintaining their
     reliability, we evaluated the relevance of a new malaria diagnostic method, the Q.B.C. The test
     consists in concentrating parasited corpuscles after centrifugation, in a capillary tube fitted
     with a plastic float. The tube is pre-filled with Acridin orange and potassium oxalate, the
     parasites appear green when reading through the ultraviolet ray in the microscope. À test on
     resistance to Chloroquine (25 mg/kg) was carried out at the N'djili hospital (Kinshasa,Zaire)
     according to a simplified 7 day protocol. For each sample, a thick smear and a Q.B.C. test were
     observed and read blindly. For each test, the achievement and the reading time were measured.
     The correlation between the 2 methods is good. The Q.B.C. gives only a semi- quantitative
     result, which at D3 harms the determination of the level of resistance.</p>
    <p>Nevertheless, due to its rapid achievement, its good sensitivity and easy reading, the Q.B.C.
     is an excellent tool for in vivo. Its easy handling allows health care personnel to use it
     after only a short period of training.</p>

    <p>Toxoplasmosis, in vitro diagnosis, Glioma cells The diagnosis of toxoplasmosis is usually
     serological, the interpretation is often difficult as the parasite remains latent after the
     acute infection and diagnosis is not conclusive.</p>
    <p>Inoculation of parasites in mice, may be used, but infection is slow to develop. The parasite
     has been shown to infect most types of cells. Various epithelial and mesenchymal cellines
     (Vero, LLC, HeLa and Glioma) as substrate was evaluated and a standardization of in vitro
     culture attempted using the Glioma cell line as substrate.</p>
    <p>Materials and methods: Toxoplasma gondii trophozoites, strain RH from mouse ascites were used
     to infect semiconfluent cell monolayers. In addition tenfold serial dilutions of the parasites
     (n=106-100) were added to monolayers of the Glioma cells.</p>
    <p>Growth was inhibited by fixation after 24 and 48 hours and the parasites detected by
     immunofluorescence using a hyperimmune rabbit serum.</p>
    <p>Results: Parasite replication i Vero, Glioma and LLC cells was more intense after 24 and 48
     hours than in HeLa cells. The number of parasitized host cells increased the first 24 hours,
     after that cell destruction began interferring. As few as 100 parasites could be detected in a
     Glioma cell monolayer after 24 hours.</p>
    <p>Conclusion: /n vitro culture using Glioma cells as substrate seems to be a rapid and
     sensitive method for the demonstration of live Toxoplasma gondii parasites. It's potential in
     the diagnosis of clinical infection should be evaluated.</p>

    <p>Une enquête sur l'anaplasmose bovine a été réalisée dans la région sud-ouest de l'Angola où
     est concentré plus de 90 % du cheptel bovin du pays. Le diagnostic direct est basé sur l'examen
     microscopique: des étalements sanguins concentrés suivant la technique de l'hématocrite (Gomes
     et.al., en préparation) et ELISA (J.M. Katende — ILRAD, non publié) a été utilisée pour
     détecter des anticorps. La prévalence d'Anaplasma marginale varie de 46,2 à 100 %. Il est
     présent et prépondérant dans toutes les municipalités enquêtées. Des prévalences élevées ont
     été détectées dans les zones où Boophilus decoloratus est fréquent, mais aussi là où il est
     rare.</p>
    <p>Dans ce dernier cas d'autres tiques, telles que Rhipicephalus simus, Rhipicephalus evertsi,
     Hyalomma rufipes et d'autres arthropodes hématophages rencontrés peuvent assurer la
     transmission de la maladie. Anaplasma centrale a été identifié dans la zone de Chiange - Chibia
     seulement. Sa zone de dispersion est probablement plus étendue. Les données récoltées dans la
     région d'enquête permettent de la diviser en zones endémiques (province de Huambo et la grande
     partie de celle de Huila) et en zones marginales (partie sud de la province de Huila et
     provinces de Cunene et Namibe) où la maladie fluctue sous l'influence climatique sur les
     vecteurs et des voies de transhumance.</p>

     Ecdystéroïdes, Loa-loa, Mansonella perstans, sang, Urire Les ecdystéroîdes, hormones
     spécifiques de certaiis invertébrés (essentiellement de mues chez les insectes) sont étudiés
     chez des Gabonaïs infectés par les filaires Loa-loa et/ou Mansonella perstans en fonction de
     leur présence et de leur dosage radioim- munologique chez les helminthes. La combinaison
     HPLC-RIA montre que le sérum des Gabonais témoins non parasités et d'Européens contrôles sains
     et n'ayant jamais séjourné en Afri- que contient en général de faibles taux d'ecdystéroîdes ;
     dans la plupart des cas infé- rieurs à 0.05 pmol./ml (limite de détection). Ces valeurs sont
     plus élevées dans l'urine, mais ne dépassent que rarement 5 pmol./ml (valeur estimée normale).
     Les vertébrés ne produisant pas ce type de stéroîdes, les faibles quantités observées chez
     l'homme sain proviendraient de l'alimentation (essentiellement des plantes). Les quantités
     dosées dans le sérum des Gabonais parasités sont très significativement supérieures
     (P&lt;0.001) à celles des contrôles ou témoins. De manière générale, le sérum des sujets
     parasités con- tient environ 10 fois plus d'ecdystéroïdes que celui des sujets saîns. Chez ces
     mêmes hommes parasités, les taux d'ecdystéroîdes observés dans l'urine sont encore bien plus
     élevés que ceux déterminés dans le sang ; ces valeurs peuvent atteindre jusqu'à 354 pmol/ ml.
     I1 n'existe pas de lien net entre les fortes concentrations d'ecdystéroîdes et la présence des
     parasites. Une sécrétion de quantités fluctuantes d'ecdystéroïdes par le parasite, probablement
     en relation avec son développement pourrait expliquer cette absen- ce de correlation. Quoi
     qu'il en soit, les ecdystéroïdes réalisent chez les patients un véritable test diagnostique de
     la présence des filaires Loa-loa où Mansonella perstans, puisque même les cas à microfilarémie
     très faible (1 microfilaire/ml) présentent des quantités nettement supérieures à celles des
     contrôles ou témoins.</p>

    <p>Le diagnostic prénatal de la toxoplasmose est indiqué lorsqu'une infection aigue par Tox
     -oplasma gondii survient pendant la première partie de 1a grossesse. L'isolement de T.</p>
    <p>gondii du sang foetal par inoculation à la souris prouve l'infection foetale mais le résultat
     n'est obtenu qu'en trois semaines:1la recherche de tests rapides reste donc né- cessaire. La
     numération des lymphocytes CDA+ et CD8+ du foetus a beaucoup d'intérêt pour le diagnostic de
     l'infection foetale par T.gondii: tous les cas d'infections in-utéro étudiés (7) ont des
     numérations anormales de ces lymphocytes. Le sang foetal est obtenu par ponction in-utéro du
     cordon, sous guidage échographique, et le typage lymphocytaire est réalisé sur 500 microlitres
     de sang par une technique utilisant des anticorps.cou- plés à la peroxydase. Les valeurs
     normales ont été obtenues par l'étude de 7 foetus non infectés, cellules CD4+: 1500 +
     400/microlitre, cellules CD8+: 500 + 200/ microlitre.</p>
    <p>Dans 3 cas prélevés précocément après l'infection maternelle les lymphocytes CD8+ sont
     augmentés au double de la normale, alors que dans les } autres cas, prélevés plus tardi-
     vement, ce sont les lymphocytes CDh+ qui sont abaissés (800 à 1050/microlitre). Ces ano- malies
     des sous-populations lymphocytaires varient en fonction de la durée d'évolution de l'infection
     par T.gondii et sont similaires à celles quelquefois observées chez l'adu -lte lors
     d'infections toxoplasmiques aigues; comme ces anomalies semblent être très souvent retrouvées
     lors de l'infection in-utéro par T.gondii, nous proposons que les numérations des lymphocytes
     CDH+ et CD8+soient systématiquement réalisées pour le diag- nostic prénatal de la
     toxoplamose.</p>

    <p>KEY WORDS: Experimental infestation, F.hepatica, Hydatid fluid.</p>
    <p>In our daily experience in the diagnosis of human fasciolosis, we have observed that the
     patients’ sera, in double diffusion (DD) against the hydatid antigen, initially shows an
     important degree of reactivity; this has prevented us from establishing a correct
     diagnosis.</p>
    <p>We experimentally infested 27 accidental hosts (rabbits) and 13 natural ones (lambs). New
     Zealand rabbits received an oral administration of 100 metacercariae (2 animals); 50
     metacercariae (4 animals) and 22 metacercariae (21 animals). Of the latter group, infestation
     was only confirmed biologically in 4 rabbits. Thirteen “Entrefina" breed lambs received 175
     metacercariae and infestation was confirmed biologically in all. The sera at preinfestation and
     at weeks 2-4 post-infestation of 10 rabbits and the 13 lambs (in all cases infestation was
     confirmed biologically) were studied by DD against the antigens obtained from the hydatid fluid
     (HF) (sheep liver) and adult F. hepatica flukes (sheep).</p>
    <p>Prior to infestation, all the the sera were negative against both antigens. During the 2nd
     week post-infestation, 4 rabbits (40%) showed some bands against HF but none against
     F.hepatica. Three of them had a single band, but the fourth showed three precipitation arcs. At
     week 4, the sera of the 10 animals studied showed 3 or 4 arcs against F.hepatica while against
     HF, 7 had one band and 1 had two bands.</p>
    <p>The sera of 4 lambs (30.8%) showed a greater number of precipitation arcs against HF (2-3
     bands) than against F.hepatica. This was the case of 2 animals during the second week
     post-infestation; another during week 3, and the last one during the 4th week
     post-infestation.</p>
    <p>According to the DD study, an important percentage of sera the animals (30-40%) were seen to
     show a greater number of arcs against HF than against F.hepatica. In most cases ( except in two
     lambs) this situation was reversed by week 4. A possible explanation for these paradoxical
     results would be the existence of important numbers of antigens common to both HF and the
     juvenile forms of F.hepatica.</p>
    <p>This situation should be taken into account when DD is used for routine diagnosis of
     F.hepatica, specially in Spain where cases of hydatidosis are very common.</p>

    <p>The patient was admitted to the Institute for the investigation of hepatosplenomegaly and
     ascites with considerable systemic disturbance and nonspecific clinical symptoms. The
     fine-needle aspiration liver biopsy was performed and the specimen was processed by routine
     method and embedded. in paraffin. Serial sections were stained with haematoxylin and eosin, and
     by periodic acid Schiff and Masson-trichrome methods. Numerous lemon and barrel shaped eggs
     with bipolar plugs and the wall with double shells and striations were present in all portions
     of the liver specimen. Depending on the plane of the section these ova were of variable shape
     and size, 40-65 microns in lenght and 25-40 microns in width. The appearance and size indicated
     ova of Capillaria hepatica. Histopathologic analysis revealed that the microarchitecture of the
     liver tissue in some parts of the cylinder was almost completely destroyed. The patient
     recovered after Levamisol treatment. In the two-year old child Capillaria hepatica was found as
     a unique pathogenic microorganism. The liver biopsy is the only choice procedure for the
     diagnosis of this very rare disease in humans.</p>

     d'autres nématodes, comme Baylisascaris procyonis, ont un rôle étiologique dans le syndrôme de
     larva migrans viscéral. En étudiant systématiquement 78 malades présentant une
     hyperéosinophilie supérieure à 357 et négatifs vis-à-vis des antigènes T. canis et A. suum,
     nous en avons trouvé deux présentant un arc de précipitation en Ouchterlony vis-à-vis de
     l'antigène Nippostrongylus brasiliensis adulte (=A)*. Nous avons complété cette étude en
     testant ces deux sérums vis-à-vis d'un antigène larvaire total (= L) N. brasiliensis et un
     antigène Excrétion- Sécrétion (= ES) LIII de N. brasiliensis, obtenu par culture de 48 heures

     souche de N. brasiliensis depuis longtemps, mais ne présentant pas d'hyperéosinophilie
     sanguine, a donné des résultats négatifs avec les différents antigènes N. brasiliensis. Comme
     N. brasiliensis existe mais est rare en France, et que les réactions sérologiques sont modérées
     avec un seul arc de précipité, il est incertain que ce soit ce parasite qui soit en cause chez
     ces deux malades. Par contre, il paraît très probable qu'un Nippostrongylus sp. ou un autre
     nématode voisin joue un rôle étiologique dans certains cas de larva migrans viscéral.</p>

     cytocentrifugation.</p>
    <p>Méthodes : 404 LBA de sujets suspects de pneumocystose ont été étudiés simultanément par les

     Hirokoji, Kamikyoku, Kyoto 602, JAPAN Pneumocystis carinii, cats, corticosteroid, zoonoses
     Corticosteroids were administered to produce Pneumocystis carinii infection in cats. Six of 10
     cats, injected intramuscularly for 97 to 141 days with 2 mg/cat twice weekly of betamethasone
     sodium phosphate, developed a light infection with P. carinii. Six of 7 cats, injected
     intramuscularly for 11 to 168 days with 10 to 25 mg/cat weekly of prednisolone acetate, also
     developed a light infection with P. carinii. There was no significant difference in the
     infection rate between the sexes and ages of the cats. Using the following 3 methods: Giemsa
     staining, Gomori's methenamine silver nitrate staining, and transmission electron microscopy,
     P. carinii organisms were indistinguishable morphologically from human and rat P. carinii. The
     cysts and trophozoites were usually present singly or in small groups, and they always were
     adhering to the periphery of alveoli. The inflamatory changes were inconspicuous except for the
     fact that alveolar macrophages often were seen. Corticosteroid -treated cats should be useful
     in the study of experimental P. carinii infection. This is the first reported case of
     experimentally induced P. carinii infection in cats. Lungs from 21 stray cats were examined and
     P. carinii was found in one cat. This suggests that cats may be part of the natural reservoïr
     for human infections in Japan.</p>
    <p>S8.C 33 P+O SPECIFICITY IN THE SERODIAGNOSIS OF HUMAN ANISAKIASIS
     M.Staudt,C.£.Tanner,N.Benabou,L.Bergeron. National Reference Centre for Parasitology
     (Serology), Institute of Parasitology, McGill University, Montréal, Canada H9X 1C0 Anisakis -
     Ascarids - Serology - "Cross-reactions" Anisakiasis is an important disease in human
     communities where marine fish is traditionally, or occasionally consumed raw, or insufficiently
     cooked. Effective diagnosis by serology is hampered by the possibility of false positives due
     to "cross-reactions" by antibodies to concurrent, or past infections by other ascarids.</p>
    <p>Three hundred different sera from humans living in the Ungava region of northern Québec,
     which is presumed free of toxocariasis and ascariasis, were tested by ELISA with antigens
     obtained from Anisakis simplex, Pseudoterranova decipiens and Toxocara canis. Specificity and
     sensitivity were verified with the antiserum standard of the European Economic Community. Four
     sera reacted only with the Anisakis antigen, 10 reacted only with Pseudoterranova and 50
     reacted only with the Toxocara antigen, indicating that cross-reactions do not always occur in
     the serology for ascarids.</p>
    <p>The antigens of A. simplex and P. decipiens were characterized by SDS-PAGE under reducing and
     non-reducing conditions; Western blots of the electrophoretic gels were probed with specific
     and "cross-reacting" human sera to reveal specific antigens in the extracts of the parasites.
     The results of this study indicate that ELISA serology for anisakiasis (and other ascarids) is
     essentially specific.</p>
    <p>“"Cross-reaction" in infections by ascarids is due, therefore, not to antibodies to a common
     specific antigen, but to the ability of individual humans to recognize other epitopes which are
     shared by different, phylogenetically-related parasites.</p>

    <p>Malaria detection - Quantification - Flow Cytometry À method was developed for the
     quantitative detection of malaria parasites in blood. Whole blood samples were treated with
     lysis solution, lysing all red blood cells while parasites and white blood cells remained
     intact. The samples were washed once, stained with fluorescent dyes specific for nucleic acids
     and analyzed by a flow cytometer (FACStar, Becton Dickinson). During analysis the fluorescence
     and light scatter parameters were recorded and stored by microcomputers. Asexual parasites,
     gametocytes and white blood cells were identified by their specific fluorescence and light
     scatter characteristics. The parasitemia (and/or gametocytemia) was expressed relative to the
     number of white blood cells.</p>
    <p>Low numbers of parasites can quantitatively be assessed ôäin this way, with a sensitivity

     of G. intestinalis obtained from humans and grown by both in vivo and in vitro methods.
     Replicates of these samples were prepared at different times, in vitro samples were re-grown in
     vivo and a number of clones of these samples were also produced.</p>
    <p>The data showed that in vivo and in vitro cultrue methods provided conditions that allowed
     for the growth of genetically quite distinct G. intestinalis types.</p>
    <p>Furthermore, primary samples were shown to consist of a mixture of genotypes.</p>
    <p>Independent of the culture method used, the genotypes changed as the primary samples were
     propagated for increasing lengths of time. These results have significant implications for
     other investigations of this medically important protozoan parasite, including their
     systematics, evolution, diagnosis, drug treatment, epidemiology, immunology and
     biochemistry.</p>

    <p>We propose the simplified method of helminthological investigation of soil. This method allow
     to detect all species of helminth's eggs. We used for work: laboratory centrifuge, plastic
     tubes of 40 ml capacity, glasses of 1008 capacity, small sticks for mixing of soil, plastic
     sup- ports for tubes, object carriers, sand-glass (3-minutes),.syntetic wa- shing powder,
     solution of sodium nitrate with 1,36-1,38 density (800g of sodium nitrate to 1000g of water).
     Course of analysing: we place 208 of soil, overflow by 1% solution of sodium nitrate (1:1),
     carefully mix in 100g glass. After 14-16 hours we mix the soil and pour in two tubes, overflow
     by water, carefully mix and centrifuge during 3 min. in speed of 1000 turning/min. We pour out
     the received supernatant to glass and add 25 ml of sodium nitrate solution, mix and centrifuge
     again. VWe stay the tubes for 20-25 min. After we collect the superficial layer by wire loop to
     object carrier. We microscopically observe 15 micropre- parations for one analysis. The
     efficiency of this method is 66,5+1,16%, and you can to decrease of efficiency to 78,5%+1,5%
     (our data) with the help of additional nitrate of sodium - 330 g to abovementioned solution (
     the density of solution decrease to 1,5).</p>

    <p>Since evidence is accumulating that specificity of Sarcocystis spp. to the intermediate host
     is not as strict as previously assumed, differentiating between a sarcosporidian that cycles in
     Alpine ïibex (Capra ïibex) and canids, and Sarcocystis capracanis has resulted as being
     inevitably complicated because of a common range use by ibex, goat and some scavengers of both
     (foxes and stray dogs). To reach this goal, comparative studies were carried out on the -
     following parameters of the two sarcosporidians: morphology and size of sarcocysts,
     cystozoiïites and sporocysts, ultrastructure and histochemistry of the primary cyst wall,
     pre-patent time in final hosts, infectivity and pathogenicity for kids and lambs. The analysis
     of this features is also compared to the results of investigations on the enzyme patterns of
     the parasites.</p>

    <p>Anguillicola crassus-Diagnostic-Echotomography-Distribution Regarding the fast and recent
     wide-spreading in Europe of nematods belonging to the genus Anguillicola Yamaguti, 1935,
     dwelling in the swimbladder of Anguilla anguilla Linné, 1758, we looked for an in vivo
     diagnostic of this disease. The method must be reliable, quick and easy to use, for a
     geographic distribution survey of this parasitosis.</p>
    <p>Three technics have been experienced : - coprology - radiology - echotomography.</p>
    <p>The latter is easier (examination time : 1 to 2 mn) and the most reliable : 70% of the
     parasited animals were recorded ; this rate rises 86% when the swimbladder contains more than
     two adult parasites. The data obtained by echotomography were checked by autopsy of subsamples.
     À geographic survey, in 1989, points out three main infestation centers : the Somme, the Rhône
     and the Seine rivers. Up to date the Loire river remains free of anguillicolosis through a 1365
     specimens sampling from thirteen stations.</p>
    <p>The first ecological data on this parasite in France are provided. This diagnostical method
     may be considered as a new tool for aquaculture and a prophylaxis for eel re-stocking can be
     applied.</p>

     A. Morrison, M.J.G. Farthing. Department of Gastroenterology, St Bartholomew's Hosopital, West
     Smithfield, London ECIA 7BE Giardia, antigen, monoclonal antibody, serodiagnosis We have
     generated a monoclonal antibody (Mab) to a previously uündescribed GL protein antigen of
     molecular mass 57kDa, by immunizing mice with GL trophozoites. Indirect immunofluorescence
     showed the antigen to be primarily cytosolic with some surface ex- pression. Further
     characterization of the 57kDa antigen has been done bÿ subjecting GL tropnozoites to SDS-PAGE
     followed by Western Blotting. The Mab identified a band of 57kDa on immunoblots. The protein
     nature of the 57KDa antigen was demonstrated by loss of antibody recognition after trypsin
     treatment of GL trophozoïites. Sub-cellular frac- tionation of trophozoites into
     cytosol-enriched, membrane-enriched and cytoskeletal-en riched components followed by SDS-PAGE
     and immunoblotting confirmed that the 57kDa anti- gen was predominantly present in the cytosol
     and was not a cytoskeletal protein. The 57kDa antigen was demonstrated to be present in nine GL
     isolates and all of three cloned isolates by immunoblotting. Interestingly, human sera from
     giardiasis patients but not controls also identify a 5/7kDa protein on immunoblots. A GL
     recombinant DNA expression libra:y was constructed to provide a source of genes encoding
     proteins. The Mab was used isolate the gene éncoding the 57kDa antigen. Isolation of specific
     antigens derived from Giardia might provide the basis for a clinically useful serodiagnostic
     test for giardiasis. The 57/7kDa antigen might be a potential candidate for such a test as it
     is expressed in all Giardia isolates tested and was also recognised by patients during the
     acute immune response to infection with Giardia.</p>

     STUDIES WITH CAPILLARIA PHILIPPINENSIS John H. Cross and Virginia Basaca-Sevilla, Department of
     Preventive Medicine and Biometrics, Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences,
     Bethesda, MD, USA Capillaria philippinensis, experimental infection, life cycle Capillaria
     philippinensis is a tiny nematode capable of causing serious disease and death in humans.
     Epidemics of the parasitosis have been documented from the Philippine Islands and Thailand,
     with 1-3 isolated cases reported from Japan, Iran, Egypt and Taiwan. The life cycle of the
     parasite has been described from experimental studies in freshwater fish, monkeys, Mongolian
     gerbils and fish-eating birds. Embryonated eggs swallowed by fish hatch and three-week o1d
     larvae are infective to monkeys, gerbils and fish-eating birds. Autoinfection is part of the
     life cycle in the mammalian and avian hosts, with both oviparous and larvaparous females
     present in the intestines of the definitive hosts.</p>
    <p>Infections have also been maintained in gerbils by serial passage of worms and larvae
     recovered at necropsy and introduced into clean gerbils. Passaged larvae and larvae produced by
     female worms develop into adults and reproduce. Fifty serial passages, gerbil-to-gerbil, have
     been made. Egg-producing female worms, after transfer to clean gerbils, were found to change to
     larva-producing worms resulting in hyperinfection and death of the animals. Gerbils usually
     died in 35-45 days as a result of hyperinfection; however, life could be prolonged by
     administering small doses of mebendazole or fluben- dazole. At these small dosages, eggs
     disappeared but reappeared several days later and, in most cases, the life of the animal was
     prolonged a few weeks. Incomplete treatment in humans usually resulted in relapses and, in some
     cases, death. Migrating fish-eating birds are considered natural hosts and responsible for
     dissemination of C. philippinensis.</p>
    <p>S8.D 7 p+O ON À PARASITIC CILIATE FROM MOORHEN (AVES : Gallinula chloropsis indica) N. Das,
     Serampore College, Serampore, Hooghly, W.B., India.</p>
    <p>Moorhen, trichites, adoral zone of membranelle.</p>
    <p>Parasitic ciliate was detected in fair number from freshly evacuated faecal material of
     moorhen or waterhen. The ciliate is oval in shape with a Slight dent on the left margin.</p>
    <p>This dent is connected with the trianglular cytostome with a narrow groove. The dorsal
     surface of the ciliate bears a slight hump. The cytostome is midventral in position and placed
     at the anterior end. The ciliary meridians are restricted to the ventral surface but trichîites
     are absent. À protoplasmic membrane (UM) arising from the right hand border covered almost two
     thirds of the cytostome and three adoral zone of membranelles (AZM) arise from the left margin.
     These membranelles are composed of rows of cilia arranged in a comb- like fashion. There are
     Four to six ciliary mer idians running along the whole length of the right margin of the body.
     Anteriorly, first meridian (M.) at its anterior margin supports à hood like protoplasmic ve lum
     over hanging from the groove ment ioned above and appeared to end abruptly. M, îs continuous
     with fifth meridian of the left side (M-5) M and M, with M-6 and M-7. M-4”appeares to remain in
     touch with AZM., M-3 with AZM,, M°2 and M-1 are two post oral meridians. The length of the
     ciliate varies from 64.8 to 40.4 microns and breadth between 31.2 to 60.0, the average being
     85.32 x 47.2G microns. Macronuc leus is oval in shape and average measurement îs 27.6 x 14.4
     microns.</p>
    <p>The micronuc leus is spherical and measures 2.4 to 3.00 microns in diameter. Division is by
     transverse binary fission. Stomatogenesis starts by a break in all the left marginal mer idians
     at the equatorial region. During division the upper half of the ciliate maïintain their
     original position while the lower half curves more towards the median axis. After the formation
     of cytostome the cytoplasmic division takes place and the organism twisted upon each other to
     get separated as daughter individual.</p>

    <p>The aim of this investigaction was to find. out whether the presence of anti- Entamoeba
     histolytica IgA antibodies in saliva could identify intestinal infection with E. histolytica
     among 223 school children. Four groups of children were identified through coproparasitoscopic
     examination: E. histolytica as the only parasite (33 percent); E. histolytica combined with
     other parasites (22 percent); other parasites except E. histolytca (20 percent) and a
     parasite-free group (25 percent).</p>
    <p>The diagnostic accuracy of ELISA in the search for salivary IgA antibodies to an E.
     histolytica membrane extract was 91.5 percent, with 85 percent sensistivity and a 98 percent
     specificity, as determined by plotting a Receiver Operating charasteristic (ROC) curve for the
     selection of the optimal A410 cut-off point. Also, a positive correlation (r=0.753, P 0.001)
     was observed between the concentration of E.</p>
    <p>histolytica membrane antigen in feces and the finding of salivary IgA antibodies to this
     perasite, as determined by means of ELISA.</p>
    <p>These results indicate that.the search for IgA anti-E. histolytica antibodies in saliva may
     be of value in the diagnosis of intestinal amebiasis, Moreover, collection of saliva provides a
     non-invasive sampling method for immunoepidemiological surveys on this parasitosis.</p>

     Thailand.</p>
    <p>The sensitivity and specificity of enzyme linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA) for the
     diagnosis of gnathostomiasis were determined using either adults or third-stage larvae of
     Gnathostoma spinigerum as the target antigens. The study was carried out in patients with
     proved gnathostomiasis (15 cases), patients with other parasitic infections (109 cases) and 25
     healthy volunteers. Sera from all patients with gnathostomiasis reacted with both the adult and
     larval antigens in the ELISA, while none of the 25 healthy volunteers gave a positive result.
     Although twenty-seven patients (24.77) with other parasitic infections reacted with both
     antigens, and their net optical densities (o.d) were higher than the cut off point (0.44 for
     larval antigen and 0.23 for adult antigen, using 1:400 serum dilutions), the mean net o.d
     values were significantly lower than those of sera from patients with parasitologically
     confirmed gnathostomiasis (p &lt;0.001). In the 15 patients with gnathostomiasis, the ELISA
     immunoglubulin G antibody titres using adult antigen (1:400-1:102,400) were similar to those of
     the third stage larvae (1:1600-1:409,600) (p &gt;0.05). Using the adult and larval antigen, the
     sensitivity of these tests were 1007 and specificity were 807 and 81% respectively. Adult
     stages of G. spinigerum obtained from dogs yield considerably more antigen and are easier to
     prepare than the antigens from third-stage larvae in experimentally infected mice. The results
     of this study indicate that crude extract adult antigen is a good alternative to larval antigen
     for the ELISA immunodiagnosis of human gnathostomiasis.</p>

    <p>Key words: G. lamblia, ELISA, Coprodiagnosis An enzyme linked imnunosorbent assay has been
     evaluated for coprodiagnosis of giardiasis employing anti Giardia lamblia trophozoites
     antibodies to capture the G.lamblia specific stool antigen(s) which was further detected by
     horse-raddish peroxidase conjugated anti G.lamblia stool antigen(s) specific antibodies.
     Antigen(s) was demonstrated in stool elu-tes from all the 24 confirmed cases of giardiasis.</p>
    <p>None of the stool elu-tes from apparently healthy subjects or from patients carrying
     intestinal parasites other than G. lamblia, had detectable amount of G. lamblia specific
     antigen(s). Of the 25 microscopically negative clinically suspected cases of giardiasis, 17 (68
     %) patients had G. lamblia specific antigen(s) in their stool elu-tes. These patients responded
     to antigiardial therapy. Enploying anti G.lamblia stool antigen(s) specific antibodies, the
     specific antigen was isolated and affinity purified. Affinity purified G. lamblia specific
     stool antigen had a molecular weight of 66 KDa and its imnunoreactivity was lost upon heat or
     trypsin treatment. However, the imnunoreactivity remained unaltered upon metaperiodate
     treatment. It is felt that the ELISA system is a sensitive and specific tool for coprodiagnosis
     of giardiasis especially in highly suspected cases.</p>

    <p>A SIMPLE TECHNIQUE FOR DETERMINATION OF WORM LOAD OF TAENIA INFECTION P.C. Fan! &amp; W.C.
     Chung?. 1Department of Parasitology, National Yangming Medical College, 2Department of
     Parasitology, Taipei Medical College, Taipei, Taiwan, ROC Worm load - Scolex recovery rate -
     Taenia infection Taenia infections are generally believed to consist of a single worm.
     Recently, surveys on Taenia infection among aborigines in 9 mountainous areas of Taiwan
     indicate that 33% of the patients harbored 2-24 worms. For certain infectivity and clinical
     phenomenon of the cases of taeniasis, it is important to determine the worm load.</p>
    <p>However, the number of gravid proglottides expelled daily range from 1 to 5 and the number of
     eggs in each gravid proglottide or in the stool is also very irregular. A simple technique for
     the determination of worm load in the field was, therefore, devised and applied. Nothing but
     fruit juice or warm water was allowed for the patients in the morning. À total dose of 1.0 gm
     (for females) or 1.2 gm (for males) atabrine was administered to 17 cases in 2 divided doses at
     30-minute interval with 3 gm sodium bicarbonate. Saline purgative of 25 magnesium sulfate was
     given with 300-500 ml water 1.5 hours after the second dose. Purged stool samples from each
     patient were collected consecutively in labeled transparent plastic bags (45 x 50 cm) until 2
     samples without proglottides. Stool samples were washed several times, then worms, strobilae,
     and segments were examined with naked eye immediately. The numbers of worms with or without
     scolex, strobilae, and segments in each of bags were counted and recorded separately.</p>
    <p>The first stool sample was obtainable within a few minutes after the purgative was given and
     the last sample within L1 hour. Worms, strobilae, and segments were most frequently seen in the
     second sample and complete worms were still collected even in the fourth sample. The results
     demonstrated that each patient had 1.5 worms on the average (ranged from 1-6 worms), the scolex
     recovery rate was 92%. This method is simple, rapid, accurate, practical, and cheap for use on
     Taenia infections, since it can be widely applied in field situations without microscope and
     counting equipment.</p>

     pathology - gazelles Examination of nodules from the intestine of Thomson's and Grant's
     gazelles, Gazella thomsoni and G. granti, in Kenya revealed the presence of the
     trichostrongylid nematode Cooperioides antidorca. Nodules from the two hosts are histologically
     similar and take the form of chronic inflammatory lesions extending through the wall of the gut
     from the submucosa into the muscular layers. There is some’ necrosis around the parasite
     located in the centre of the nodule, a varying population of inflammatory cells and a varying
     degree of fibrous tissue encapsulation. One nodule shows an ulcer forming an aperture from the
     nodule into the lumen and there is also evidence of serosal proliferation probably due to the
     parasitic lesion penetrating the deeper layers of the wall. The morphology of Cooperioides
     antidorca has been studied by light and scanning electron microscopy. This parasite was
     originally described by Monnig, 1931 from the small intestine of Antidorcas marsupialis in
     Southern Africa and later recorded from Thomson's and Grant's gazelles in Kenya and Tanzania.
     Borner et al, 1987 found nodules in the wall of the small intestine of Thomson's gazelle in the
     Serengeti, Tanzania and attributed these nodules to the presence of a nematode they identified
     as Paracooperia sp. The parasite they refer to is likely to be Gazellostrongylus lerouxi, at
     one time erroneously placed in the genus Paracooperia. The pathology of G. lerouxi was studied

    <p>Giardia lamblia is a flagellated intestinal protozoan parasite with world wide distribution.
     It causes a spectrum of disease ranging from asymptomatic to severe diarrhoea and weight loss.
     Microscopical diagnosis with a single concentrated faecal sample is only 50%-70% sensitive and
     alternative invasive diagnostic methdos are impractical, especially for young children. An
     antigen capture, enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) known to be specific and sensitive
     when tested on samples collected during an English outbreak of giardiasis was evaluated in a
     group of school children. Faecal samples were collected from 722 children aged between 3 months
     and 10 years attending seven nursery schools and one primary school in Santiago, Chile.
     Microscopy was performed on formal ether faecal concentrates. 162 samples from children
     providing 3 samples were also tested with the antigen capture ELISA. The overall prevalence of
     Giardia lambia was found to be 33%, with a higher prevalence (38%), among primary school
     children, but no association between socio-economic group and prevalence. The ELISA was 99%
     sensitive and 96% specific with a predictive value for a positive test of 95%. The assay is
     suitable for visual interpretation and is readily applicable to large scale epidemiological
     studies as well as to individual diagnosis.</p>

     Uppsala, Sweden Sarcocystosis, cattle, sheep Sarcocystis is recognized as a cause of clinical
     and subclinical disease in animals and of economic loss in farm animal production. There is an
     increasing need for improved immunological methods to assist in specific diagnosis and
     monoclonal antibodies would therefore be an important aid.</p>
    <p>Ovine and bovine Sarcocystis antigens were produced by digestion in pepsin-HCl of cardiac
     muscles containing Sarcocystis microcysts, and released cystozoites were purified using Percoll
     solutions. Mice were sub sequently immunized in their hindleg footpads with freeze-thawed
     cystozoite suspensions and Freund's adjuvans. Cells from local drainage lymph nodes were
     isolated nine days after primary immunization and hybridized with Sp2-0 myeloma cells. Antibody
     secreting clones were checked for reactivity against homologous and heterologous Sarcocystis
     cystozoites and Toxoplasma gondii tachyzoites, with indirect fluorescent antibody tests.
     Positive clones showed various distinct patterns of staining the organisms, and a total
     crossreactivity with the heterologous Sarcocystis species, but none with Toxoplasma was
     observed. Isotypes were determined by ELISA, the majority of clones obtained produced
     antibodies of IgG class.</p>

    <p>The seasonal variation in protozoan para- sites infectings fish of the Lake Parvatsar has
     been studied for the first time.The lake had varied fish population belonging to the genera
     Puntius sarana;lLabeo rohita;Rasbora daniconius;Ompak bimaculatus and Chenna punc- tatus.Of the
     above five genera the first P.sarana has shown heavy infect- ion whereas the other four did
     not.</p>
    <p>Regular monthly samples of fish collected revea- led intresting combinations of protozoan
     parasites.The parasites identi- fied were new to literature,therefore reported as new species
     belonging to the following genera:- Myxosoma ... M.mathurii;M.nagorae;M.boggae Myxobolus ...
     M.parvathsarae;M.sophorae;M.parvathesamii;M.asgarii Thelohanellus ... T.aadri. Cryptobia ...

     JNA 18,Yugoslavia Sarcocystosis, Sheep, Antigens, Immuno-diagnosis Three antigens of
     Sarcocystis ovifelis were isolated from macrocysts located in the oesophageal musculature of
     adult sheep. These antigens were characterized on the basis of their physico-chemical
     properties and on the results of the Hirst test. The population examined consisted of à
     naturally infected population of sheep aged two months to six years. The diagnostic methods
     employed were the indirect haemagglutination test (IHAT) and the indirect fluorescent test
     (IFAT), using the three antigens we isolated. The IHAT proved to be a more appropriate method
     for the early diagnosis of sarcocystosis of sheep spontaneously infected with Sarcocystis
     ovifelis.</p>

    <p>immunocagnosis of Éoeniusis Experimental canine taeniasis was used as a model for
     immunodiagnostic studies on human taeniasis. Saliva samples, from dogs monospecifically
     infected with Taenia pisiformis were assay by ELISA for specific IgA and IgG antibodies.
     Somatic and ES extracts were prepared from strobila and metacestode stages. Sequential saliva
     antibodies were best correlated with infection status when assayed with strobila ES.</p>
    <p>Saliva samples from taeniasis patients were also positive for specific IgA antibodies when
     assayed against homologous strobila ES. Detection of salivary IgA antibodies may be useful in
     developing a specific immunodiagnostic test for human taeniasis.</p>

    <p>Schistosomiasis - Egg excretion variability - Diagnostic We investigated the day-to-day egg
     excretion variability in urinary and intestinal schistosomiasis patients, in order to define
     its impact on the diagnostic performance of parasitological techniques.</p>
    <p>To do so, we followed up for five consecutive days 752 children of four primary schools in a
     S. haematobium endemic area in Southeastern Tanzania, with the urine filtration technique. In
     one of the villages, also endemic for S. mansoni, we followed as well 160 children with the
     Kato thick smear technique.</p>
    <p>Detailed analysis of individual egg excretion patterns showed a marked day to-day
     fluctuation, characterized by many days with low egg counts and few days with high egg counts.
     The negative binomial probability model described best the observed pattern. The number of
     positive days/child correlated with the intensity of infection. The daily prevalence rates
     remained however fairly stable for both parasites (range 23.1-26.9%, CV=6.</p>
    <p>% for S. haematobium and 51.3-61.3%, CV=7.5% for S. mansoni). With urine filtration, 67.5% of
     all infections and only 44.1% of heavy infections wer detected already on the first day. With
     the Kato thick smear, 73.5% of the S. mansoni infected children were already detected on day
     one.</p>
    <p>These facts have to be considered when designing chemotherapy control programmes and when
     these techniques are chosen as references to evaluate other diagnostic techniques.</p>

    <p>Diagnosis, field assay, urinary schistosomiasis The purpose was to develop a simple
     quantitative assay for the demonstration of urinary S.haematobium eggs to be used for
     epidemiological screening purposes to identify "high egg excretors”.</p>
    <p>Materials and methods: 200 ul of urine was pipetted into the wells of 96 well microtiter
     plates and allowed to sediment for 30 min. Sedimented eggs wère identified by microscopy. To
     improve readability, the red cells present in some urines were lysed using saponine.</p>
    <p>Results and discussion: By recording the number of eggs sedimented in four parallel samples
     from each urine a good reproducibility could be demonstrated.</p>
    <p>Preliminary results of correlation to urine filtration method, indicate that egg counts have
     to be determined very soon after micturition as eggs have tendency to aggregate. Egg counts
     determined by parallel readings should that the method is reproducible. We conclude that the
     microplate sedimentation method described is potentially valuable for screening purposes.
     Evaluation of a population in an endemic area in Guinea Bissau will be performed.</p>

    <p>COMPARATIVE MORPHOMETRY OF GIARDIA TROPHOZOITES FROM MAN AND ANIMALS

     Medicine, 61-701 Poznañ, Poland Giardia, trophozoites - morphometry Morphometrics alone as a
     classification tool for Giardia species is still disputable. However, when more Giardia
     isolates from different hosts are examined it is likely that the validity of morphological
     characters will be settled. Besides human, we recently established axenic cultures of Giardia
     from ape, monkeys,and rodents. In this study the lenght (L) and width (CW) of trophozoites (100
     cells), as well as the lenght of their ventral discs (VL), of 10 isolates belonging to G.
     duodenalis group were examined; 5 isolates were from human with or without symptoms and 5 from
     animals with asymptomatic giardiasis (siamang, slow loris, lesser slow loris, Gambian giant
     pouched rat and cuis). Fixed (Schaudin solution) and stained (hematoxylin) morphologically well
     - defined trophozoites from mid - logarithmic cultures were measured bv light microscopy at a
     total magnification of 1000 x with an ocular micrometer. The similarity between all
     measurements analysed by nearest neighbor method (clustering by single linkage) in
     three-dimensional space grouped the Giardia isolates in four clusters. The results of the
     analysis of variance for the three individual average measurements (L, W, and VL) confirmed the
     results of cluster analysis (a P&lt; 0.00001 was considered significant for statistical obser-
     vations). However, these statistically significant differences grouped the Giardia isolates
     independently from the host from which they had been isolated. The results confirmed the
     opinion that the morphometrics of Giardia trophozoites is not a reliable criterion for isolates
     speciation.</p>

    <p>Dans le cadre de l'étude des mécanismés immunitaires locaux opposés à l'implantation
     entérocytaire de Cryptosporidium chez des patients atteints du SIDA nous établissons un profil
     protéique sérique et fécal composé des protéines suivantes : al-antitrypsine (al-AT), IgA
     totales (IgAt), IgA monomères (IgAm), IgA polymères (IgAp), IgG, IgM, lactoferrine (L£f) et
     lysozyme (Lzm). Nous observons chez ces patients une diarrhée quasi- constante. Les débits
     fécaux de l'al-AT, des IgAt, m et p, des IgG, IgM, de la Lf et du Lzm sont très supérieurs à
     ceux observés au cours du SIDA sans cryptosporidiose (coefficients multiplicateurs (CM)
     respectifs : 5, 6, 5, 6, 5, 46,46 et 22) (p &lt; O0,0001). De même, les clairances intestinales
     (CL) de l'al-AT (CLAT), des IgAm (CLIgAm) et des IgG (CLIgG) sont très augmentées (CM
     respectifs : 2,1, 2,1 et 3,5). La diarrhée hydroélectrolytique de type sécrétoire correspond
     très vraisemblablement à un effet entérotoxine-like du parasite. L'élévation des CLAT et CLIgAm
     traduit une augmentation de la perméabilité de la barrière digestive. Le système immunologique
     intestinal (GALT) participe intensivement à la réponse anti-parasitaire. Pendant la phase aiguë
     de l'infection par Cryptosporidium la réponse immunitaire humorale intestinale est plus
     importante et plus précoce que la réponse systémique. Toutefois, l'efficacité du GALT semble
     inconstante face à Cryptosporidium et nous en recherchons actuellement l'explication par
     l'exploration dynamique de l'immunité humorale de l'interface muqueuse in vivo et in vitro au
     cours de l'infection par le VIH.</p>

    <p>A NEW STAIN ‘'AGINYA'S STAIN FOR THE DIAGNOSIS OF HELMINTH OVA IN HUMANS Aginya's Stain was
     developed to increase sensitivity in the diagnosis of human helminth infection with special
     emphasis on schistosome ova for which it was intended. Aginya's Stain, was evaluated by
     comparing its sensitivity with Kato's Stain and the direct unsta- ined smear. Faecal samples
     from 21 individuals aged between 4 and 15 years, pupils in Nakiwogo Primary School situtated
     near a busy canoe landing siteon the shore of Lake Victoria were used in the study. The
     children in this school have been found to have mixed infection of Schistosoma mansoni with
     several other parasites. À measured amount of 53 mg of strained faecal : material was stained
     with Aginya's Stain, Kato's Stain and covered with cellophane cover slip. The direct unstained
     smear was treated similarly.</p>
    <p>The ova of different parasite in individual specimen were numerated by two workers.</p>
    <p>Each worker prepared three slides per specimen and technique. The average of the count in the
     si: slides was taken as the final count of the parasite ova. This figure was multiplied by a
     factor of 18.87 to get the count of the parasite ova per sram of the specimen and the technique
     used. Aginya's stain gave clearest visibility of the para- site ova. As the result it was easy
     to numerate the parasite ova in it because of the distinction in morphology. Aginya's Stain
     also gave more count than either Kato's Stain or direct unstained smear (P &lt; 0.05). Finally
     Aginya's Stain distinguished between viable and dead ova. Aginya's stain can be used with
     confidence for the diagnosis of helminth ova in humans. The 53 mg of faecal material used in
     this study is suitable in areas where egg load is low. In endemic areas 20 mg of stool specimen
     should be used.</p>

     and is easily and rapidly diagnosed by endoscopy or intestinal resection. Specific serology and
     eosinophilia are normal but become positive 10-15 days later. Eight acute cases were followed

     eosinophilia and dietary habits including eating raw or improperly cooked fish or eggs of fish.
     Histopathologic sections when done, show eosinophilic granulomas.</p>
    <p>The follow up of one of these patients for three and a half years showed the transformation
     of the granuloma into an adenomatous polyp, a variety susceptible to degenerate in 15 Z of the
     cases. This observation associated to epidemiologic data particularly with the elevated
     frequency of anisakiasis and gastric carcinoma in Japan leads us to discuss the role of
     co-factor of A. simplex in some of gastric cancer cases.</p>

    <p>A study on the relation of faecal egg excretion to worm burden and clinical features was
     carried out in 45 patients with Opisthorchis viverrini infection who had no biliary
     obstruction.</p>
    <p>Praziquantel 50 mg. per kg. body weight was given to all patients. Faecal egg counts were
     done daily for 15 days before and 7 day after praziquantel administration. Expelled worms were
     retrieved from every stooïls on days 1 to 7 post treatment.</p>
    <p>The faecal egg excretion was consistant correlation with the worm burden. Mild hepatomegaly
     and thicken wall or dilatation of the gallbladder were found more commonly in heavily infected
     patients. Eosinophilia was observed more often than previous reports. Concomitant parasitic
     infections were found in 82% of the patients. High eosinophil was signiticant related to other
     parasitic infections associated to opisthorchiasis. Egg counts increased greatly during the
     first few days after praziquantel treatment, then decreased to very low level in 7 days S8.D 3

    <p>Acacia honey - Optimal density - Helminths ova - Flotation Application of acacia honey, high
     density substance - over 1.400 g/cm5, is presented as a medium for intestinal helminths ova
     flotation. As intestinal helminths ova differ in size, shape and density, it was presumed that
     one species ova would numerously swim out in certain density medium, and respectively the other
     species in different density medium. According to the laws of flotation, preceding
     investigations were performed: infuluence of sorts of honey on flotation, speed and time of
     centifugizing and liquid column hight. On the basis of these investigations it was decided to
     perform the flota- tion in acacia honey. 17 stools with Trichuris trichiura ova, 14 stools with
     fertili- zed and 10 with unfertilized Ascaris lumbricoides ova, 10 stools with Hymenolepis nana
     ova and 10 stools with Teania species ova, were examined. Homogenized suspenzion was made of
     stools and 0,5 ml of each sample was transfered into tubes with honey density from 0,050 g/cm5,
     1,075 g/cm5 ... to 1,425 g/cm5. After centrifugizing /2500 rpm, 5min./ 5 microscopic slides
     were made from each tube and number of found ova in all 5 was pre- sented as a mean value.
     Results of investigation showed that the gratest number of Tri- churis trichiura ova swims out
     in 1.275 g/cm5 density of honey, fertilized Ascaris lum- bricoides ova in 1.250 g/cm3 and
     Hymenolepis nana ova, Taenia species and unfertilized Ascaris lumbricoides ova in 1.325 g/cm5.
     These result can be applied for pointed inves- tigations and examinations of stools with small
     number of parasites ova.</p>

    <p>A study of geohelminth infection was conducted among 9-11 Year old school children in the
     town of Mandeville, Jamaica. Stools from 597 subjects were screened using the Kato Thick Smear
     Technique and an overall prevalence for Trichuris trichiura of 67.2%, Ascaris Lumbricoides of
     30.5% and Necator americanus of 6.4% was observed.</p>
    <p>loderate to heavy infections of Trichuris, Ascaris and Necator were foun&amp; in 27.3%,
     15.89% and 0.7% of children respectively. In the two schools where children were streamed
     according to their academic ability the slower streams were found to have a significantly
     higher prevalence and mean intensity of infection for all of the three para- sites. Trichuris
     prevalence in the top stream was 50.8% and only 14.6% (range 4.7 to 21.7%) of all children had
     moderate to heavy infect- ions. Incomparison, 76.3% of children in the bottom stream were
     infecte&amp; with Trichuris and 39.5% (range 20.7 to 54.93%) had moderate to heavy loads.
     Helminth infection persists at intensity and preva- lence levels likely to be of detriment to
     the health of Jamaican children. Furthermore, it is suggested that control programmes which
     selectively target treatment within schools to the slower streams may be an alternative option
     for health policy makers to consider.</p>

    <p>Phospholipid metabolism, polar heads, fatty acids, Plasmodium falciparum, erythrocyte.</p>
    <p>Presently, new therapeutic approaches to the endemic disease, malaria, are actively being
     investigated. One of these involves interfering with parasite metabolic pathways, which could
     provide a new range of antimalarial drugs with original structures and modes of action.
     Phospholipid (PL) metabolism constitutes a possible target since it is absent from normal
     mature human erythrocytes. To sustain its high PL metabolic activity, the parasite enzymatic
     machinery uses precursors i.e., polar heads and fatty acids, originating from the plasma (see
     Vial et al., in the present congress). The systematic screening of more than 70 compounds shows
     that interfering with the polar head (mainly choline or ethanolamine) or fatty acid
     incorporation into the infected erythrocyte, is lethal to the parasite in vitro. Fatty acid
     analogs acted by inhibiting acylCoA synthetase, the first enzyme involved in fatty acid
     incorporation, whereas choline analogs specifically impaired choline transport in infected
     erythrocytes, resulting in phosphatidylcholine de novo biosynthesis inhibition. Small
     ethanolamine analogs incorporated instead of the natural precursor leading to accumulation of a
     false PL at the expense of the natural one (phosphatidylethanolamine). In both cases (fatty
     acid or polar head analogs), a close correlation exists between the PL metabolism impairment
     and in vitro parasite growth inhibition. Finally, measurement of the effects of some polar head
     analogs on a lymphoblastoid cell line revealed a 5-10000 lower toxicity to- wards these cells
     and demonstrated a total absence of correlation between parasite growth inhibition and
     lymphoblastoid cell growth inhibition. Together, these results demonstrate that PL metabolism
     is a very realistic target for new malaria chemotherapy.</p>

    <p>Plasmodium falciparum - Protease inhibitor.</p>
    <p>Proteolysis is an essential mechanism for intraerhytrocytic development of the malaria
     parasites. We previously characterized in P. falciparum (P.f ) two goups of proteases acting
     within acidic pH range; one hemoglobinase with a cathepsin D like activity and a cystein
     protease. These proteases were strongly sensitive to Pepstatin À (an aspartyl protease
     inhibitor) and E64 (a cystein protease inhibitor) respectively.</p>
    <p>The antimalarial activity of Pepstatin À (37 UM) was investigated during 6, 18, or 48 hours
     in vitro P.f culture. After 48h parasite density was reduced by 94-100%, parasites were killed
     at the early stages and were pyknotic form. The antimalarial activity of E64 (28 M) was also
     investigated. After 48h of incubation the parasite development was totaly inhibited, since 18h
     incubation altered the growth (GI E64&lt;1 and GI control= 4.after 24h culture without E64,
     GI:Growth Index). After 6 hours culture in presence of E64 followed by culture without
     inhibitor 86% of parasites were schizonts, comprising 54.6% presenting 8 nuclei. 60 hours after
     the end of incubation, synchronization persisted with 78% of schizonts comprising 743% with 2-4
     nuclei. Morphological alterations observed after 6h incubation (altered parasites = 22%)
     disappeared after 18h culture without E64 (altered parasite = 3%). In expriment where
     erythrocytes were preincubated 18h with Pepstatin A (37 1M) growth of P.f was totaly
     inhibited.</p>
    <p>In the same conditions E64 (28 LM) allowed parasite development similar to control. The
     differential sensitivity of P.f to Pepstatin A, and E64 showed important and specific role of
     acidic proteases in intraerythrocytic development of parasite.</p>

     chromatography - 4- and 8-Aminoquinolines - Quinine The need for simple, fast and reliable
     methods to determine the consumption of antimalarial drugs for pre- and post-therapeutic
     monitoring as well as for epidemiological studies is widely recognized. The classical methods
     (e.g. Dill-Glazko) lack a sufficient sensitivity and specificity. The introduction of new thin
     layer materials in the form of well defined and controlled silica particles led to a revival of
     thin layer chromatography.</p>
    <p>Based on this technique we developed a testkit, which allows the determination of several
     antimalarial drugs in the urine.</p>
    <p>Small urine samples are directly applied onto HPTLC-Silica gel plates and the plates are
     developed in a solution of toluene- diethylamine- methanol (8:1:1) in an appropriate
     development chamber. Chloroquine, quinine, amodiaquine, primaquine and their metabclites can be
     detected as fluorescent spots under a long wave ultraviolet light source provided by a solar
     powered pocket lamp.</p>
    <p>The method has already been tested in several places and was shown to be reliable and
     relatively cheap. Further studies are needed to determine the excretion patterns of the
     different antimalarials in urine and the necessary detection limits for meaningful correlations
     with blood levels.</p>

    <p>In view of the knomprimary mode of action of benzimidazoles (BZ) on tubulin, which might
     exist in mitochondrial membrane it was of interest to determine the ‘in vitro! effect of
     levamisole (LZ) versus mebendazole (MZ) on a membrane bound energy generating complex
     (mitochondrial ATPase) in Trichinella spiralis and T. pseudospiralis larvae.</p>
    <p>The activity of ATP hidrolase was measured in Trichinella larvae mitochondria according to
     colorimetric micromethod of Muszbek et al. (1977), after 25 minutes of incubation at 37°C with
     water soluble LZ (Janssen Pharmaceutica) or DMSO soluble MZ (polymorphic form C, concentration
     of DMSO in cuvette 0.8%). In intact mitochondria the latent ATP-ase activity of both nematodes
     was 15-20 nmoles of P /min/mg of protein. LZ (200 M) stimulated in T. spiralis and T.
     Pseudospiralis and MZ (750 uM) in T. spiralis the mATP-ase up to 208, 210 and 240%, of the
     control value, respectively. The relatively weak stimulation of the ATP-ase, but similar to the
     uncoupling effect in those mitochon dria of 80 uM DNP- a classical uncoupler, speaks in favour
     of the possibility of : uncoupling of oxidative phosphorylation by both drugs in Trichinella
     larvae. If this effect could contribute to the overall anthelmintic activity of MZ is still a
     matter of speculations, since the maximal concentration of MZ stimulatory for ATP-ase was
     high.</p>
    <p>Complementary investigations on the influence of these drugs on ATP synthetase using the
     measurements of transmembrane potential in both Trichinella larvae are planned.</p>

     Antihelminthic drugs, electron-microscopic, histochemical studies Recently a new field of
     appliad helminthology began developing in our country connected with histological,
     histochemical and electron-micro- scopic studies of structural and functional disorders in
     tissues and systems of helminths and their hosts caused by various antihelminthic drugs. By far
     not all drugs used in practical medicine and veterinary meet the necessary requrements.
     Helminths become adapted to some of these compounds, which results in a decrease in the
     effectiveness of the latter; others appear to be toxic to the organism of a host. In view of
     this, before introducing new antihelminthic drugs into medical practice it becomes necessary
     besides conventional screening to study structural and functional disorders in the tissues of
     helminths and their hosts unsts under the action of these drugs. Histological, elect-
     ron-microscopic and histochemical studies of tissues of helminths after their exposure to
     antihelminthic drugs will help to elucidate the me- chanism of action of the drug used, to
     determine the ways of its pene- tration, and also to establish the scale of structural
     disturbances caused by the drug. This, in its turn, will give an opportunity to pre- dict the
     "reversibility" or "irreversibility" of morphological studies on the dynamics of changes in the
     organism of the host using the above enumerated methods will make it possible to evaluate the
     toxicity of the preparation.</p>

     Drug sensitivity tests, HPLC, Plasmodium falciparum To study the influence of blood chloroquine
     concentrations in the drug sensitivity assay of Plasmodium falciparum, red blood cells from a
     subject under prophylactic then curative doses of chloroquine were incubated with a
     culture-adapted strain of P. falciparum in a 48-hour radioisotope microdilution test.
     Endogenous chloroquine concentrations were determined in the blood samples and in test cultures
     by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). Controls using normal red blood cells were
     run in parallel. During the prophylactic period, there was no modification in the 50%
     inhibitory concentrations (IC50) of four antimalarials tested. However, during the curative
     period, with plasma chloroquine levels ranging from 470-1124 ng/ml, there was an increased IC50
     to chloroquine (204 nmol/1), quinine (1230 nmol/1), meflo- quine (139.39 nmol/1) and
     halofantrine (22.05 nmol/1). Likewise, the blood concentra- tions of chloroquine were
     significantly elevated in the test system as measured by HPLC. Some parasites have therefore
     survived and multiplied despite the presence of highly "chloroquinized" erythrocytes, thus
     modifying the IC50, possibly by the selec- tion of highly resistant clones.</p>

    <p>Taeniasis, Artocarpus lakoocha, Puag-Haad, 2,4,3,5,-tetrahydroxystilbene
     2,4,3,5,-Tetrahydroxystilbene was prepared by passing the aqueous extract(Puag-Haad) of the
     wood of Artocarpus lakoocha through a column of silica gel CH CI9/MeOH(12:1) as the eluent.
     It(two gram) was con- ducted in 31 Thai patients with taeniasis saginata, aged between 18 and
     46 years and weighing 55.5+9.2 kg. Only slight nausea was observed in 30% of them. The cure
     rate was 61% in comparable with the conventional drug, niclosamide (by Chi square test,
     p=0.55).</p>
    <p>Pharmacokinetics of 2,4,3,5-tetrahydroxystibene(TS) was carried out in three healthy
     volunteers aged between 27 and 43 years and weighing 53-63 kg. Three grams of TS was given
     orally after eight-hour fasting.</p>
    <p>Plasma and urine TS was analysed by HPLC. Only 0.06% of the drug taken was absorbed with the
     maximum concentration of 25.1 ug/ml at 2 hr.</p>
    <p>Absorption half-life was 25.2 min and terminal elimination half-life of 6.05 hr was observed.
     Renal clearance was 36.68 ml/hr with the cumulative urinary TS excretion of 1.94 mg
     (0.06%).</p>
    <p>We concluded that 2,4,3,5-tetrahydroxystibene was well tolerated and very small amount of the
     drug was absorbed: Furthermore, TS is cheaper than niclosamide and locally available.
     Therefore, it is an ideal drug for the treatment of taeniasis saginata, particularly in
     Thailand.</p>

    <p>amphotericin B, polyene antibiotic, Leishmania, heat shock We have carried out a comparative
     study of the effect of the polyene antibiotic amphote- ricin B (AmB) on the viability of
     Leishmania mexicana promastigotes (LP) ,before and after their transformation into
     amastigote-Tike forms by elevation of temperature(heat shock response). For this purpose,
     Leishmania promastigotes were grown at 23°C in a li- quid LIT medium,supplemented with 5%(v/v)
     fetal bovine serum.Parasites in the exponential phase were harvested by centrifugation,washed
     and incubated in medium 199 at 37°C for six hours.The kinetics of cell death was followed by
     spectrofluorometry with the nucleic acid binding compound ethidium bromide. The binding of AmB
     to plasma membrane vesicles prepa- red from LP and heat-transformed cells was measured by
     circular dichroism. It was found that the rapid Killing effect that is exerted by AmB on LP was
     even faster after their transformation into amastigote-like forms by heat. From the Scatchard
     plot of AmB binding to Leishmania vesicles (in the 0.5 to 1.0 AmB concentration range), it can
     be deduced that twice more AmB molecules are bound to Leishmania promastigotes than to
     amastigote- like forms. On the other hand, determination of the ergosterol content of the
     plasma mem- brane in both types of cells indicated that the ergosterol/vhospholipid ratio was
     reduced by four times after cell transformation. Therefore, neither the amount of AmB molecules
     bound to cells nor the membrane sterol content is a factor determining their sensitivity.</p>
    <p>Changes in the membrane lipid packing could be at the origin of the changes of sensitivi- ty
     of Leishmania mexicana to the lethal action of AmB.</p>

     reported to appear within 2 to 4 days of administration.</p>
    <p>Cyclosporin À is also a powerful immunosuppressant with a relatively little effect on the
     bone marrow. Both, Azathioprine and Cyclosporin A, are used to prolong the survival of organ
     and tissue transplants, and some auto-immune disease. In T.cruzi infect mice three different
     groups (6 animals per group), were used! a- control (T.cruzi infected animals), b- animals
     receiving the drug 4 days prior the infection with T.cruzi and c- animals infected with T.cruzi
     and receiving the drug in the same day.</p>
    <p>The course of the parasitaemia was determined by counting the number of parasites present in
     one drop of fresh blood from the mouse tail. Morta- lity rates were also recorded. The results
     shown that both drugs are able to induce hight parasitaemia that increased in the order of 250%
     for the group ce and 300% for the group b. Mortality rates also followed the parasitaemia
     results. These results are considered of interest in two aspects: 12) clinical, due to the
     possibility of chagasic people receive the immunosuppressant drugs; 22) use of these compounds
     for obtain mass Of cells for biochemical studies.</p>

     COMPOUNDS K.P. Davies, H. Zahner and P. Kôhler. Institute of Parasitology, University of Zürich
     Winterthurerstrasse 266a, 8057 Zürich, Switzerland Antifilarials - Benzothiazole - Mode of
     action - Mitochondrial function + Acetylcholinesterase In this study the molecular modes of
     action of a series of new antifilarials, based on a 2-tert- butyl-benzothiazole ring structure,
     were investigated. Of these compounds, the benzothiazole dithiocarbamic acid ester, CGP 20376,
     is the most advanced in clinical trials. Our investigations suggest that this drug requires
     conversion to the corresponding isothiocyanate, CGP 20308, before exerting any antiparasitic
     effect. This occurs spontaneously in neutral aqueous solution.</p>
    <p>The highly hydrophobic benzothiazole isothiocyanates were found to cause extensive and rapid
     swelling of isolated rat liver mitochondria, probably by a physical disturbance of the
     mitochondrial membrane structure. The isothiocyanate derivatives have also been found to
     inhibit mitochondrial respiration and energy conservation (Davies et al. 1989, Exp.
     Parasitol.</p>
    <p>68, 382-391), and to decrease the levels of metabolites derived from glucose oxidation, such
     as acetyl-CoA and acetylcholine. Another series of antifilarials contain a thiourea group as a
     characteristic substituent in the benzothiazole ring (e.g. CGP 21833). These compounds were
     found to inhibit the acetylcholinesterase by competing with its substrate, acetylcholine..
     There is also evidence that these drugs are metabolised to their isothiocyanate analogs by an
     enzyme present in mammalian liver. They may therefore exert effects similar to those described
     for the isothiocyanate, CGP 20308. Thus, it appears that the principal molecular action of the
     benzothiazole antifilarial compounds is to impair mitochondrial function. This is consistent
     with previous ultrastructural observations of filarial worms treated with these compounds
     (Franz et al. 1987, Trop. Med. Parasitoi. 38, 1-7). The biochemical effects of the antifilarial
     compounds were not significantly different between the mammalian and parasite test systems.</p>
    <p>Pharmacokinetic studies suggest that the selective toxicity of the benzothiazole
     antifilarials towards the parasite is due to selective uptake and accumulation.</p>

     mesurées régulièrement dès J2, par retroculture de dilutions successives du sang et des
     organes. Avec DDS ou PYR seules, la survie moyenne des souris est prolongée comparativement au
     groupe contrôle, mais les charges parasitaires sont élevées au niveau du poumon et du cerveau.
     L'association DDS/PYR administrée à J1 permet la survie de 100% des souris et les charges
     parasitaires restent négatives sauf à J4 au niveau du cerveau. Administrée à J4, DDS/PYR
     entraine une négativation des charges parasitaires de J10 à J21; à J30 (15 jours après l'arrêt
     du traitement), une rechute est observée, mise en évidence par une augmentation des charges
     parasitaires dans les tissus. Ces résultats sont comparables à ceux obtenus avec l'association
     sulfadiazine/PYR, aussi bien in vitro qu'in vivo. Compte tenu de la plus longue demi-vie de DDS
     chez l'homme, de sa meilleure tolérance chez les sidéens et de son activité sur P.carinii,

    <p>Chemotherapy is of crucial importance in schistosomiasis control programmes, with
     praziquantel (PZQ) and oxamniquine (OX) the two drugs now available for use against S. mansoni.
     Drug action js not wel} understood, but recent work has indicated that both PZQ and OX are
     immune-dependent. They are less effective against patent S.</p>
    <p>mansoni infections in immunosuppressed T-cell deprived mice, and the effects of sub- curative
     doses of both are enhanced by injections of immune sera given simultan- eously with drug
     administration. JIndirect imnunofluorescence indicates that P7Q causes focal erosion of the
     worm surface, particularly over male dorsal tubercles, thus exposing antigens sensitive to
     synergistically active antibodies. One such target, identified and partially characterized with
     the use of specific sera, is à 27kKD esterase. A molecule with related antigenicily appears to
     be present on the surface of S. mansoni schistosomula. Not all antigens which PZQ causes to be
     exposed on tbe worm surface are sensitive to immune attack, however, since antibodies against
     S. mansoni atkaline phosphatase which similarly stain the surface of drug-treated worms are not
     synergistically active. Consideration will be given Lo ways in which the concept of
     immune-dependent drug action can exploïited to generate novel slralegic alternatives for the
     control of schistosomiasis.</p>

    <p>Onchocerca volvulus - Onchocerciasis - Ivermectin This work concerns the effects of
     ivermectin on adult 0. volvulus. Nodules removed 2 weeks to 6 months after treatment were fixed
     in 60% ethanol/10% glycerol and digested in 0.3% collagenase to extract adult worms, which were
     stained with Mayer’s haemalum and brought up into glycerol. The females were unravelled in 5-6
     cm lengths for direct longitudinal microscopic examination. Worms were then cut into 0.5 cm
     lengths, implanted sequentially into slits in blocks of veal brain white matter, sectioned at 6
     um and stained for study of transverse sections.</p>
    <p>Normal patterns of embryogenesis in untreated worms had been assessed previously. In fecund
     females, ivermectin paralyses intra-uterine microfilariae, prevents their exodus and leads to
     their degeneration. Study of this phenomenon over time indicated that:-the gestation period of
     microfilariae is about 8 weeks; about half the erstwhile fecund worms had recommenced
     productive embryogenesis 4 months after treatment; and uninseminated females shedding ova which
     degenerate are unaffected by the drug.</p>
    <p>As early as 2 weeks after ivermectin at 200 mcg/kg, the number of male worms in nodules fell
     by 10-50%. Presumably those not trapped in nodules moved away and, since they had not returned
     after 4 or more months, they may have died in extranodular sites. Repeated ivermectin at
     100-200 mcg/kg increased the proportion of dead (D) or moribund (M) adult worms to
     statistically significant levels after 12 monthly doses (22% of females and 12% of males M or
     D). However, surviving worms appeared healthy, sugéesting that the drug had an action of slow
     attrition on particularly susceptible (?older) worms. This possibility needs investigating in
     control programs using 6- or 12-monthly ivermectin dosage.</p>

    <p>INHI5IT{ON POTENTIELLE Dr LA PEPCK DE E.MULTILOCULARIS PAR DES COMPLEXANTS DE METAUX

     phosphoënolpyruvique(PEP) et Xe transforme en oxaloacé- tate. Cet enzyme nécessite la présence
     d'un métal divalent (Mn ou Mg ). L'acétylacé- tone est un complexant classique de ces deux
     métaux et en relation avec la structure pyruvique, nous avons étudié l'effet sur la PEPCK de
     l'énolate sodique de l'acétyl-3 py- ruvate d'éthyle(composé 1) et du dérivé disodique de
     l'acide acétyl-3 pyruvique(compo- sé 2). Le composé 1 a été obtenu par réaction de Claisen
     entre l'acétone et l'oxalate d'éthyle en présence d'éthylate de sodium; par saponification, il
     fournit le composé 2.</p>
    <p>Le pouvoir inhibiteur potentiel de ces deux dérivés est apprécié par dosage spectropho-
     tométrique de l'activité enzymatique dans le sens de la carboxylation. Plusieurs concen-
     trations de chaque composé (1, 2, 5 mM) sont étudiées aux pH 6,8 et 8 et en présence soit
     primés en pourcentage d'inhibition par rapport à l'activité du témoin. L'activité inhi- bitrice
     potentielle des composés 1 et 2 est fonction des différents facteurs envisagés, Par exemple, le
     composé 2(5 mM), en présence de MnCl, à pH=8, entraîne 91% d'inhibition chez le parasite et 46%
     chez l'hôte.En présence de MgCl, à pH=6,8, le composé 2(1 mM) fournit 74% d'inhibition chez le
     parasite et 26% chez l*hôte, alors qu'à la même concen- tration à pH=8, l'inhibition chez le
     parasite n'est que de 10% et nulle chez l'hôte. Le composé 2 possède une fonction acide
     carboxylique libre et pourrait donc se lier à un site enzymatique du PEP qui doit lui même
     posséder un COOH libre pour se lier à la PEPCK 1037 S9.A - Les antiparasitaires ; orientations

    <p>Le aéveloppement de l'hydatide de Echinococcus multilocularis est partiellement entravé par
     la trifluopérazine(TFP) dont la molécule présente une chaîne méthylpipérazinopropyle fixée sur
     l'azote d'une phénothiazine,. Afin d'étudier les influences du chaînon carboné et de la nature
     du cycle sur l'activité antiparasitaire, vingt alkylamino-éthers R-0-(CH,) -N (n=2 ou 3), où R
     est un reste cyclohexanique, phénoxycyclohexanique, couma- rinique où une chromone, sont
     synthétisés par réaction entre des amines chlorées et un dérivé hydroxylé(par transfert de
     phase pour les dérivés cyclohexaniques ou en présence de k, C0 pour les dérivés phénoliques).
     L'activité antihydatique comparée des produits ou fermées. On mesure le temps de survie des
     protoscolex des deux types d'hydatides par rapport à des protoscolex non traités ou traités au
     TFP. Les éthers de phénols sous forme de base, qui sont les plus lipophiles des composés
     testés, présentent une activité équivalente à celle des oxalates d'amino-éthers d'alcools;
     cette activité est estimée aux 2/3 de celle de la TFP prise comme référence. Les plus
     lipophiles des oxalates d'amino-éthers phénoxycyclohexaniques sont les plus actifs. Ainsi pour
     le composé DP 14 (n=2; N = pipéridine), l'activité in vitro est estimée égale aux 8/10 de celle
     de la DP 14 présente un effet parasitostatique sans l'effet neuroleptique prononcé de la
     TFP.</p>
    <p>En fin de traitement, l'étude histologique des parasites montre que de nombreux proto- scolex
     sont altérés. Les analogues cyclohexaniques, coumariniques ou chromone du DP 14 présentent une
     activité moindre.</p>

    <p>Cleavage of cattle erythrocytes sialic acid by Trypanosoma vivax sialidase during infection
     caused anaemia. The higher erythrocytes sialic acids in the Ndama than the Zebu cattle, and the
     existence of another type of sialic acids on the Ndama erythrocytes, absent on the zebu
     erythrocytes, were associated with the trypanotolerance of the Ndama cattle. For development of
     anti-trypanosome-sialidase chemotherapy, to avoid host toxicity from such chemotherapeutic
     agent, we investigated the production and types of sialidases in the intestinal mucosa cells of
     goats, cattle and dogs, since sialic acids are rapidly absorbed through the intestinal walls.
     Sialidase activities, as sialic acids cleaved from substrates, were 2.11 Units in the
     intestinal contents of goats; 3.72 + 2.6L Units in the small and 1.5 + 1.08 Units in the large
     intestinal contents, respectively, of cattle; but higher 8.15 + O.lh Units in the small and
     L.07 + 1.18 Units in the large intestinal contents, respectively, of dogs. The latter higher
     activities in dogs were atributable to their carmmivorous diets, since sialic acids might be
     hydrolysed from glycoproteins/glycoconjugates of the digsested foods, for absorption.</p>
    <p>It was only in the goats that magnessium-and calcium-induced sialidase activities of 1.38 —
     2.06 Units and 1.79 = 2.09 Units were detected in the mcosa cells of their small and large
     intestines, respectively. Sialidase activity was not detected in the intestinal mucosa cells of
     cattle and dogs, even in the presence of Mgt+t and Cat, The development of
     anti-trypanosome-sialidase chemotherany against African animal trypanosomiasis is feasible.</p>

     Interferon gamma - Pharmacokinetics The association of recombinant interferon gamma (rIFN-Y,
     Roussel-Uclaf, France) with a pentavalent antimonial drug (Sbv, glucantime, Rhône-Poulenc,
     France) is effective in treating seriously ill patients with refractory or previously untreated
     visceral leishmaniasis (N. Engl. J. Med., 1990, 322:16-21).</p>
    <p>In order to elucidate the mechanism of action of this combination, we have studied some
     pharmacokinetic parameters of Sbv in mice (100 mg/kg) given alone or simultaneously with 5,000
     mouse units of rIFN-y (Roussel-Uclaf).</p>
    <p>Quantification of Sbv was performed by atomic absorption spectrometry for concentrations
     lower than 5 ug/ ml or emision spectrometry with argon plasma source for samples with higher
     amounts. Organs (spleen, liver, kidney) were first digested with (OH)K and mineralised
     afterwards at 500°C. Residues are dissolved in nitric acid and submitted to spectrometry.</p>
    <p>In the presence of IFN-Y, at two hours post injection, increased levels of Sbv are detected
     in serum (2.2-fold), spleen (3.8-fold), liver (4-fold) and kidney (2-fold). These results show
     that IFN-Y significantly modified the pharmacokinetic of Sbv.</p>

    <p>Malaria - Mitochondria - Electron Transport - Hydroxynaphthoquinone For the first time
     purified mitochondrial fractions have been prepared from intraerythro- cytic trophozoites of
     Plasmodium falciparum and Plasmodium yoelii, and characterized with regard to substrates,
     inhibitors, and cytochrome content. This knowledge has allowed the site of action of the
     antimalarial hydroxynaphthoquinone, 566C80, to be confirmed as the cytochrome bc;-complex
     (Complex Ill) of the malaria mitochondrial electron transport chain. The concentra- tion of
     566C80 required to inhibit the malaria respiratory chain suggests one binding site for the drug
     in the cytochrome bc; -complex (approx. 0.5 mol 566C80/mol cytochrome b); 566C80 inhibition of
     the malaria bc; -complex is at least 500 times greater than the corresponding rat liver

     Oxygen, Anthelmintic The oxidation of the C(14,15) double bond in milbemycins by singlet oxygen
     and subsequent reduction in situ of the intermediate peroxides by triphenyl phosphine leads to
     two of three conceivable products : 15-hydroxy milbemycin with an exocyclic double bond
     C(14,29j as the major product, and its isomer, 14-hydroxy milbemycin with a C(15,16) double
     bond.</p>
    <p>The other possible isomer, 15-hydroxy milbemycin with a C(13,14) double bond, has not been
     observed.</p>
    <p>The major product of this singlet oxygen oxidation is an ideal intermediate for the
     introduction of substituents at C(29): treatment of the mesylated analog with various
     nucleophiles leads to a variety of derivatives of milbemycins which are substituted at carbon
     C(29).</p>
    <p>E.g. treatment with alcohols leads to the C(29)-ethers, reaction with carboxylates gives
     C(29)-esters and the allylic substitution with water gives the C(29)-alcohol, which itself is
     the intermediate of a number of new derivatives of milbemycins with potential antiparasitic
     activity, e.g. C(29)-carbonates and C(29)-carbamates.</p>

     Australia Plasmodium; NBMPR; adenosine analogues The emergence of strains of malaria resistant
     to current drugs has highlighted the need for new therapeutic agents. We have been
     investigating the effect of purine and pyrimidine antimetabolites in Plasmodium falciparum
     (human malaria) with the aim of developing alternative chemotherapeutic approaches. The purine
     anti-metabolite, tubercidin (7-deazaadenosine) was previously shown to be an effective
     anti-parasitic agent in in vitro culture but at concentrations that were unacceptable to the
     host. We have now explored the use of the nucleoside transport inhibitor NBMPR
     (nitrobenzylthioinosine) in combination with tubercidin ( and thirty seven nucleoside
     derivatives obtained from Walter Reed Army Institute for Research and the National Cancer
     Institute, Washington DC ) against both chloroquine sensitive (FCQ-27) and resistant (K-1)
     strains for its potential in reducing the host toxicity of tubercidin and other nucleoside
     analogs. Structure-activity relationships suggested that substituents on the C8 position of the
     purine ring were advantageous in the modification of adenosine to a cytotoxic analogue.</p>
    <p>In vivo trials in Balb C mice infected with P. berghei demonstrated that a combination of
     several of the new potentially cytotoxic nucleosides and NBMPR (or Dilazep) prolonged the life
     of infected mice and significantly reduced the parasitemia.</p>

    <p>105, 6.8 x 105 and 1.0 x 107 M, respectively. An additive effect occurred with azithromycin
     or CP- 63956 in combination with chloroquine, but this was not seen with erythromycin. ainst
     the chloroquine- sensitive FCMSU, strain of P. falciparum the IC., values for the
     aforementioned drugs were 3.8 x 105, 5.0 x 105, 7.3 x 106 and 4.2 x 108 M, - respectively. în a
     murine model infected with a chlorouine-resistant strain of Plasmodium berghei, IC, values for
     azithromycin, CP-63956, erythromycin and chloroquine during a 4-day test were 5.9, 54, 350 and
     62 mg/kg/day respectively. Values obtained against a chloroquine-sensitive strain of P. berghei
     were 17.4, 18.0, 442 and 1.5 mg/kg, respectively. Azithromycin or CP-63956 in combination with
     chloroquine displayed an additive effect against both strains of P.</p>
    <p>berghei, but this additive effect did not occur with erythromycin. These results indicate
     that compared with erythromycin, the new macrolide antibiotics are more effective at low
     concentrations against chloroquine-resistant malarial parasites and when combined with
     chloroquine are more potent than erythromycin plus chloroauine.</p>

    <p>Suckling mice and newborn calves suffering from cryptosporidiosis after experimental
     infection, and treatment with 15 mg/kg body weight of the ionophorous polyetherantibiotic
     lasalocid' sodium salt suspended in water or milk respectively, once per day during 3 days by
     means of a stomach tube, were tested for 10 days, wether shedding cryptosporidia with feces and
     showing developmental stages of Cryptosporidium parvum in the intestinal mucosa, by light and
     electron microscopy. 48 h following treatment intracellular stages were less frequent;
     morphological abnormalities were visible in cryptosporidia as com- pared to untreated controls.
     Parasites being affected only in part those changes were found in nearly any stage of
     intracellular development. They were most obvious in the endoplasmic reticulum, perinuclear
     space and micronemes. Distension and vacuolization of the organelles as well as reduced
     contrast of their membranes were predominant. In many cases formation of vacuoles extended to
     the surrounding cytoplasm and sporadically caused almost complete lysis of cell contents.
     Frequently together with vacuolization the cytoplasm showed increased osmiophilia. Oocysts and
     sporocysts are very sensitive to lasalocid. But due to the complex construction of their
     pellicular membranes they are extremely resistent to the environmental influences and therefore
     insensitive to all desinfectants and all other therapeutics tested. The alterations in all
     stationary developmental stages, especially in oocysts and sporocysts, indicate that free
     living stages are exposed to lasalocid, but, however, the cell damages induced are morphologic-
     ally visible in later developmental stages only.</p>

    <p>Pneumocystis carinii - pneumonia - hydroxynaphthoquinone - experimental chemotherapy Until
     recently, Pneumocystis carinii pneumoniä (PCP) was regarded as a relatively rare perasitic
     infection ceer occasiorally in infants and in immunocompromised adults. It could be cortrollec
     readily either with pentamidine or with cotrimoxazole, the latter beirg preferred because of
     its oral bioavailability and its low level of adverse reactions. With the advent of AIDS in the
     1980s, the magnitude of the PCP problem increased enormously. First, about 70% of these
     immunocompromised patients develop PCP, which is fatal if untreated. Second, for reasons that
     are still not clear, frequencies of serious adverse reactions with cotrimoxazole and
     pentamidine increased to around 60% with AIDS patients. Clearly, there is an urgent need for
     new drugs for the prophylaxis and therapy of PCP which are both highly efficacious and free
     from serious adverse reactions. We report here the efficacy of a new compound in the rodent
     model of PCP which comes from a class of drugs strikingly different from those of other
     anti-P.carinii agents. The compound, 2-[trans-4-(4-chlorophenyl) cyclohexyl]-3-
     hydroxy-1,4-naphthoquinone, 566C80, already in clinical trials as an antimalarial, is effective
     by the oral route in both the prevention and treatment of PCP in the rat without obvious
     toxicity. Drug can be delivered either by gavage or in the diet.</p>
    <p>Doses for complete suppression of infection are in the 10-100mg/kg range. Unlike
     cotrimoxazole and pertamidine, 566C80 appears to be cidal rather than static.</p>

    <p>Benzimidazole, Trichinella spiralis, colchicine binding assay, tubulin.</p>
    <p>The effect of mebendazole (MBZ), oxibendazole (0BZ), albendazole (ABZ), febendazole (FBZ) and
     luxabendazole (LBZ) on microtubular proteins of Trichinella spiralis muscle stage larvae has
     been studied by the colchicine binding assay. To test this effect aliquots of T. spiralis
     muscle larvae crude extracts were incubated with several colchicine concentrations in absence
     and presence of benzimidazole. Besides, inhibition of colchicine binding by Podophylotoxin
     (PDPT) was studied to ensure that the binding observed in crude extract was due to tubulin.
     Analysis of data by means of double reciprocal plots showed the existence of a competitive
     inhibition of colchicine binding to T. spiralis crude extract by PDPT. These date strongly
     suggest that the tubulin is the binding agent in parasite extracts. On the other hand, we have
     confirmed that the inhibition microtubule assembly is the most probable mode of action for
     benzimidazoles.</p>
    <p>We demonstrated that this inhibition is of a competitive nature. However, the studied
     benzimidazoles showed different inhibitory capacity since the strongest inhibitor of colchicine
     binding to parasite tubulin was LBZ (Ki=0.9x10-7M), followed by MBZ (Ki=1.4x10-7M), OBZ
     (Ki=2.9x10-7M), ABZ (Ki=6.5x10-/M) and FBZ (Ki=3.9x10-6M) in decreasing order to activity.
     Finally, a study on inhibition of colchicine-binding to pig brain tubulin with the same
     benzimidazoles confirmed previous reports by other authors in the sense that benzimidazoles
     inhibit colchicine binding to mammalian brain tubulin in a lesser degree than they do to
     nematode tubulin.</p>

     vaginalis Berberine, a plant alkaloid derived from Coptis teeta or Berberis aristata has been
     used as an anti-diarrheal medication by traditional practitioners of medicine in south-east
     asia. A berberine salt, berberine sulfate, was found to inhibit the growth of Entamoeba
     histolytica, Giardia lamblia and Trichomonas vaginalis in axenic culture. Degeneration of
     treated parasites was observed by light and electron microscopy. Cytoplasmic changes and a
     clumping of nuclear chromatin occurred in E. histolytica. An irregularly shaped vacuole
     appeared in the cytoplasm of G. lamblia, and enlarged gradually. Formation of enlarged vacuoles
     in the cytoplasm of T. vaginalis Was characteristic of damage to this parasite.</p>
    <p>Even though the three parasites showed different degenerative process, present observations
     confirmed that berberine sulfate has direct anti-protozoal activity. Based on these results, we
     concluded that berberine sulfate may be useful as a chemotherapeutic agent against these
     parasites.</p>

    <p>Tetracycline Quinine Plasma Levels Quinine has been an effective drug for severe
     chloroquine-resistant falciparun malaria. However, there was a decline in the sensitivity of
     plasmodium falciparum to quinine. The combination of quinine and tetracycline has improved the
     cure rate to 95-100%. However, the mechanism that is responsible for this has never been
     identified. We have compared plasma quinine levels on day 2, day 5 and day 7 (before and at 2
     hours after dosing) in twenty one patients with acute falciparum malaria who were treated with
     quinine alone (8 patients) or quinine in combination with tetracycline (8 patients) or quinine
     with tetracycline and primaquine (5 patients).</p>
    <p>All patients who received combination of quinine and tetracycline with or without primaquine
     responded well to the treatment with no recrudescence. Two patients who were treated with
     quinine alone had RI respense.</p>
    <p>Plasma quinine concentrations from quinine alone group were significantly lower than those
     obtained from combination groups on day 2, 5 and 7. The minimal plasma quinine levels from
     quinine alone group were all lower than MIC ie. below 10 ug/ml whilse those obtained from the
     combination group vere higher than MIC for 7 days.</p>
    <p>These results suggest that tetracycline has influence on the maintenance of plasma quinine
     levels to be above MIC throughout the treatment period with a better cure rate as a
     consequence.</p>

    <p>Pharmacokinetics Pharmacodynamics Mefloquine A double blind randomised comparative study of
     the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of mefloquine 750 mg versus 1250 mg was performed in
     twenty patients with acute uncomplicated falciparum malaria aged between 16 and 42 years and
     weighing 45-60 kg. A similar therapeutic response were seen in both groups. However, the higher
     dose produced more side effects (digziness, dirrhoea, bradycardia and sinus arrhythmia).</p>
    <p>There were no statistically sinificant differences in any pharmacokinetic parameter between
     the two groups; hokever, Cmax and AUC were higher after 1250 ng. Vomiting within the first hour
     influenced mefloquine concentrations, resulting in significantly lower AUC.</p>
    <p>These results do not indicate any advantage in using 1250 mg mefloquine rather than 750 ng as
     single dose treatment. The dose of 1250 mg should be fractionated as recommended by the
     manufacturer. In Western Thailand where P.</p>
    <p>falciparum is susceptible, a single dose of 750 mg is adequate; however, in Eastern Thailand
     where parasites are becoming resistant a fractionated dose of 1250 mg is recommended.</p>

     of the possible reasons of the failure in treatment of giardiasis may be the heterogeneity in
     the response of Giardia populations to drugs. We compared the Sensitivity of stocks and their
     cloned lines of Giardia to metronidazole and ornidazole in vitro. Seven stocks of Giardia were
     used; two stocks of G. intestinalis from human represented extreme sensitivity of the parasite
     to the anti-giardial drugs (one is very sensitive and the other is highly resistant). The
     remaining five stocks of Giardia were isolated from zoo animals (rodents and monkeys). Five
     clones were each derived from two human and from three animal Giardia stocks. Our study reveals
     that all seven stocks of Giardia studied, irrespective of host from which they had been
     isolated, differ in their sensitivity to the drugs commonly used in therapy of giardiasis. The
     differences were greater with ornidazole than with metronidazole; however, the activity of
     these drugs did not correlate. Five Giardia stocks investigated ôäïin their composition of
     populations proved to be heterogeneous with, respect to the sernisitivity to both drugs. In
     most sets the parent stocks were either more sensitive or less sensitive than all their clones;
     only in one set of clones the parent stock showed the medium value of sensitivity to
     ornidazole. We found a positive correlation between the in vitro high resistance of all clones
     of one parent stock to both nitroimidazoles and treatment failures of giardiasis in the patient
     from which the parasite stock had been isolated.</p>

    <p>AI forms of lelshmaniasis are initially treated with sodium stibogluconate or N-methyl
     glucanime antimonate. Treatment failures or relapses occur and repeated administrations are
     expensive and toxic. Indigenous plant extracts, obtained from Central Drug Research Institute,
     Lucknow, India, such as fractions of Tephrosia purpurae (Alcoholic and Butanol fractions) Piper
     longum, Calotropis procera and Amoora rohitika which have been used in local indigenous medical
     practice were tested for their antileishmanial activity in vitro in mouse peritoneal
     macrophages and in vivo in BALB/C mice infected with {eishmania donovani.</p>
    <p>In vitro results revealed that a concentration of 350 ug/ml of alcoholic and 300 ug/ml of
     butanol fraction of Tephrosia purpurae were effective, in comparision to sodium stibogluconate
     which was effective at a concentration of 80 ug/mli. In vivo, in BALB/C mice infected with L.
     donovani these drugs were effective at dosages of 130 mg and 150 mg/kg body weight given for 5
     days intraperitoneally, 21 days after infection. Butanol fraction of T. purpurae was found to
     be the most effective antileishmanial drug at a dosage of 150 mg/kg body weight. Sodium
     stibogluconate was effective at a lower dosage of 40 mg/kg body weight. Though higher dosages
     of indigenous drugs are required for effective curing, these will prove useful as alternate
     secondary therapy.</p>

     Adult females from an untreated donor and larvae, when confined in rings on a treated calf, fed
     to engorgement although they were smaller than normal, Despite this relatively normal
     engorgement, the larvae did not moult and again, the females did not Lay eggs. Moulting ticks
     were the most sensitive to CGA 157419 and this stage was chosen for most of the biochemical and
     ultrastructural study, Incorporation of T4 N-acetyl glucosamine (NAG) into the cuticle of
     moulting nymphs was demonstrated using a whole cell system. This was despite the Low chitin
     content reported for tick cuticle (4%) compared to insects (40%). ÇGA 157419 at a 1uM
     concentration caused a 50 % reduction in the incorporation of NAG into tick cuticle.</p>
    <p>In ultrastructure, alteration to the cuticle of both feeding adults and moulting ticks was

     4-aminoquinoline combinations, in vitro Although erythromycin has been reported to be active
     against Plasmodium falciparum in vitro when given alone or with chloroquine, it has been
     difficult to demonstrate a beneficial effect for the combination of erythromycin and
     chloroquine when used for the treatment of P. falciparum infections in humans. In order to
     reassess the interaction of a 4-aminoquinoline and erythromycin combination in vitro we
     developed a 71-day test of parasite sensitivity. The test was designed, within the constraints
     of the in vitro system, to reproduce the dosage regimen given in vivo. Eight isolates of
     P.falciparum from the Kenyan coast were culture-adapted and exposed to erythromycin with
     chloroquine or with amodiaquine. The interaction of the drugs was evaluated by plotting the
     concentration of each drug needed to inhibit parasite growth. In seven isolates the combination
     of chloroquine and erythromycin was antagonistic; One isolate showed slight synergy. The
     combination of amodiaquine and erythromycin was synergistic in three isolates but antagonistic
     in five. An antagonistic interaction may explain why erythromycin does not enhance chloroquine

    <p>A majority of the rural population in Mali still rely almost exclusively on traditional

     was investigated in a clinical study in the Selingue area. 53 patients (5-45 years old)
     included in the study were infected with Plasmodium falciparum and had clinical symptoms of
     malaria. All had parasitaemia of 5000 or more parasites per cuber mm of finger blood and a
     negative Dill-Glasko urine test for chloroquine, amodiaquine, quinine, quinidine and
     mefloquine. ‘Suma-kala'' decoction or chloroquine tablets were administered orally in 7 days
     regime. The patients were informed that both forms of treatment were the same herbal remedy in
     two different formulations. 35 patients received 10 g of ‘'suma-kala'" twice a day for 4 days
     and once a day for 3 days.</p>
    <p>17 patients were treated with chloroquine diphosphate (10 mg per kg) once a day for 3 days
     and empty placebo capsule for 4 days. The study showed that although the treatment with
     ‘“suma-kala'"' resulted in significant reduction of parasitaemia, it was less effective than
     the treatment with chloroquine. However, its efficiency in controlling clinical symptoms such
     as fever, vomiting, headache, shivering and nausea could not be distinguished from that of
     chloroquine. The results of this trial indicate that "suma-kala" has indeed some beneficial
     effects in the treatment of malaria and justify further studies on medicinal plants used to

    <p>Netobimin (NTB) is a hydrosoluble drug that can be formulated either for oral or parenteral
     administration. The cyclisation of NTB in the host may be crucial for both the pharmacokinetic
     profile of active metabolites and the resultant broad-spectrum anthelmintic activity of NTB. To
     evaluate the comparative disposition and bio- availability of NTB and its metabolites, a
     zwitterion suspension of NTB was given intraruminally (IR) to sheep and orally to cattle at 20
     mg/kg and a trisamine solution of NTB was administered subcutaneously (SC) to sheep (20 mg/kg)
     and cattle (12.5 mg/kg).</p>
    <p>Plasma concentrations of NTB, albendazole (ABZ), ABZ sulphoxide (ABZSO) and ABZ sulphone
     (ABZSO2) were determined by HPLC. The pharmacokinetic analysis was based on non- compartmental
     methods. ABZ was only detected after IR treatment in sheep. ABZSO and ABZSO) were the principal
     metabolites found in plasma after either oral or parenteral administration of NTB in both
     species. Parenteral treatments resulted in significantly lower AUC and Cmax for ABZSO and
     ABZSO) than oral (or IR) treatments in both species.</p>
    <p>In cattle, ABZSO resulted in lower AUC and shorter mean residence time. The ratio of AUC for
     ABZSO2/ABZSO was higher in cattle than in sheep. In conclusion, oral or IR administration
     results in a higher NTB conversion into ABZ metabolites than SC administration in both species.
     The cattle appeared to have a greater oxidizing capacity that resulted in a faster disposition

    <p>Cyclosporin À. Echinococcus multilocularis Patients with E.multilocularis echinococcosis are
     treated with CsA when receiving a liver transplantation. CsA has been shown to exert beneficial
     or adverse effects on experimental parasitic diseases. These effects are sometimes related to
     the immunosuppressive properties of the drug, and sometimes to a direct antiparasitic activity.
     However, its effects on alveolar echinococcosis remain unknown.</p>
    <p>Therefore, we studied the influence of CsA on larval growth of E.multilo- cularis and on
     specific immunity of the host in AKR mice. 2 groups of mice were treated with 40 mg/kg/day, by
     subcutaneous injections, at the 45th day after an intra-peritoneal infestation (group 1) or
     immediately before infestation. Results showed that CsA had no antiparasitic effect on the
     larval growth. The parasitic load, unmodified in group 1, was signifi- cantly enhanced as
     compared to that of control mice in group 2. This enhancement was associated with a decrease in
     specific antibody levels, whereas the specific delayed-type hypersensitivity was decreased in
     the 2 groups.</p>
    <p>These results incitate to follow up carefully patients with alveolar echinococcosis after
     liver transplantation.</p>

    <p>The flavoenzyme glutathione reductase (EC.1.6.4.2) is responsible for maintaining a high
     level of reduced glutathione which is essential for the function of glutathione-linked enzymes.
     These enzymes have an important role in protecting parasitic helminths from oxidative damage
     caused by the host's immune system. Glutathione reductase has been purified by anion-exchange
     and affinity chromatography. SDS polyacrylamide gel electro- phoresis of the purified enzyme
     showed a single band. The pH optimum, buffer effects, reaction kinetics and substrate
     specificity are being investigated. It is hoped that assessment of differences found between
     the cestode and mammalian enzymes will show features that can be exploited in anthelmintic
     design.</p>

     including ciliates, myxosporidia, micro- sporidia, and very important monogeneans. The results
     after application within the food and as addition in a medical bath were compared. The cure
     rates as well as the effects on the treated parasites were documented by light and electron
     microscopy. As result it turned out that the use of an 1-4 hours medical bath containing 1-10
     ppm/1 of the drug was significantly superior to the diet application and led to complete cure
     in about 20 parasitic infections.</p>

    <p>Giardia, Albendazole, In vitro, In vivo There is presently only a limited range of
     chemotherapeutic agents available for the treatment of Giardia infections. These comprise
     metronidazole and related nitroimida- zoles, quinacrine and furazolidone, none of which are
     totally satisfactory. There is an obvious need for alternative antigiardial agents. In this
     study, the effects of albendazole were assessed against Giardia in vitro and compared with
     those of tinidazole and metronidazole. Trophozoite morphology, adherence and viability were
     markedly affected by albendazole and to a far greater extent than either metronidazole or
     tinida- zole. Albendazole was found to be very effective in treating Giardia infections in vivo
     using a rodent model. In addition, Trichomonas vaginalis was adversely affected by albendazole
     in vitro. The results of these studies suggest the potential for a new approach to the
     chemotherapy of giardiasis and other protozoan infections.</p>

    <p>The action of anthelmintic drug praziquanthel on adult cestode Difhyl- lobothrium latum was
     studied. The golden hampsters were infected with perocercoids of D. latum.The experimental
     animals were feed with 25 mg per kg of praziquanthel in starch gel after one month of the
     worms’s development. After 152 and 4 hours exposition cestodes were taken out and fixed with
     2,5% solution of glutaraldehyde for scannind and transmission electron-microscopy study. The
     progressive,dependent of exposition, formation of bulb-like derivates with 10-16 micrometers in
     diameter was showen in scolex.These structures were filled with secret granules, mitochondria
     and vacuoles. In the tegument of D. latum the decrease of thickness of external cytoplasmic
     layer and loss of microtrichia and degeneration of mitochondria were observed. In tegumen- tal
     cells the increasing of secretory and transport activity,the for- mation of many-layer
     concetric structures and changing the structure of mitochondria were seen. In the midlle part
     of the worm's body the erosion of microtrichia and the formation of small bubbles of exter- nal
     cytoplasm of tegument were observed. In the cell layer the swelling of intercellular spaces and
     vacuolisation took place. Formation of secretory vesicles is the usual first reaction of
     parasitic tape worms on the action of anthelmintics (Nelson, 1983).</p>

    <p>Liver Fibrosis - Schistosomicides - Collagen The effects of anti-helminthic therapy on
     schistosomal hepatic fibrosis were studied in a murine model. Mice infected with S. mansoni (50
     cercariae/mouse) were treated at 8 wks post-infection with oxamniquine (60 mg/kg) or
     praziquantel (250 mg/kg); and liver fibrosis was assessed by hydroxyproline measurement and
     histologic examinations at 0,10 and 20 weeks post-treatment. The intensity of infection was
     monitored by liver egg counts. À steady accumulation of collagen was noted in livers of
     infected, untreated mice. At 28 weeks post-infection collagen levels were 15 times higher than
     that found in uninfected controls. Ten weeks after treatment, the level of hydroxyproline in
     the oxamniquine-treated group (11.6 + 1. 2 UM/g) was not significantly different from the level
     in the infected, untreated group (13.2 + O0.9uM/g). There was a significant reduction, however
     in the hydroxyproline level in the praziquantel-treated group (10.2 + 0.9 uM/g - P&lt;0.01). By
     20 weeks post-treatment, liver collagen content in the praziquantel group showed a further
     significant reduction; while the oxamniquine group remained at the same level. Moreover, 10
     weeks after treatment, oxamniquine treated mice showed a lower reduction in liver egg burden
     compared to the prompt decrease that followed praziquantel treatment. These results demonstrate
     that praziquantel treatment lead to earlier stabilization of liver collagen content while a
     longer follow up period may be needed with oxamniquine treatment. (Supported by NMRDC Bethesda,

    <p>Mefloquine Metoclopramide Pharmacokinetics The pharmacokinetics of mefloquine given
     concurrently with metoclopramide was studied in seven healthy Thai volunteers aged between
     24-44 years, weighing 47-60 kg. All were randomised to receive either the coadministration of
     mefloquine (750 mg,orally) and metoclopramide (10 mg, orally) or mefloquine alone (750 mg,
     orally) on the first occasion. Three months later the study was repeated with the alternative
     regimen.</p>
    <p>The main side effects after mefloquine were dizziness, nausea, abdominal pain and diarrhoea.
     The incidence of nausea was less with metoclopramide.</p>
    <p>Three significant changes in meflquine pharmacokinetics were observed when metoclopramide was
     added. These were shorter absorption half-lives (2.35 + 0.75 &amp; 3.23 + 0.55 hr, mean + sd),
     higher maximum concentrations (1570 + 403 &amp; 1196 + 218 ng/ml, mean + sd) and larger AUC
     within 24 hr (1.11 + 0.30 &amp; 0.81 + 0.15 ugs.day/ml), Although metoclopramide increased the
     rate of mefloquine absorption and consequently increased the Cmax, the incidence of toxicity
     was not higher. We therefore recommend that it should be used in conjunction with mefloquine in
     the treatment of falciparum malaria to lessen nausea and vomiting.</p>

    <p>Mefloquine Ampicillin Pharmacokinetics The effect of ampicillin on mefloquine
     pharmacokinetics was studied in eight healthy Thai volunteers aged between 24-51 years,
     weighing 58-61 kg.</p>
    <p>The study was an open randomised cross-over design, in which each subject received either a
     single oral dose of mefloquine 750 mg alone or mefloquine 750 mg together with ampicillin (250
     mg four times daily for five days, started one day prior to mefloquine) and then the
     alternative regimen three months later.</p>
    <p>Side effects on both occasions were similar; the most common vas diarrhoea, After the
     coadministration of mefloquine and ampicillin, maximum concentration of mefloquine (Cmax) was
     increased (Mean+SD of 1648 +509 &amp; 1228 +223 ng/ml); while terminal half-life (T1/2), mean
     residence time (MRT) and volume of distribution at steady state (Vdss/f) were decreased (Mean +
     SD of T1/2 = 14.13 + 3.77 &amp; 16.72 + 2.60 days; Mean + SD of MRT = 19.14 + 4.82 &amp; 25.20
     + 3.57 days; Mean + SD of Vdss/f = 14.09 + 6.60 &amp; 19.40 + 3.03 1/kg).</p>
    <p>These pharmacokinetic parameters are comparable to those obtained from patients with
     falciparum malaria in other studies, We conclude that alteration in gut flora may influence on
     mefloquine excretion, and this mechanism could possibly explain the shorter T1/2 and MRT of
     mefloquine in patients with falciparum malaria. The increase in Cmax could be the result of of
     competition for available tissue binding sites by ampicillin, thus decreasing Vdss/f.</p>

     not yet been established because of the difficult- ies of evaluation of the effect of drugs in
     vitro and in animal model of infection.</p>
    <p>In present moment mebendasole is one of the most promissing drug for the treatment of
     anisakiasis. For ïin vitro test of drug, mebendazole was dissolved ïin medium 199 by the aid of
     1/100 volume of DESMO. A.symplex larvae(3rd stage) were collected from chub mackerel caught in
     coastal waters of Japan. Five worms “ere put in one tube which contained sereal dilution of
     mebendazole in medium 199 and :ñ2 level of D-glucose was was measured by spectrophotometric
     enzyme method day by day. In control tube marked glucose uptake and ecdysis of worms were
     observed after 3 days. But no glucose uptake and ecdysis of worms were noticed in mebendazole
     treated tube even at the level of 5 ppm. This level also reduced the glucose uptake of 4th
     stage larvae by 2/3. Animal model of anisakiasis was established using rat. Rats were slightly
     anesthetized by ether and 10 larvae/rat were inserted mildly into their pharyx and let them
     swallow actively the inserted larvae. Mebendazole was mixed in pellet diet of rat in the levels
     of 100, 400 and 1,600 ppm. and fed them from 2 hours after infection. Rats could not torelate
     1,600 ppm pellets. But they well torelated 400 ppm pellets. In control rats without treatment
     average numbers of wormspenetrated into stomack and intestinal wall were 1.15(12hr),
     1.10(34hr), 1.00(36hr) and 0.58(48hr). Those of 400 ppm pellets fed rats were 1.40(12hr),
     0.70(24hr), O0.00(36hr) and 0.10(48hr). As a rule, 1 to 2 out oof 10 larvae were able to
     penetrate into stomack wall of rat and stay more than 2- 3 days and gradually dropped.
     Mebendazole treatment was supposed to inhibit the glucose uptake of invaded worms and let them
     drop much earlier of 36 hours without ecdysis.</p>

    <p>Trypanosoma Antimalaria Meficquine, a member of the quinolinemethanols is a potent
     antimalaria drug recently introduced into clinical medicine. A study ©f the actions of this
     drug in trypanosomiasis was carried out both in vitro and in vivo on Trypanosoma brucei brucei
     in our laboratory. Blood stream forms of these parasites were grown over mouse kidney cells in
     minimum essential medium {MEM) with various concentrations vf Mefloquine. The drug at
     0.01-0.003 mg ml levels was observed to eliminate completely the parasites in vitro within 24
     hours of its application. Groups of male and female albino mice were treated daily for two,
     three or four days consecutively with Mefloquine at a dose level of 0.03 mg g”! body weight.
     After initial clearance of parasites had been recorded from the blood stream of the animals,
     there was no recrudescence for 3 months and above. The study of Mefloquine as a possible
     trypanocide has shown that the correct dose is given. It is equally found to behave similarly
     in vitro. We, therefore, think the use of Mefloquine may be beneficial for the treatment of
     human trypanosomiasis and this is worth investigating.</p>

    <p>Mots Clés : Leishmania donovani , promastigotes, sinefungin, morphology, ultrastucture.</p>
    <p>Treatment of promastigotes of Leishmania donovani with sublethal concentrations of
     sinefungin, an antiparasitic nucleoside antibiotic, induces biochemical and morphological
     changes. Thymidine incorporation into DNA and some cellular transmethylases are inhibited, the
     synthesis of a set of stress proteins is induced the elongated flagellated promastigotes become
     more and more round-shaped and their mobility decreases. The proportion of immobile
     round-shaped cells depends on the concentration of the antibiotic and on the time of contact.
     Two structural analogues of sinefungin which exhibit antileishmanial effect, triggers also
     similar changes, whereas S-adenosyl-methionine and S-adenosyl-homocysteine, also structurally
     related to sinefungin, are devoid of antiparasitic effect and does not induce morphological
     changes. However when added together with sinefungin, the former acts as an antagonist.</p>
    <p>The ultrastructure of the treated promastigotes was studied by electron microscopy after
     léhrs of exposure to 0.26u4M sinefungin. The main effects are as follows: the flagellar pocket
     (reservoir) is swollen and often filled with electron dense material.</p>
    <p>The flagellum degenerates and the location of the Golgi apparatus is modified. These cells
     are still viable as according to the MIT method. The relationship between the morphological and
     the biochemical changes induced by this antibiotic is under investigation in our laboratory.
     Our hypothesis is that sinefungin by its inhibitor effect on some transmethylases located near
     or in the membrane modifies its fluidity and interfers with the equillibrium between endo and
     exocytosis S9.A 71 P+0O OXAMNIQUINE AND HYCANTHONE ALKYLATE SCHISTOSOME DNA L. Pica-Mattoccia,
     S. Archer, D. Cioli. Institute of Cell Biology, 43 Viale Marx, 00137 Rome, Italy Schistosoma
     mansoni - Oxamniquine - Hycanthone - DNA alkylation We have previously shown that oxamniquine
     (OXA) and hycanthone (HC) have a similar mechanism of action, consisting essentially in an
     irreversible drug-induced inhibition of schistosome nucleic acid synthesis. Drug resistant
     schistosomes were crossed with sensitive worms and resistance was shown to behave as a
     recessive character, suggesting that some schistosome activity is needed for the
     antischistosomal effect to take place. We propose that OXA and HC are enzymatically converted
     into a reactive ester by sensitive schistosomes and that such an ester spontaneously
     dissociates to give rise to an alkylating agent which is capable of alkylating parasite
     macromolecules. The drug esterifying activity should then be absent in resistant (recessive)
     schistosomes which would thus escape alkylation and death.We have collected various pieces of
     evidence supporting our hypothesis: Î- an artificial ester of HC, i.e. HC N-methylcarbamate, is
     active against resistant schistosomes; 2- radioactive HC and radioactive OXA establish
     irreversible (covalent) bonds with the DNA of sensitive schistosomes, whereas the DNA of
     resistant parasites fails to bind the drugs; 3- radioactive HC N-methylcarbamate binds to the
     DNA of sensitive and resistant worms; 4- a rabbit antiserum developed against HC binds to the
     DNA of sensitive schistosomes exposed to HC in vivo, but fails to bind to the DNA of similarly
     exposed resistant worms; 5- the DNA of sensitive schistosomes exposed to radioactive HC was
     isolated, hydrolyzed and analyzed by HPLC: the major peaks of radioactivity coincide with
     samples of HC-deoxyguanosine adducts (made to the N1 and N2 of deoxyguanosine, respectively)
     which were synthesized 1or this purpose and fully characterized. No radioactivity was
     associated with a similarly synthesized HC-thymidine standard.</p>

    <p>La mélarsamine, administrée par voie intra-musculaire profonde [une formulation provisoire du
     produit a été utilisée], à raison de 2 injections de 2,5 mg/kg à 24 heures d'intervalle ou de
     2,2 mg/kg à 3 heures d'intervalle, a montré une efficacité totale : - en essais critiques, chez
     10 chiens sur 14 chiens traités ; - en essais cliniques, chez la totalité des 28 chiens qui ont
     pu être contrôlés 12 semaines après le traitement.</p>
    <p>En outre, les résultats obtenus ont aussi confirmé l'intérêt de définir des classes cliniques
     en fonction de l'état de santé du chien afin d'adapter un protocole thérapeutique adéquat et

    <p>Schistosoma mansoni - vaccine - immunity - Praziquantel - damage Mice vaccinated 4 weeks
     previously with radiation-attenuated cercariae of Schistosoma mansoni express high levels of

     challenge parasites are killed predominantly in the skin. When vaccinated/challenged mice are
     treated with Praziquantel (Pzq) on day 6 post-challenge, however, parasite are also killed in
     the lungs. Indeed, a highly significant interaction can be detected between the two treatment
     regimens. Histological studies have revealed that many parasites traversing the lung
     vasculature of drug-treated väccinated mice, but not untreated vaccinated mice, become trapped
     within inflammatory reactions and show evidence of damage. These foci comprise mainly
     mononuclear cells with some granulocytes. Monoclonal antibodies directed against cell surface
     markers are being used to characterize these cell types further. Parasites within pulmonary
     reactions show varying manifestations of damage including loss of tegument, increase in nuclear
     density and constriction points along the length. Electron microscopy has been used to clarify
     and extend light microscopy observations on the nature of the host- parasite interaction in
     mice receiving the dual treatment regimen. Comparative data on mechanisms of worm elimination
     in mice subjected to either treatment alone will also be presented.</p>

    <p>112 onchocerquiens Ecuatoriens (Esmeraldas) et 200 onchocerquiens de Guatemala furent
     traité(e)s avec l'’amocarzine (CGP 6140) à bas dosage (3 mg/kg) deux fois par jour pendant 3
     jours par prise orale postprandiale. La résorption d’amocarzine chez 20 malades randomisés fut
     homogène et prévisible. Ces résultats furent confirmés pour 48 autres malades. La tolérance
     clinique pour deux races (indios/noirs) des deux sexes (homes adultes, femmes adultes
     non-enceintes) fut “acceptable à bonne". Les valeurs hémato-biochimiques sont restées en
     moyenne dans les normes. La réduction des micro- filaires dans la peau fut en moyenne de
     l’ordre de 90 % dans la première semaine suivant le traitement et persiste jusqu’au sixème mois
     :(- temps de soumission du résumé). L’effet microfilaricide au niveau oculaire est plus lent,
     il y a eu bonne tolérance ophthalmologique. Les résultats préliminaires montrent un effet
     partiel sur les vers adultes, car 25% des vers adultes furent jugés vivants lors de la nodulec-
     tomie qui eut lieu à 4 mois. L'analyse portant sur tous les nodules prélevés ainsi que sur
     l'effet microfilaricide sur un an sera présentée au congrès.</p>
    <p>En conclusion: Amocarzine (CGP 6140) est un nouveau onchocerquicide à action pro- longée.

    <p>Indications for use include treatment of liver damage and prevention of Malaria.</p>
    <p>The antimalarial activity of the extracts was tested in vitro against Plasmodium falciparum
     and Plasmodium berghei. Addition of 50 ng/ml to cultures of Pl, falciparum caused a total
     inhibition of parasite growth. In the case of Pl, berghei the effect was determined by means of
     DNA synthesis measurements in parasite-infected erythrocytes. At concentrations of 50 ug/ml we
     have found a drastic reduction of [FH] hypoxanthine incorporation.</p>
    <p>Preliminary studies äin Pl, berghei-infected mice showed also a therapeutic effect of the
     plant extract.</p>
    <p>To elucidate the mode of action we compared the inhibition of DNA and protein synthesis of
     Pl, berghei-infected erythrocytes. Since protein synthesis was later affected than DNA
     synthesis, which stopped rather immediately, DNA synthesis is assumed to be the target. This is
     in agreement with data obtained from tests with different purified DNA polymerases.</p>
    <p>In further experiments the effect of combinations of the plant extract with introduced drugs
     will be determined.</p>

    <p>Filarial infections, Mastomys, ivermectin, efficacy With the successful results in the
     treatment of onchocerciasis, ivermectin (Iv) is being evaluated for its efficacy against the
     other filarial infections. Few recent studies indicate its promise in the treatment of
     bancroftian filariasis. In the present study, the effect of Iv is evaluated against 4 filarial
     species viz., Brugia malayi, B. pahangi, Acanthocheilonema viteae and Litomosoides carinii in
     the multimammate rat Mastomys natalensis. The animals with circulating microfilariae (mf)
     induced by vector-mediated infection with L3 or by transfusion of mf were used in the study. À
     single dose of Iv (100 mcg/kg) given subcutaneously to Mastomys infected with L. carinii or A.
     viteae eliminated the circulating mf within 2 hrs., while no such effect was seen on
     Brugia-infected animals. In contrast, Iv had dramatic effect on all the 4 species of mf when
     they were introduced into the host by intravenous infusion.</p>
    <p>Iv had no effect on the mf of L. carinii and of B. pahangi when the parasites were given
     intraperitoneally into Mastomys. However, Iv exerted cell-mediated cytotoxic effect on mf of B.
     malayi when similarly introduced into the animals. Current evidence suggests that Iv affects
     the mf both by a process of complement activation and by acting synergistically with the immune
     antibody of the host. Iv had adulticidal activitv on A. viteae and. to a much less extent on L.
     carinii.</p>

     Current therapy of amoebiasis requires use of multiple agents effective at different body
     sites.</p>
    <p>Azithromycin, an extended half-life macrolide, exhibits in vitro amoebicidal activity at z 20
     ug/ml. We determined serum and tissue levels of azithromycin and its efficacy in the treatment
     of experimental amoebic liver abscess (ALA) in the gerbil (Meriones unguiculatus). ALA
     formation was evaluated 14 days after intrahepatic innoculation with 5 x 105 cloned axenic
     Entamoeba histolytica trophozoites (strain HMI:IMSS). Twenty-four hours following a 100 mg/kg
     dose of azithromycin, average drug levels in nine gerbils were 34.0 ug/g in liver and 24.7 ug/g
     in caecal tissue. Serum azithromycin levels after the oral dose were 3.0 ug/ml, 1.1 #g/ml, 1.22
     ug/ml and 1.05 ug/ml at 2, 6, 8 and 24 hours, respectively. ALA occurred in 78.1% of control
     gerbils (n=32), in 27.3% of gerbils who received 100 mg/kg azithromycin 3 hours prior to
     amoebic challenge (n=11) and in 50% and 78% of gerbils who were given azithromycin (100 mg/kg)
     on days 7-10 or days 7-14 post intrahepatic challenge (n=8 for each). In comparison,
     prophylaxis with 100 mg/kg metronidazole (n=7) or treatment on days 7-14 post challenge (n-6)
     resulted in no ALA being present on day 14. Azithromycin holds promise for future use in the
     treatment of amoebiasis. However, equal doses of metronidazole were more effective in
     experimental ALA.</p>

    <p>Cryptosporidial infection, although a self-limiting diarrhoeal disease in normal individuals,
     poses a serious threat to the health of immunocompromised hosts. Unfortunately, there is not an
     effective treatment for this protozoan infection. Using a dexamethasone-immunosuppressed rat
     model, the macrolide compound azithromycin was evaluated for anticryptosporidial activity. The
     drug completely revented the infection when administered orally for 9-11 days either in the
     feed or once daily by gavage.</p>
    <p>e anticryptosporidial activity of azithromycin was dose-related, 200 mg/kg/day being the
     minimum dose that completely prevented infection. Apart from its efficiency as a prophylactic
     agent, azithromycin eliminated established infections in immunosuppressed rats, suggesting a
     therapeutic potential as well.</p>
    <p>There was no evidence of severe drug-related toxicity in any of the animals. Withdrawal of
     the compound after 9-11 days of treatment was associated with recurrence of infection in
     immunosuppressed animals. This suggests that azithromycin therapy of several weeks duration may
     be necessary in the immunocompromised host. In conclusion, azithromycin has both prophylactic
     and therapeutic activity against Cryptosporidium and warrants further investigation as an
     anticryptosporidial agent.</p>

     Einstein. Merck Sharp and Dohme Research Laboratories, P.0. Box 2000, Rahway, New Jersey USA
     lvermectin Receptor - Caenorhabditis elegans Ivermectin, a chemically modified macrocyclic
     lactone derived as a fermentation product from Streptomyces avermitilis, is currently the
     nematocidal drug of choice due to its high potency with lack of toxicity. Isolation of the
     nematode receptor for ivermectin would be advantageous from the point of view of understanding
     mechanism of action of the drug. The putative ivermectin receptor from the free living
     nematode, Caenorhabditis elegans, has been solublized from membranes with Triton X-100 and
     partially purified by ion exchange chromatography on a DEAE-5PW HPLC column. This partially
     purified preparation retains high affinity ivermectin binding activity and displays a K4 for
     ivermectin of approximatly 0.1nM. A stable “H-ivermectin labeled receptor complex has been
     generated by incubating the Triton X-190 soluble C. elegans proteins with 7H-ivermectin
     followed by treatment of the mixture with activated charcoal to remove free ivermectin. The
     ivermectin receptor complex generated in this way is stable to freeze thawing, ammonium sulfate
     precepitation, and can be recovered as the intact complex after running over ion exchange and
     gel filtration columns. A DEAE purified batch of the C. elegans ivermectin receptor complex yas
     used to immunize mice.</p>
    <p>All of the mice immunized, produced antibody recognizing the “H-ivermectin receptor.</p>
    <p>Monoclonal antibodies are being prepared from those mice. A monoclonal antibody directed
     against the C. elegans ivermectin receptor complex will be useful for the purification to
     homogeneity and further characterization of the nematode receptor.</p>

    <p>Sheep, fasciola, rafoxanid, cholinesterase Cholinesterase by histochemical method the
     mechanism of fasciolo- cyde action of 3‘-chlor-4' parachlorpenoxy - 3,5 dyiodesalicylanilyd
     known as rafoxanid and disalan were tested. The preparation in the dose of 10 mg/kg was given
     per os to the naturally invased sheep ready to be gsacrificed in 18 hours. The decrease of
     moving activity and appearence of dark colour in caudal and marginal parts of the fasciol body
     were observed. It was established that the salicylanilyd completely sellec- tively suppresses
     muscular farincs tissue cholinesterase actively blocking swollowing and extracting fasciola
     function which results in ceasing of further swollowing of preparation. This mechanism peculie-
     rity of rafoxanide disalan action should be taken into consideration while using in
     combinations with other anthelmintics in fasciolosis.</p>

    <p>Azithromycin, Pneumocystis, Culture Model.</p>
    <p>Azithromycin, a macrolide with a 15-member ring, is known to achieve high levels in lung
     tissue and has been shown to have activity against Mycobacterium avium-intracellulare and
     Toxoplasma gondiü. The anti-Pneumocystis activity was investigated in a culture system in which
     Pneumocystis from rats is cultured with WI-38 human embryonic lung fibroblast monolayers.
     Azithromycin at 1 ug/ml showed partial inhibition of Pneumocystis growth and at 10 ug/ml showed
     complete inhibition. Erythromycin, another macrolide, has not shown activity against
     Pneumocystis in culture or animal models. It has been shown previously that a 50 mg/ ÉE dose of
     azithromycin is well tolerated and provides a peak level in lung tissue of 18 ug/g with a
     half-life of 16 hours. Further investigation of azithromycin in the rat model is in
     progress.</p>

     Benzothiazoles - Acanthocheilonema viteae - Onchocerca gibsoni Antifilarial effects of
     benzazoles against microfilariae, developing lar- vae and adult macrofilariae in the
     multimammate rat were reported earlier Here we describe the effects of four selected
     benzothiazoles (CGP 20309, 21833, 24589 and 26702) in two phylogenetically more relevant
     host-para- site systems, the Mongolian jird (M. unquiculatus) infected with Acantho- cheilonema
     viteae and in cattle infected with Onchocerca qibsoni.</p>
    <p>In the jird, all four compounds were orally more macro- than microfilari- cidal against A.
     viteae. Data indicate that CGP 20309 and CGP 21833 are slow-acting macrofilaricides. All adult
     worms were killed by day 38 fol- lowing treatment with 25 mg/kg daily x5, whereas 50 mg/kg
     daily x5 was necessary to produce the same effect by day 32.</p>
    <p>In cattle, macrofilaricidal effects against O. qibsoni 90 days after a single oral dose of 40
     mg/kg were assessed by histological examination of male and female worms in sections of
     nodules, and with embryograms. Most female worms had no embryos in the early stages of
     development in their uteri and all embryonic stages were significantly reduced in numbers com-
     pared with those of worms from control cattle.</p>
    <p>Degenerative changes, especially of the hypodermis and musculature, were observed
     histologically in all male and female O. qibsoni from treated cattle. In most males the whole
     body had disintegrated whereas the body of females remained relatively intact. It appeared
     that, in females, the anterior end disintegrated first allowing leakage of microfilariae from
     the disrupted vagina and proximal uterus into the nodular tissue.</p>

     Pharmacokinetics, CGA 157419, acarine growth regulator The preliminary pharmacokinetic profiles
     of CGA 157419, à new benzoylphenyl urea acarine growth regulator, have been examined in trials
     carried out on cattle in Australia. The compound can be quantified, by HPLC techniques, in the
     whole blood and plasma of cattle which have received a treatment either by a topical spray or
     orally. Studies undertaken on cattle infested with Boophilus microplus ticks show that a level
     near 10ug/L of com- pound in the blood/plasma Ts required for the ticks parasitizing the
     treated animals to have their development affected. Blood profiles of the compound in cattle
     treated with a number of candidate pour-on formulations were found to be highly variable, both
     in terms of the general shape of the profile and also in the area under the profile curve.</p>
    <p>Following treatment with a number of formulations designed for sub-cutaneous administra-
     tion, plasma profiles have: been constructed. The differing shapes and areas under these
     profiles have been used to account for differences in the efficacy that is achieved by the
     treatments with the injectable formulations. One formulation produces a plasma profile of the
     compound which correlates well with a good initial curative effect and which is capable of
     inhibiting the tick development cycle for 3 months.</p>

    <p>Praziquantel was administred only one day to pigs with cysticercosis at 100, 50 or 25 mg/Kg.
     Several hematological parameters and anti-cysticercus antibodies were analyzed in different
     days. At day 34 after treatment all pigs were humanely necropsied and detailed macroscopic and
     histopathological studies were performed.Anti- cysticercus antibodies incressed after treatment
     as analyzed by enzymed linked immunosorbent assay (EIA) and several glicoprotein T. solium
     specific bands were seen in electroimmunotransferblot (EITB), while hematological results
     showed leucocytosis.</p>
    <p>A clear macroscopic degeneration of parasites was seen in the treated pigs as compared to the
     non treated group. Histological analysis also showed degeneration of cysticerci and increase in
     the inflammatory response, in parasites obtained from muscles and brains. Nevertheless no
     complete dissapearence of cysticerci was attained, suggesting that longer times of host
     survival after cestocidal drug treatment are needed in order to cure the infection.</p>

     peregra ovata Müller, secondary intermediate host of Fasciola hepatica, and against associated
     fauna and flora. Relationships between the compounds toxicity and their physico- chemical

     time. A multiple linear regression was employed according to the toxicity values as explained
     variable and the physico-chemical parameters as explanatory variables.The lipophilicity
     appeared as the main parameter of toxicity. Nevertheless, the other ones took a prominent part
     in the molluscicidal activity ; particularly, the compounds unstability was a restricting
     factor of toxicity. The quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) used in this study
     was necessary to explore original products. So, it was possible to evaluate the molluscicidal
     activity of new compounds and the aquatic pollution possibility.</p>

     They had made the comparison between toxicological data against associated fauna and flora on
     the one hand, and against the snail (Lymnaea peregra ovata) on the other. General data had
     shown that the snail was more susceptible to toxic compounds than the two other species. The
     active concentration to inhibit E. gracilis in vitro growth were much more important than
     molluscicidal concentrations. So, the BNT derivatives had shown a low acute toxicity on the
     associated flora and then can protect the environmental medium.</p>

     Ivermectin, human hookworm, Ancylostoma duodenale Fifteen puppys were each inoculated (subc.)
     5600 infective larvae of Ancylostoma duodenale. The larvae were cultivated from human hookworm
     ova isolated from feces of Ancylostomiasis patients. The infected pups were given 30 mg/kg/pup
     cortisone acetate (im), 2 times /week for 4 weeks. 30 days after the infection, the pups were
     given single oral doses of ivermectin at 10, 5, 3, 2 or O ug/kg/pup (3 pups for the first three
     and 4 and 2 respectively for the last two dosages). At 10, 5, or 3 ug/kg, 2/3 of the pups was
     completely cleared of their infection so that many worms were passed in the feces on day 1-3,
     but no worm was recovered from the intestine at necropsy on day 4 after treatment. Only in rare
     instances were ivermectin's effect partial or nusatisfactory. 2 ug/kg was ineffective. In a
     paralell series, 3 dogs with A. caninum infection were given single oral doses of ivermectin at
     5, 3, or O ug/kg/dog. The former two dosages completely cleared the A. caninum infection of the
     dogs. The blank controls (0 ug/kg) of both A. duodenale and À. caninum series gave negative
     results. Ivermectin are, therefore, hoghly effective against both A. duodenale and À. caninum.
     Ivermectin was much less effective against Necator americanus, it took 20 ug/kg to completely
     or partially eliminate the infection in laboratory adapted N. americanus infection in hamsters.
     However, in vitro experiments demonstrated that ivermectin was lethal to eggs as well as to
     infective (13) larvae of both A. duodenale and N. americanus at a concentration of 10
     ug/m1.</p>

    <p>Hymenolepsis microstoma - H. diminuta- Cyclosporin A - Chemotherapy The effects of the
     immunomodulatory/anti-parasitic drug, cyclosporin A (CsA) on Hymenolepis microstoma and H.
     diminuta in mice have been investigated by measuring worm recovery, weight, location and
     fecundity in drug-treated mice. Scanning and transmission electron microscopy were used to
     study concomitant damage to worm surfaces.</p>
    <p>CsA was significantly anatagonistic to H. microstoma, reducing worm weight, delaying
     migration, suppressing egg production and lowering parasite survival. Furthermore, in vivo CsA
     caused gross and ultrastructural changes to the worm surface. In marked contrast, CsA delayed
     the normal host-mediated expulsion of H. diminuta from CBA, MF1 and Balb/C mice, enabling the
     parasite to reach patency. Worm recovery and weight both increased with CsA treatment, but no
     gross surface damage occurred. Thus CsA acts in opposing ways on these lumen-dwelling cestodes.
     These paradoxical drug effects reflect the putative antagonism between immunosuppression and
     anthelmintic activity.</p>
    <p>In H. microstoma, where CsA-induced surface damage implies direct mode of drug action, the
     anti-parasitic properties of CsA dominate; but with H. diminuta in mice, immunosuppression
     dominates. Furthermore, the ability of CsA, with its discrimatory action on T-cells, to
     suppress host-mediated expulsion of H. diminuta from mice, may implicate the importance of
     T-cells in protective immunity to this parasite.</p>

    <p>Maximal concentrations of plasma quinine were 3.77 + 1.80 ug/ml and 2.91 + 0.64 ug/ml (mean +
     SD), half-life of absorption (T1/2 ab) were 19.77 + 11.03 min and 31.16 + 14.99 min, time to
     maximal concentrations (Tmax) were 87.81 + 33.95 and 134.57 + 42,07 min and area under the
     curve (AUCo-8 hr) were 1316.64 + 560.93 and 1126.87 + 275.31 ug.hr/nml for quinine given
     concurrently with metocloepramide and quinine alone, respectively. Electrocardiogram monitoring
     showed no significant changes in QTc in both occasions. No volunteers developed hypotension
     during the study period.</p>
    <p>In conclusion, the use of metoclopramide with quinine did not increase the side-effects
     despite higher plasma quinine concentration during the first 8 br. Furthermore, it reduced the
     symptoms of nausea and vomiting which are frequently seen in patients with malaria. We
     therefore, recommend that it be used in corporate with quinine in the treatment of malaria.</p>

     carinii, Aculeacin A, yeast glucan We have reported that the cyst wall of Pneumocystis carinii
     preincubated with Zymolyase ( $-1,3-glucan laminaripentaohydrolase) was no longer staiïned by
     Gomori's methenamine silver and ultrastructually lacked the outer two layers, leaving only a
     plasma membrane. These observations indicated a major component of the cyst wall was
     8-1,3-glucan. Aculeacin A(Toyo Jozo Co., Ltd., Tokyo), which is an antibiotic produced by a
     strain of Aspergillus aculeatus, has been shown to inhibit in vitro 8-1,3 glucan synthesis of
     fungal cell wall. The present study was undertaken to evaluate in vivo effects of Aculeacin À
     on formation of P. carinii cysts. Wistar rats weighing about 250g received prednisolone acetate
     twice a week (5mg per rat) subcutaneously and tetratycline (1,000mg/liter) in their drinking
     water throughout the experiment. Intraperitoneal administrations of Aculeacin À at several
     doses were initiated at the sixth week of steroid treatment and continued until death twice a
     week. Treatment with Aculeacin À at a dose of 12.5mg per rat showed prominent inhibitory
     effects on formation of P. carinii cysts. When treatments with Aculeacin A were initiated at
     the same time as the initiation of steroid treatment, even at 2.5mg per rat, the reduction of
     the number of the cysts of P. carinii was observed. These results confirmed our previous
     finding that f-1,3-glucan is a major and pivotal component of the cyst wall of P. carinii.
     Furthermore, our results might indicate a strategy to discover new type of therapeutic agents
     for Pneumocystis pneumonia.</p>

     Cochlospermum angolense - in vitre - mode of action Aqueous extracts of the roots of
     Cochlospermum angolense are widely used in the traditional medicine against icteric diseases
     and for prophylaxis of malaria in Angola. The current study shows that the drug is also
     effective against filarial parasites in vitro. Adult filariae (Litomo- soides carinii) were
     exposed to an alcoholic extract. Their motility was affected in a dose and time dependent
     manner by 10 pg/ml and higher concentrations. 100 pg/ml immobilized the worms within 2 h. Short
     term exposure (0.5-4 h) subsequently followed by incubation in drug- free medium had persisting
     effects on the motility of the worms and reduced the release of microfilariae. The parasites
     incorporated the drug. Initial mode of action studies have been performed. After 3 h exposure
     to 100 pg/ml there was a dramatic decrease in the excretion of both lactate and acetate. No
     effect was seen on mitochondrial respiration, respiration of the intact worms, glycolysis or a
     number of enzymes in the primary energy generating path- ways of L. carinii. However, compared
     to a number of other antifilarials, there was a large decrease in the short term uptake of
     glucose. Whether or not this is a direct effect of the drug on glucose transporter remains to
     be determined.</p>

     [Ir(IV)Cls]H2-Pentamidine (1.5 ng/ml), [Ir(IV)Cls]H2-Ro15-0216 (10 ug/ml),
     [(PtBr)e]H2-Metamidium (30 ug/ml), [Pt(IV)Bre]H2-Benznidazole (20 ug/ml),
     [Pt(IV)Bre]H2-Ro15-0216 (50 ug/ml), cis-Pt(II)-Pentamidine (0.1 pg/ml, only partially
     solubilized), Rh(I)-COD-Pentamicine (5 - 10 ng/ml), Rh(I)-COD-Benznidazole (10 ug/ml),
     Rh(III)-Ethylxanthate (30 ug/ml) and Pt(Il)-Pentamidine-cis-Pt (II) (Pentamidine) (Cl)2 (2
     ng/ml). The four Pentamidine complexes were the most active and showed sensiti- vities
     comparable to pure Pentamidine with an ICso of 0.5 to 1 ng/ml. The ten to twenty fold lower
     toxicity of the Ir- and Pt-Pentamidine complexes of 400 to 1000 mg/kg as compared to pure
     Pentamidine with 50 mg/kg makes them promising candidates for therapeutic trypanocidal
     drugs.</p>

    <p>CONTRASTING EFFECTS OF VITAMIN E AND PABA DEPRIVATION:P.BERGHEI VS P.VINCKEI Malaria, Vitamin
     E, PABA, Nutrition, Antioxidant.</p>
    <p>À host diet deficient in vitamin E(VE) but supplemented with paraaminobenzoic acid (PABA)
     impedes the growth of P.berqghei in mice but not P.vinckei, whereas a diet deficient in PABA
     and supplemented with VE reduces the growth of both species.Three week old CD-1 mice were fed a
     standard casein based diet with a fat source consisting of 4% menhaden fish oil and 1% corn oil
     for 4 weeks prior to inoculation with 5X10* parasites.The diets contained combinations of
     either O or 100 mg/kg of VE and O or 20 mg/kg PABA.The antimalarial activity of the diets was
     determined by monitoring survival for 60 days after infection.The results are summarized below
     with the number of mice surviving 60 days over the total mice per group.</p>
    <p>0 E 100 E O0 E 100 E Parasite 20 PABA 20 PABA O PABA O PABA P.berghei 10/10 0/10 10/10 9/10
     P.vinckei 0/10 0/10 8/10 7/10 Possible explanations for this difference in susceptibility to a
     VE deficient diet include:1) P.vinckei parasites may concentrate exogenous VE more than
     P.bergqhei.2) P.vinckei exerts a lower oxidant stress on the host than P.berghei.These results
     point out a profound difference in the oxidative metabolism in these 2 plasmodial
     species.Dietary manipulation of the antioxidant VE status and/or PABA level of the host without
     drug intervention merits further consideration as a possible nutritional method of controlling
     malaria.</p>

    <p>Benzimidazoles - Anguilla anguilla - Pseudodactylogyrus - Monogerea The efficacies of nine
     different benzimidazoles were tested (water bath treatments) on small pigmented eels (Anguilla

     (Monogenea).</p>
    <p>Exposure time was 24 hours and eels were examined 4-5 days post treatment.</p>
    <p>Mebendazole (1 mg/l) eradicated all parasites and is considered as the most potent drug,
     whereas luxabendazole and albendazole only were 100 per cent effective in.a concentration of 10
     mg/1. Flubendazole, fenbendazole and oxibendazole (10 mg/1) caused a reduction of the infection
     level to a larger extent than triclabendazole and parbendazole. Thiabendazole even in a
     concentration as high as 100 mg/1 was without effect on Pseudodacty- logyrus spp.</p>

    <p>THE EFFECT OF CYCLOSPORIN À ON THE COURSE OF INFECTION BY TRICHINELLA PSEUDOSPIRALIS OR

     Intestinal nematodes, Cyclosporin À, anti-parasite action The effect of Cyclosporin À /Cs-A/, a
     metabolite of the fungi Cylindro- carpum lucidum Booth and Trichoderma polysporum Rifai, on the
     course of infection by Trichinella pseudospiralis and Nematospiroides dubius on C3H strain of
     mice was examined in vivo. Cs-A was found to affect both host and the parasites themselves. In
     infected mice treated with Cs-A far weaker stimulation in the lymphatic organs was observed,
     this being par- ticularly distinct in the thymus, mesenteric lymph nodes and in periphe- ral
     blood on days immediately subsequent to administration of this com- pound. It was only in the
     spleen that inhibition of cell proliferation was not observed, in fact the reverse, intense
     stimulation was found. The direct effect of Cs-A on T. pseudospiralis was manifested in the
     marked reduction in numbers of adult forms in the small intestine, inhibition of the females’”
     reproductive functions and considerable elimination of new- born and migrating forms of T.
     pseudospiralis. Cs-A had no effect on the numbers of adult worms of N. dubius in the small
     intestine, but greatly reduced the fecundity of the female nematodes, as shown by the number of
     eggs found per 1 g fresh faeces as early as the next day after adminis- tering Cs-A /
     subcutaneuosly /, then on consecutive days, i.e. 16 to 36 DAI was maintained on a level over
     three times lower than that for mice infected only N. dubius /control group/. On 44 DAI this
     value returned to the level of the control group of mice.</p>

    <p>Hydatidosis, ‘in vitro'"', treatment, anthelmintics.</p>
    <p>The need to find new active substances against the larval stage of E. granulosus is self
     evident, because up to date no effective chemotherapy for hydatid disease is available.</p>
    <p>Accordingly the development of "in vitro'"' methods for a rapid screening of drugs is
     desirable. By that reason we have developed two experimental models for drugs screening.</p>
    <p>The firts model is based on E. granulosus protoscoleces, wehereas the second one needs of "in
     vitro developed cysts. The aim of using two different biological materials is to obtain data
     for treatment of secondary and primary hidatidosis, respectively.</p>
    <p>Praziquantel, levamisole, ivermectin, oxfendazole, mebendazole and albendazole dissolved in
     DMSO (1%3, were added to 199 medium containing protoscoleces. The concentrations used were 50,
     10, 1 and 0,1 xg/ml. Praziquantel and ivermectin proved to be the fastest-acting drugs, causing
     rostellar disorganization after 1h. and 16h. of exposure, respectively.</p>
    <p>The remaining drugs showed a marked and irreversible tissue vacuolation. Such process finally
     leads to protoscolex death.</p>
    <p>In the second experimental model cysts were developed from protoscoleces by culturing them
     for 40 days in 199 medium supplemented with foetal calf serum. These cysts were incubated for
     15 days with albendazole (50, 10, 1 and 0,1 yug/ml, dissolved as above).</p>
    <p>After "in vitro" treatment, cyst germinal membrane was partially retracted and showed a
     marked cellular disorganization. To asses the viability of these cysts, they were passaged into
     mice.</p>

    <p>Giardia intestinalis, Modèle animal, Malnutrition, Azote La physiopathologie de la giardiose
     reste mal comprise ; aussi, avec un modèle G. intestinalis - souriceau swiss NMRI, nous avons
     étudié plusieurs aspects des relations hôte-parasite. 1) Susceptibilité de souriceaux infestés
     à l'âge de 5 j., à deux souches de Giardia d'origine humaine (Paris/86/LCF/6 et Paris/88/LCF/8)
     : deux _ profils différents de colonisation sont observés avec 22,5 + 3,4 x 106 (n = 6) et 5,2
     + 2,0 x 10 (n = 6) trophozoïtes par souriceau (T/S) à l'acmé de l'infestation (10eme jour), la
     durée maximale de l'infestation étant de 21 et de 14 j., respectivement. 2) Influence de la
     différenciation entérocytaire de la naissance au sevrage du souriceau : on observe un
     raccourcissement de l'infestation de 21 à 7 j. pour des souriceaux infestés respectivement à 5
     et 21 j. 3) Retentissement de la présence de Giardia sur le métabolisme azoté : on
     constate,.par rapport aux témoins, une augmentation (p &lt; 0,05 du 7eme au l4eme j. de
     l'élimination fécale et une diminution (p &lt; 0,05) de la teneur en azote de la muqueuse
     jéjunale aux 17eme et 25eme j. 4) Conséquences d'une malnutrition provoquée : on note une
     moindre multiplication des trophozoïtes avec des valeurs optimales de 3,3 + 2,4 x 108 T/S (n =
     7) alors qu'elles sont de 19,7 + 5,7 x 106 T/s (n = 6) pour le groupe témoin. Ces résultats
     témoignent des rôles respectifs joués par Giardia, spécificité et effet cytopathogène local, et
     par l'environnement entérocytaire du souriceau, sevrage et état nutritionnel.</p>

     Cruz, Av.Brasil 4365 - Cep 21045 Rio de Janeiro - Brazil We developed a system for the trial of
     drugs against Trypanosoma ceruzi analysing two parameters: (a) the direct upon the vertebrate
     stages of the parasite through assays of proliferation/lysis, incorporation of radiactive
     precursors and ultrastructural alter- ations; (b) the effect upon host cell-T. cruzi
     interaction. This model was tested with nifurtimox (Nif) and benznidazol (Bz), showing the
     potent effect of these drugs used in clinics against Chagas' disease, whereas allopurinol
     presented no important effect. Mega- zol-a thiadiazole derivative - showed potency similar to
     Nif and Bz, and led to 91% inhi- vition of (3H) - leucine incorporation by amastigotes, whereas
     Nif and Bz and 20% respc- Tively suggesting a selective activity of megazol upon protein
     synthesis.</p>
    <p>This system was also employed to test polienic antibiotics and calcium antagonists, causing
     both classes of drug lysis of trypomastigotes and inhibition of the proliferation of
     amastigotes in axenic medium. Amphotericin B (AmB) and filipin led to ultrastructural
     alterations at the membrane probably due to their known biding to sterols. AmB in range of 2.5
     - 7.5 uM destroyed amastigotes inside marcrophages and heart muscle cells. (HMC).</p>
    <p>Phenothiazines and verapamil' were also tested: (a) chlorpromazine (CP) ‘and triflu-
     promazine (TF) destroyed intracellular amastigotes in microphages at 12.5 uM and in HMG at
     50-75 uM. Autophagic vacuoles containing lammelar material were characteristic, and could be
     due to intralysosomal acumulation of polar lipids; (b) verapamil at the range of 50-150 uM
     destroys the vertebrate forms of T. cruzi both extra- or intracellularly in microphages or HMC.
     As agents that alters Ca2+ metabolism may exert different pharmaco- logical effects "in vitro!"
     and "in vivo" further work on the levels of Ca2+ and animal experimentation are needed to
     investigate these drugs.</p>
    <p>This system proved to be very suitable for the analysis of new drugs upon the verte- brate
     forms of T.cruzi (instead of using epimastigotes) and primary heart cell culture (one of target
     cell preferentially infeéted "in vivo") are employed.</p>

    <p>Pneumocystis carinii, pentamidine, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, explant cultures,
     ultrastructure The activity of pentamidine and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole has been tested in
     explant cultures of mouse and rabbit lung parasitized with P. carinii and in vivo in rat and
     mouse models. The effects of the anti-Pneumocystis drugs have been ultrastructurally and
     quantitatively evaluated. The ultrastructural evaluation provided informations on the fine
     morphology of PF. carinii under the influence of drugs, on the sensitivity of the different
     life cycle parasite stages to drugs, on the mechanism of action of drugs and on its effects on
     the ultrastructure of the lung tissue. The results of the in vivo experiments were consistent
     with the in vitro observations. Parasite counts and evaluation of the percent distribution of
     different stages were performed. Electron microscopy, that provides information on the
     morphological integrity of the parasite, could be useful to study the P. carinii organisms
     frequently observed in BAL, after treatment, in AIDS patients. Combination of in vitro and in
     vivo experiments controlled by light and electronic microscopy resulted in a relevant system to
     assess the activity of drugs.</p>

    <p>L'obtention d'une filariose expérimentale chez la souris blanche est fondamentale pour faire
     progresser les études en pathologie humaine. Depuis une dizaine d'années, les efforts pour
     réaliser de tels modèles ont abouti à des résultats intéressants avec les Brugia mais cela
     nécessite divers artifices (souris athymiques, souris sans cellule T, inoculation
     intrapéritonéale des L3 à des souriceaux nouveaux nés). L'espèce proposée ici est Litomosoides
     galizai Bain, Petit et Diagne, 1989. C'est une nouvelle filaire, parasite d'un Cricetidae
     sud-américain. Elle est transmise cycliquement à la souris blanche, et au mérion depuis déjà 7
     générations. L'infestation des rongeurs se fait par inoculation sous cutanée des larves
     infestantes qui se sont développées chez l'acarien Bdellonyssus bacoti. Tous les mérions
     infestés avec 50 L3 sont positifs avec une forte microfilarémie. Chez les souris sans
     traitement infestées avec 25 L3, 70% des Swiss et 100% des BALB/c sont positives, 10% des
     souris Swiss et 50% des BALB/c ont une microfilarémie patente et ce pourcentage s'élève
     nettement sous l'action de la cortisone. La cyclophosphamide est sans effet. Il n'a été
     constaté ni adaptation ni perte de virulence au cours des transmissions successives. La
     capacité de L. galizai d'effectuer son développement complet chez la souris en fait un modèle
     très favorable aux recherches en génétique, immunologie et chimiothérapie des fiarioses.</p>

    <p>Brugia pahangi, lymphatic filariasis, canine filaricide model Basic parasitological data was
     collected from control and treated dogs to define the utility of induced lymphatic infections
     of B. pahangi in beagles as a model for screening anti-filarial drugs. Ten compounds were
     evaluated in 3 tiers using a total of 108 dogs given 200 infective L; of B. pahangi in the
     dorsum of the right hind paw. Of these 108 dogs, 88 were selected for use based on
     microfilarial history. Treatment was started 4 months postinoculation (PI) with dogs treated at
     1) 50 mg/kg or 0.5 mg/kg (ivermectin only) divided BID x 5 days OR in Tier I, 2) 100 mg/kg
     divided BID x 5 OR in Tier II, and 3) 50 mg/kg x 3 SC in Tier III. Microfilarial patterns in
     the control dogs of the 3 tiers varied, with lower counts during cooler weather and higher
     counts in warmer weather, but the counts gradually increased until necropsy, which was at 6
     months PI. The live worms recovered at necropsy from the control dogs averaged 36.1 (range,
     17-69), 20.5 (range, 5-43), and 35.8 (range, 19-71) worms for Tiers I (8 dogs) 11 (4 dogs), and
     III (4 dogs), respectively. Most (96.3%) of these worms were recovered from the lymphatics of
     the right hind limb, the right inguinal lymph node, and the abdominal lymph nodes. Of the 10
     compounds tested, ivermectin (Tier I) and the benzimidazole carbamates, UMF-078 (Tier III) and
     its hydrochloride salt, UMF-289 (Tier 11), and UMF-173 (Tier III) were active against
     microfilariae. Flubendazole (Tier III), UMF-078 (Tier III), UMF-173 (Tier III), and UMF-058
     (Tier III) were active against the adults. Oral doses of albendazole (Tier II) and flubendazole
     (Tier I) were inactive against microfilariae and adults. Data suggest that some of these
     compounds are slow acting and that a longer holding period would be needed to determine true
     efficacy.</p>

    <p>The purpose of the experiments described here was to develop a system for the growth of
     Theileria infected bovine cells in mice. T. annulata infected cells derived by in vitro
     infection were used for most experiments. Four different mouse strains were used: Balb/c,
     Balb/c nude, C57 beige and CB17 scid (severe combined immunodeficiency).</p>
    <p>In Balb/c and Balb/c nude mice, a radiation dose of 4Gy was required for growth of T.
     annulata infected cells as a subcutaneous tumour. Tumours became haemorrhagic and regressed
     after two to three weeks in Balb/c mice, but in Balb/c nude mice tumours continued to grow
     until the animals were destroyed at about four weeks post infection.</p>
    <p>C57 beige mice were not susceptible to tumour growth at the same radiation and cell] doses.
     In scid mice, T. annulata infected cells grew readily both as ascites and as subcutaneous
     tumours, without additional immunosuppression. Metastasis of infected cells to the mesenteries,
     gut, kKidney and lung was observed. Tumours did not regress in scid mice. Of the strains
     studied, the scid mouse appears to be the most favourable recipient for Theileria infected
     bovine cells.</p>

     fascioliasis, rat, antihepatotoxic drugs Fasciola hepatica infection in the rat causes a
     dramatic decrease in drug-metabolizing ability of the hepatic monooxigenase (MF0) and
     glucuronosyltransferase (GT) enzyme sys- tem. Moreover, peroxidative damage of membrane lipids
     (as assessed by tissue content of malonic dialdehyde, MDA, and the diene conjugation absorption
     in microsomal membranes) was found to occur over the entire course of the liver infection
     concomitant to the de- crease in glutathione levels. Most damage were observed between 30 and
     40 days post in- fection (MDA eight times the uninfected controls), when the loss in the enzyme
     activit- ies was maximal (MFO: 60/70%; GT: 65/95%). It suggests that the most likely initiating
     agent for the liver tissue damage in F. hepatica experimentally infected rats is the lipidic
     peroxidation, and it is the most causative agent in MFO and GT enzymes depres- sion. When 100
     mg/Kg i.p. of uridine-diphosphoglucose (UDPG) were administered weekly to experimentally
     infected rats for the entire course of the infection (40 days), the pa- rameters reflecting the
     integrity of the liver cell (serum glutamate-pyruvate, GPT, and glutamate-oxalacetate, GOT,
     transaminase) and the detoxifying capacity of the liver (cythocrome P-450, cytochrome b5,
     cythocrome P-450- dependent p-nitroanisole 0-demetylase and aniline hydroxylase activities, and
     the p-nitrophenol glucuronidation) were posi- tively affected. Moreover, the lipid peroxidative
     phenomen were greatly reduced.These re- sults confirme the validity to use F. hepatica
     infection in the rat as an alternative model to the evaluate the activity of potential
     scavenging and/or antihepatotoxic properties.</p>

     discovery of novel chemoprophylaxis for P. carinii infections is the lack of a system for in
     vitro cultivation. Whilst short term repli- cation has been reported in primary culture, often
     insufficient data has been published to attach a level of statistical significance to the
     increases perceived in vitro.</p>
    <p>A number of culture systems were evaluated in terms of their ability to support repli- cation
     of P. carinii: for any given system analysis of variance was used to distinguish significant
     changes in numbers of P. carinii nuclei from residual variation due to 1) sampling technique
     (within culture vessels), 2) replication (between culture vessels) and 3) between experiments.
     The potential transformation between different life-cycle stages and, in biphasic systems,
     exchange of organisms between the supernatant and feeder-cell layer were accounted for when
     interpreting the dynamics of P. carinii in culture. Significant replication was consistently
     demonstrated in some systems (eg.</p>
    <p>over MRC-5 cells) but not in others, and successful systems were used to examine the effects
     of antimicrobial agents and specific metabolic inhibitors: pentamidine significantly inhibited
     replication (IC50 = 0.5ug/ml). Extrapolation from an observ- ation of in vitro activity to a
     therapeutic effect in vivo was attempted: experiments employing : standard drugs in
     immunosuppressed rodents revealed that the outcome of therapy is clearly influenced by 1)
     intensity of infection, 2) drug-related adverse reactions and 3) concomitant infections. These
     studies provide an insight into the potential for discovery of novel chemoprophylaxis for P.
     carinii pneumonia and for its better management with existing drugs particularly in AIDS.</p>

     Division of Parasitology, Central Drug Research Institute, Lucknow, INDIA Monkeys, L. donovani,
     chemotherapy, relapse, clinical chemistry In Presbytis entellus (leaf monkey) and Macaca
     mulatta (rhesus monkey) the suscepti- bility, chemotherapeutic and immunological responses as
     also biochemical and haemato- logical changes were investigated following intravenous
     inoculation of Leishmania donovani amastigotes. In leaf monkeys after a single inoculation of
     1x10 amasti- gotes, spleen biopsy carried out on day 35 p.i. revealed 10-12 L.D. bodies/500
     cell nuclei. Sodium stibogluconate at 60 mg/kg x 10 days caused significant reduction of
     parasites (0-1 amastigote/500 cell nuclei) from spleen on day 7 of therapy but parasites were
     seen in skin (4-7 amastigotes/100 field)-the organ which was free from parasites before
     drugging, suggesting escape of amastigotes under drug pressure (1). Relapse occurred on day 34
     post treatment and this parasitice population was resistant to repeat therapy (120 mg/kgx30
     days). The elevation of IgG antibodies (observed by gel diffusion) in untreated animals was
     recorded from day 50.p.i.(245mg/ ml) which following therapy,came down to almost pretreatment
     level (155mg/ml) and again recorded a rise coinciding with relapse (321mg/ml). The above
     observations were well supported by haematological, biochemical and histopathological
     alterations.</p>
    <p>In rhesus monkeys following 3 inoculations of 1x1 amastigotes, each at one week apart, there
     were 8-65 L.D. bodies/500 cell nuclei in the spleen as assessed by biopsy on day 35 p.i. These
     animals also responded well to stibanate (100mg/kgx10 days) Relapse occurred in this animal
     also.</p>
    <p>The results suggest that the monkeys simulate human conditions and appear to be acceptable
     model for secondary screening and other related investigations.</p>

    <p>Department of Parasitology, Asahikawa Medical College, Hokkaido 078, Japan Alveolar hydatid
     disease - Germinal layers The viability of germinal layers of larval Echinococcus
     multilocularis is important for assessing the chemotheraputic effects in the patients with
     alveolar hydatid dis- ease (AHD). However, the viable sites of germinal layers in human lesions
     has not been investigated sufficiently. Using the large hepatic lesion resected from one AHD
     patient, we could estimated the viable sites by animal inoculations and histological methods.
     The patient was a 29-year-old Japanese woman, and computerized tomography, ultrasonography and
     serological examinations confirmed AHD. After surgical treat- ment, the liver right lobe with
     massive lesion became available for the experiments.</p>
    <p>Macroscopically, the liver was occupied with the solid spongy matters without normal liver
     tissues, and the center was liquefied. Several sites of the lesion were surgi- cally inoculated
     into the peritoneal cavity of inbred Chinese hamsters (Cricetulus griseus, CHA colony). The
     metacestode only developed in the animals inoculated with the surface sites of human liver
     lesion. By staining the human lesion immunohis- tologically with monoclonal antibody, the thin
     germinal layers were detected in the surface sites of liver lesion. The inflammatory reactions
     around laminated layers were also active in the similar sites, however terminated in the other
     inner sites.</p>
    <p>The excretory and secretory antigens from viable hydatids probably caused the inflam-
     mations. These results indicated that the hepatic alveolar hydatids in human were proliferating
     to outside and dying out in inside. Our methods will be available for evaluating the
     chemotheraputic effects by using the laparoscopical biopsy specimens from the surface sites of
     liver lesion in AHD patients.</p>

    <p>CYATHOSTOMUM SPP; Slcr EDTA; INTESTINAL PERMEABILITY; EQUINE In studies of intestinal
     permeability in human patients and laboratory animals it has been possible to demonstrate
     altered SlChromium ethylenetetraacetate (Sicr EDTA) absorption in subjects with enteropathies.
     The objectives of this study were to in- vestigate the suitability of SiCr EDTA absorption as a
     test of intestinal permeability in ponies and to monitor any alteration in Slcr EDTA absorption
     at various stages of cyathostome infection.</p>
    <p>Three ponies (Group A) were studied on three occasions : 1 week before ll} and 5(2) and 10(3)
     weeks following infection with two million Cyathostome spp. third stage larvae.</p>
    <p>Three ponies (Group B) were uninfected controls which were studied on one occasion only.</p>
    <p>Sicr EDTA was given by nasogastric tube and total urine and faeces collected at 12 hour
     intervals for a period of 72 hours. Urinary excretion of 51Cr EDTA was calculated as a
     percentage of the administered dose.</p>
    <p>The 72 hour urine EDTA excretions were: Group À - (1) 5.4 - 6.8% (2) 5.1 - 5.4% (3) 2.9 -
     5.3%; Group B - 2.4 - 6.9%.</p>
    <p>Although SiCr EDTA excretion was not affected by the cyathostome populations present in this
     study the test was considered worth developing as a means of investigating the pathogenesis of
     experimental gastrointestinal parasitic infections and also possibly for use in clinical
     parasitic an non-parasitic intestinal disease.</p>

    <p>Patch-clamp, piperazine, ivermectin, pyrantel, Ascaris suum It is now possible to apply the
     patch-clamp technique (Hamill et al 1981) to the study of the mode of action of antiparasitic
     drugs in nematodes (Martin, 1985; Martin &amp; Penningkon 1989). This technique allows
     observations on the very small currents (2x107°“A) which are seen to flow through single ion
     channels (transmembrane macramolecules) as they open and close. Small muscle vesicles were
     prepared by collagenase treatment of Ascaris suum flap preparations. A patch pipette was
     applied to the exposed membrane surface and the channel currents recorded with a high gain
     current to voltage converter. Piperazine-activated channels opened for around l4ms, had a
     conductance of 22pS and carried Cl ions; these channels were also activated by the inhibitory
     transmitter GABA. Ivermectin did not activate these channels but opened other Cl channels which
     had a smaller conductance (9-15pS) and which stayed open for a long time (&gt;1sec).
     Pyrantel-activated channels had a conductance of 40pS, carried K and Na ions, and were open for
     around 1.5ms; these channels were the same as those activated by the excitatory transmitter
     acetylcholine.</p>
    <p>These studies have allowed a more detailed description of receptor activation by
     antiparasitic drugs and may lead to a better understanding of the development of
     resistance.</p>

     DOGS: RM 340 VS. THIACETARSAMIDE AS A REFERENCE.</p>

    <p>Dirolfilaria immitis, heartworm, RM 340, thiacetarsamide, macrofilaricide Thiacetarsamide is
     the only heartworm adulticide to have been developed since 1950.</p>
    <p>Recent reduction in confidence in its effectiveness points to the need for both alternative
     drugs and more objective criteria by which to evaluate them. RM 340 is now being developed
     following our proposed new scheme for overall assessment of efficacy (OAE) of filaricidal drugs
     based on a combination of the percentage of worms killed and the percentage of dogs cleared,
     with specified ranges in percentages for very high, high, average, low or nil and overall
     categories with OAEs of "Highly Effective" (HE), “Partially Effective" (PE) and "Non-Effective"
     (NE). Data presented here on RM 340 was collected from controlled experiments using 82 beagles
     infected by IV transplantation of 10 pairs of Dirofilaria immitis and treated at 8 to 12 months
     of age (adults) and from controlled experiments using 63 beagles given 50 L; (SC) and treated
     at 4 months of age (immatures). Two dosages were selected for further development based on
     effectiveness against both adults and immatures and on flexibility in treatment schedule, with
     negligible reaction at the injection site. A dosage of 2.2 mg/kg x 2 given 3 hr apart was 96.0%
     effective against adults with 9 of 12 dogs cleared (OAE,HE) and 99.3% effective against
     immatures with 5 of 6 dogs cleared (OAE,HE). A dosage of 2.5 mg/kg x 2 given 24 hr apart was
     97.8% effective against adults with 8 of 12 dogs cleared (OAE,HE) and 95.8% effective against
     immatures with 3 of 6 dogs cleared (OAE,HE). In similar studies, the standard dosage of
     thiacetar-samide was 57.3% effective against 7 to 84-month-old adults with none of 7 dogs
     cleared (OAE,NE) and 29.8% effective against 4-month-old immatures with none of 5 dogs cleared
     (Blair et al., Proc. Heartworm Symp. 83) (OAE,NE).</p>

     Filariae in vitro, Litomosoides carinii, Culture conditions The success of in vitro culture
     systems for parasites may largely depend on serum or other supplements added to a basic culture
     medium. We inves- tigated adult Litomosoides carinii recovered from Sigmodon hispidus. The
     worms were maintained in medium RPMI 1640 (37°C, 5% CO2 in air) supplemented with either bovine
     serum albumin (400 yg/ml), human transferrin (30 ug/ml), bovine haemoglobin (1 mg/ml) or
     soybean lipids (40 ug/ml) which all significantly improved the survival time (+40-100%) and the
     proportion of intrauterine developing microfilariae (+20-30%), compared to non-supplemented
     medium. Without proteins or lipids worms became gradually hydrophobic indicated macroscopically
     by their floating on the medium. Coincidently, uptake and incorporation of %H-thymidine was
     reduced. It is concluded that amphiphilic proteins possibly bind to the surface of the worms
     and interfere with the transcuticular uptake of nutrients in vitro. This might be one of the
     major functions of the proteins contained in serum. With 10% Sigmodon serum, females survived
     for about one months and 60-70% of the embryonic stages already present in the uteri at the
     onset of maintenance developed to microfilariae and were released, i.e. embryogenesis
     continued. However, oogenesis ceased already after 3-6 days in culture and new eggs produced
     were most probably not fertilized. Worms cultured for 6 days were still able to survive and
     reproduce normally, if implanted to naive hosts. (Supported by the German Ministry for Research

    <p>The use of small laboratory animals habouring related parasites for studies in
     pharmacological and aspects of the biology of parasitic nematodes of domestic animals offers
     many technical as well as economic advantages. Neoheligmonella impudica a strongyle nematode
     occurs in over 75% of brown field rats Arvicanthis rufinus in Zaria Nigeria. The possible
     adaptation of this parasite in small laboratory hosts ïs explored. 8 of each worm free swiss
     white mice, white rats and cortisone treated white rats were infected orally with 200 infective
     larvae of N. impudica. Faecal samples were collected from each animal on daily basis and
     examined for ova of N. impudica.</p>
    <p>Autopsy was performed on days 5, 8, 11 &amp; 15 post infection. All the mice autopsied on
     days 5 and 8 had immature forms of the parasite in their small intestine. Mature worms were
     recovered on day 15 post infection. The mice started shedding ova in their faeces at day 12
     post infection. All the cortisone free rats did not show evidence of infection either before or
     after autopsy. Cortisone treated white rats started shedding ova in their faeces on days 9
     &amp; 11 post infection. At autopsy at day 15 mature worms were recovered. That the life cycle
     in the laboratory hosts is similar to that in the natural host, shows the potentials of this
     nematodè in research into endemic gastroin- testinal parasites of livestock.</p>

     purified and fresh sporozoites of E. tenella (Houghton strain) were incubated in salinomycin-Na
     (SAL) medicated and unmedicated medium 199 at 41°C for 10, 30 and 60 min, and stained with
     fluorescein diacetate (FDA)/propidium iodide (PJ) for 10 min. Shape, size and debris of
     sporozoites were registered by two-dimensional distribution of forward and 90 ° light scatter
     signals. Membrane integrity and esterase activity was measured by PJ exclusion and hydrolysis
     of FDA. The argon laser excitation was set at 488 nm and 250 mW. After 10 min incubation at 100
     ug/ml SAL two sub- populations of sporozoites were identified of which one showed high esterase
     activity. The other one with no esterase activity revealed increased PJ staining, demonstrating
     loss of membrane integrity; membrane damage increased with increasing incubation period.
     Concentrations of 10 4g/ml SAL and 1ug/ml SAL had a similar activity profile: after 10 min
     incubation there was a moderate increase in esterase activity, thereafter a time dependent
     decrease in esterase activity. At these concentrations no membrane damages occurred. These
     results indicate that flow cytometry is a sensitive, reliable and time-saving method for

     different kinds of corti- costeroids. We divided eighteen rats in three groups, all animals
     received tetracycline (500 mg/1) in drinking water to control secondary infections. Group 1
     received methyl- prednisolone (16 mg/kg) injections s.c. once a week, group 2 received
     dexamethasone in the drinking water (1 mg/1) and group 3 served as a control. Animals were
     autopsied after 62 days and lung and blood samples were collected. Cyst concentration was
     counted by digestion of lung tissue and staining the appropriate dilutions with Toluidine blue
     O.</p>
    <p>The methyiprednisolone group (1) had the highest cyst concentration 2.0 108 cyst/g lung
     tissue, the dexamethasone group (2) had 5.7 107 cyst/g lung tissue and the control group did
     not produce manifest pneumocystis infection. Lymphopenia was significant in both groups,
     neutrophilia was significant in group L and leukopenia in group 2 when compared to group 3.
     There were also differences in the red blood cell indexes between the groups.</p>
    <p>The catabolic effect, when measured as weight changes, was greatest in methylpredni- solone
     group, -43.1 %. The weights in group 2 decreased 10.9 7 and the weights in group 3 increased
     41.6 %. Different immunosuppression protocols yield Pneumocystis carinii infections of
     different intensity. This is probably due to a different influence on the immunostatus.</p>

     Twenty-four (12 male and 12 female) ferrets (Mustela putorius furo) were each given 20 third
     stage infective larvae of D. immitis by subcutaneous (SC) inoculation. A group of 6 ferrets was
     selected as nontreated controls. The remaining 18 ferrets were allocated to 4 groups of 4 or 5
     each and one month later were given ivermectin as single oral doses of 0.006, 0.0125, 0.025,
     and 0.05 mg/kg of body weight, respectively.</p>
    <p>One control animal died at 170 days postinoculation (PI), and adult worms were found in the
     heart and associated vessels at necropsy. The remäining animals were euthanatized at 219-227
     days PI. At necropsy, no worms were recovered from any of the treated ferrets, while all of the
     control ferrets had heartworms (mean recovery, 54%; range, 45-65%). Three of the 5 control
     ferrets had a few microfilariae at 217 days PI.</p>
    <p>Serum samples collected monthly were examined for adult heartworm antigen using the UNI-TEC*
     CHW test kit. None of the control ferrets were positive at 120 days PI, while 2 of 5 were
     positive at 150 days, and all were positive at 182 days PI. Sera from all ivermectin-treated
     ferrets were negative for the antigen throughout the experiment.</p>

    <p>P. falciparum drugtests - automatic analysis - Flow Cytometry À procedure was established to
     evaluate the development of malaria parasites in vitro, suitable for the automatic screening of
     large numbers of tests in an objective way.</p>
    <p>Culture material was fixed in the plate by adding fixing solution containing 0.25%
     glutaraldehyde in PBS. Plates were sealed and stored at 4°C until analysis. Before analysis the
     fixing solution was removed and replaced by staining solution containing 2 pM/ml Hoechst 33258,
     a DNA specific fluorescent dye. The material was sampled directly from the plate by an
     autosampling apparatus (AUTOmate, Becton Dickinson) and run through a flow cytometer (FACStar,
     BD). During analysis of the material, the fluorescence and light scatter parameters were
     recorded and stored by microcomputers. These data were analyzed by a computer program specially
     developed for this purpose. With the program the fluorescence and scatter characteristics of
     uninfected red blood cells, infected red blood cells and free parasites was used to determine
     parasitemia, reinvasion and development during schizogony.</p>
    <p>Many different in vitro tests can be analyzed in this way, without changing the normal
     culture procedures. The sample collection is simple, suitable for field research. The whole
     analysis procedure is done fully automatically, the sampling of material from the plates, the
     analysis and the calculation of parasite development until the direct representation of the
     results in graphs. The technique can be used for the in vitro screening of new drugs,
     evaluating culture conditions and for large scale epidemiological studies on drug
     resistance.</p>

    <p>TECHNIQUES FOR EVALUATION OF NEW DRUGS AGAINST CRYPTOSPORIDIUM O.Vanparijs, L.Quirijnen.
     Department of Parasitology, Janssen Pharmaceutica, 2340 Beerse Belgium Cryptosporidium parvum -
     Cryptosporidium baileyi Two models in laboratory animals are described to evaluate the efficacy
     of new drugs against Cryptosporidium spp. 5 In a first model, new-born mice pups.are orally
     infected with 1.10 oocysts of C.parvum.</p>
    <p>The oocysts are isolated from calf faeces by flotation in sucrose and purification.</p>
    <p>The new substances are administered orally at 20 mg/kg for 4 consecutive days. The autopsy is
     performed on day 7. The whole intestine is sonicated for a few seconds and the suspension
     diluted in malachite green for haemocytometer oocyst counts.</p>
    <p>In a second model, new-born chicks are orally inoculated with 1.109 oocysts of C.baileyi.</p>
    <p>The oocysts are collected from faeces of artificially infected chicks on postinoculation days
     (PID) 5 through 12. Before inoculation, oocvsts are concentrated by flotation using sugar
     solution, washed and purified. The chicks are treated with the new substance admixed in food at
     a 10 ppm dose level for 7 consecutive days. The autopsy is performed on day PID 8. The bursa of
     Fabricius is dissected and the luminal surface is scraped with a scalpel. The mucosal smear is
     diluted with one drop of carbolfuchsine on a microscopic slide. Immediately after dryving, a
     drop of oil is added. This smear is examined microscopically at a magnification of 500 for
     presence or absence of Cryptosporidium oocysts.</p>
    <p>Both models may be useful for screening new drugs. The chicken model is the least expensive
     since a limited number of cheap male chicks can be used and placed in individual cages. In the
     mouse model, however, the whole litter of pups is to be used for each new drug. Moreover, the
     oral treatment of new-born pups is delicate. Many substances are toxic and the daily
     manipulation mav cause some mortality.</p>

    <p>A CLINICALLY BASED MURINE MODEL FOR KATAYAMA FEVER Peter J. Weina, Walter Reed Army Institute
     of Research, Washington, DC, USA Katayama Fever, Murine Model, Biotelemetry Increasing reports
     of Katayama Fever in immunologically naive travelers to schistosomiasis endemic areas prompted
     this laboratory to search for a small animal model to study this syndrome. Inability to
     accurately, sensitively, and continuously monitor small animal models in the past has hampered
     experimental study of this syndrome. Review of the available case reports for Manson's Katayama
     Fever emphasized the prevalence of fever and lethargy in affected individuals. Consequently, ve
     developed a murine model that utilizes surgically implanted radio-transmitters to monitor
     temperature and activity changes in S. mansoni infected mice. We have found that at large
     parasite exposures, the hosts become lethargic and febrile on or about day 28 after infection.
     This condition exists for approximately 5 to 7 days after which the host slowly recovers.
     Cyclic changes in the host's body temperature and activity are maintained throughout
     asymptomatic, as well as, symptomatic infection. Ve have also found there is a narrow window of
     parasite load separating subclinical infection, clinically acute schistosomiasis, and lethal
     schistosomiasis. This clinically based, murine model for acute schistosomiasis should prove
     valuable in furthering our understanding of the mechanisms and management of Katayama Fever
     syndrome.</p>

     counts of 60 Merino ewes dosed with a Captec Controlled Release Capsule (CRC) releasing
     albendazole at 0.65 mg/kg/day for 100 days were compared with those of 30 untreated control
     ewes. All ewes were pregnant at the beginning of the study, and the CRC was administered 25
     days before lambing. Ewes and their lambs grazed as separate replicated treatment flocks of 10
     animals on pastures heavily contaminated with eggs and larvae Of naturally occurring
     benzimidazole-resistant strains of n and Ostertagia circumcincta. A single treatment with
     oxfendazole at 9 mg/kg (twice recommended dose) reduced faecal egg counts of sheep infected
     with these strains by 50%.</p>
    <p>Mean egg counts of CRC ewes did not exceed 80 epg during the 100-day release period of the
     CRC, compared with mean egg counts ranging from 1070 to 2900 epg for untreated ewes. By the
     time the lambs were weaned, 16 weeks after lambing began, mean egg counts of the CRC ewes were
     still below 280 epg, compared with 2480 epg for untreated ewes. Worm counts of 12 CRC and 6
     untreated ewes at weaning, some 2 months after the expiry of the CRC, showed that CRC ewes
     carried mean Ostertagia and Trichostrongylus burdens of 1000 worms, compared with 9000 and
     35000 worms respectively for untreated ewes. It was concluded that the CRC was effective in
     preventing infection with benzimidazole resistant strains of these parasites.</p>

     FREE, OR LIPOSOMAL, SODIUM STIBOGLUCONATE.</p>

    <p>L.donovani, mouse, sodium stibogluconate, liposomes Ât an early stage in liposome technology,
     it was proposed that carrier mediated drug delivery would greatly improve the treatment of
     visceral leishmaniasis caused by Leishmania donovani infection. This disease seemed an ideal
     model for this type of therapy since the L.donovani amastigote parasite lives within
     macrophages of the macrophage-monocyte system(MPS,Alexander and
     Vickermann,1975,J.Protozool.22:502).There- fore it is possible to passively target liposomal
     antileshmanial drugs directly to the parasitised host cells. Indeed, in experimental animal
     models up to 700 fold increases in drug efficacy were obtained in vivo as measured by
     suppression in liver parasite burdens (Alving et.al. 1978, Proc.Natl.Acad.Sci. USA 75: 2959;
     Black et.al., 1977, Trans. R. Soc.</p>
    <p>Trop. Med. Hyg. 71: 550; New et. al. 1978, Nature 272: 55). However, the spleen and the bone
     marrow are also important foci of infection and although liver parasite burdens may be greatly
     reduced those in the spleen and bone marrow may be unaffected, especially if large
     multilamellar liposomes are used to deliver the drug (Carter et.al.,1989, J.Pharm.</p>
    <p>Pharmacol. 41: 87). Therefore any drug formulation must be able to deliver the drug, for
     significant periods and at sufficient concentrations, to all parasitised tissues. In this study
     we present data on antimony tissue levels and parasite suppressions obtained in the spleen,
     liver and bone marrow after free and liposomal sodium stibogluconate treatment. The aim is to
     relate drug concentration and persistence to parasite susceptibility at each of the three
     target tissue sites as a means of predicting the minimal time-concentration envelope for 1007
     parasite suppression at these sites.</p>

     This characteristic reduces its efficacy in the tissular helminthosis.</p>
    <p>The present paper shows the results obtained with a new preparation of mebendazole (solid
     solution in polivinylpirrolidone) of higher solubility tested in an experimental model in mice.
     Doses of 100 and 50 mg/kg/day of classic mebendazole were compared with doses of 50, 25, 10 and
     5 mg/kg/day of the new mebendazole.</p>

     moderate degree of toxicity to the immune system of healthy mice. In contrast, liposome-
     entrapped drug injection did not interfere in any manner in the distribution or the function of
     splenic lymphocytes or macrophages. Most importantly, free tartar emetic chemoprophylactic
     treatment of mice led to significant resistance as assessed by liver worm burden. A
     significantly higher resistance was recorded after chemopro- phylaxis with

     is more effective than free chloroquine(CQ) in the prevention or treatment of malaria
     infections in mice. In contrast to treatment with free CQ, single injections of lipCQ can
     prevent or cure infections. Treatment with lipCQ does not result in high, potentially toxic
     blood levels even when the lipCQ dose administered is ten times the maximum permissible dose of
     free CQ. Clinically active levels are released from lipCQ depots for considerable periods of
     time, depending on the route of application. Particularly long periods of effective CQ release
     are obtained when lipCQ is administered intramuscularly or subcutaneous. LipCQ treatment can
     cure infec- tions with Plasmodium berghei parasites that are resistant against a high dosage
     regime of free CQ.In contrast to treatment with free CQ, lipCQ treatment of infections supports

     administrated drugs are disappointing and widely used intralesional infiltration with Pentos-
     tam or Glucantime is constraining . The present study reports some tests of a topical treatment
     : a meglumine containing ointment in a carbopol colloïd (gel).</p>
    <p>The first step was the study of the percutaneous penetration of ointment : i: in rats, by
     dosage of antimony ion in urine; ii: in man, localisation of drug into derm was proved by
     suction blister method.</p>
    <p>The effect of this topical treatment was determined by smears and culture technics from
     hamsters infected by L.major,bearing ulcerative or non ulce- rative experimental lesions and
     treated twice daily for a period of 30 days.</p>
    <p>The localisation of meglumine in derm was searched by ionic probe.</p>
    <p>Percutaneous penetration of drug is quite efficient in rat and in man. The effect of
     treatment seems to be better on ulcerative lesions, which clini- cally healed. The clearance of
     parasites in the sample of non ulcerative lesion was not obtained. However most of them
     suffered a bacterial secon- dary infection . These results are not conclusing enough to prove
     the ef- fectivness of percutaneous treatment by meglumine in cutaneous leishmania- sis though
     its percutaneous penetration was proved.</p>
    <p>Further work in another experimental animal (mouse) is in progress.</p>

     Switzerland CGA 157419, acarine grouth regulator, tick control, systemic CGA 157419, à novel
     benzoylphenyl urea, is a development inhibitor with specific acti- vity against Acarina,
     particularly against ticks (Ixodoidea) and extremely Low toxicity to mammals, The inhibitory
     effect of CGA 157°419 on tick development is due to inter- ference with cuticle formation
     during embryonic development and moulting.</p>
    <p>The compound is active against all instars of one and multihost ticks including strains
     resistant to chlorinated hydrocarbons, organophosphorous acaricides, carbamates, ami- dines and
     pyrethroiïids 1). Against ticks on cattle, CGA 157°419 shows excellent efficacy after topical
     as well as after systemic administration. When suitable oral, pour-on or injectable
     formulations are applied to target animals, the active ingredient (a,i.) is readily absorbed
     and circulates in the blood for extended periods. The Minimum Effective Concentration against
     ticks in cattle blood as determined by HPLC is species specific and varies from 10 to 40
     ppb.</p>
    <p>In controlled trials subcutaneous injection at a dose rate of 1 mg/kg a.i. protected cattle
     in Australia against reinfestation with Boophilus microplus for up to 12 weeks.</p>
    <p>Pour-on formulations were effective for up to 8 weeks at 1.5 mg a.i. / kg 1).</p>
    <p>In Australian, South American and African field trials CGA 157419 injectable formu- Lations
     protected cattle effectively agaïnst Boophilus spp. and suhstantially reduced both one and
     multihost tick populations.</p>
    <p>Due to its novel mode of action, its suitability for systemic use and its Long lasting
     efficacy CGA 157419 represents an important new development for tick control.</p>

     L'administration orale de substances actives est souvent décevante en raison de leur faible
     biodisponibilité. Pour améliorer celle-ci, le recours à des "vecteurs chimiques" permet d'en
     augmenter l'absorption et la distribution dans l'organisme. C'est pourquoi nous avons évalué
     une substance telle que le melphalan connue comme anticancéreuse et qui présente un effet in
     vitro sur les Filaires. En effet, le melphalan est filaricide à des concentrations de l'ordre
     de 1 mM/1 sur les stades adultes et larves infectantes de la Filaire Molinema dessetae, sans
     action in vivo. La prodrogue a été réalisée par estérification de la 1,3- dipalmitine en
     position 2, choisie pour son tropisme lymphatique. Le composé obtenu a conservé l'effet
     filaricide in vitro, un peu plus lent à apparaître ; de plus, il est macrofilaricide dans un
     traitement à 0,082 mM/kg en dose unique par voie orale.</p>

     anthelmintic activity of mebendazole against tissue helminth is limited by its solubility and
     absorption. In order to overcome this limit a new pharmaceutical water soluble form of
     mebendazole was prepared by solid solution of the drug in Polyvi- nilpirrolidone (PVP)
     (1:40).</p>
    <p>The anthelmintic activity of the preparation was tested against intracellular preadult stages
     and encysted larvae of Trichinella spiralis (GM-1 strain of T. spiralis “sensu stricto" in NMRI
     mice experimentally infected with 30050 larvae/mouseŸ and pre- adult and adult stages of
     Heligmosomoides polygyrus in NMRI mice experimentally infected with 100420 larvae/mouse.
     Results were compared with those obtained by using the classi- cal non-soluble mebendazole
     formulation.</p>
    <p>The efficacy of this new form was always greater than the plain isomorphic active non-soluble
     one. It resulted twice higher against preadult stages of T. spiralis and clearly superior
     against encysted larvae (100% of the new formulation versus 47% 6f the old one at the same
     dosage) keeping its activity statistically significant to as low doses as 3 times 3 mg/kg/day.
     H. polygyrus that use to be particularly resistant to benzimidazoles was also more sustesttote
     To the new pharmaceutical (Galenic) form of the drug.</p>

     (Cervus elaphus) is a significant agricultural industry. The most important parasite of farmed
     deer is the lungworm Dictyocaulus viviparus. The most effective anthelmintics for controlling
     lungworm have been either the injectable or oral forms of ivermectin.</p>
    <p>Recently, Merck, Sharpe &amp; Dohme have introduced an additional ivermectin formulation,
     Ivomec Pour-0n for Cattle onto the market.</p>
    <p>This paper presents the results of two pilot trials investigating the efficacy of Ivomec
     Pour-0n for Cattle against lungworm in young deer. Both trials used faecal larval counts as the

     Toxoplasma gondii, liposome, stearylamine, cytocidal activity The cytotoxic activity of
     stearylamine-bearing liposomes against Toxoplasma gondii (RH strain) was examined. When
     tachyzoites were treated in vitro with liposomes consisting of 20 mol% stearylamine and 80
     mol$% phosphatidylcholine (200 uM total lipids), over 95% of the parasites were killed within
     90 min. Cytocidal activity was still detectable with 25 uM. The liposome-treated tachyzoites of
     T. gondii showed significant swelling of the cell body. Intraperitoneal injec- tion of mice
     with 10 mg of 30 mol% stearylamine/70 mol®% phosphatidyl- choline-liposomes shortly before or
     after T. gondii challenge afforded protection from death for more than 30 days to up to 80% of
     the treat- ed mice, whereas all untreated mice succumbed within 9 days. The liposome-injected
     mice that survived remained symptom-free and behaved normally. These results represent a
     promising new strategy for the therapy of acute toxoplasmosis.</p>

    <p>2) les mollusques seuls sont mis en contact avec le produit pendant 12 heures.</p>
    <p>3) l'exposition des mollusques aux miracidiums est faite en présence du produit pendant 12

    <p>Pour chaque protocole, les expériences ont été faites à des doses différentes à savoir une
     solution mère (SM) à 3 x 10% M diluée au 1/128, 1/256, 1/512, 1/1024. Le comptage des
     miracidiums ayant pénétré a été effectué au microscope à partir de coupes sériées de mollusques
     fixés 24 heures après exposition, ce qui permet de distinguer les miracidiums se développant et
     les miracidiums dégénérant.</p>
    <p>Les résultats les plus nets consernent le conditionnement séparé des miracidiums au
     Praziquantel : il y a réduction importante du nombre de miracidiums entrant et aptes à se
     développer aux doses SM/128, SM/256, et SM/512 ; à la dose SM/1024, le taux est identique à
     celui des témoins. Qu'il s'agisse du conditionnement séparé de mollusques, ou simultané
     mollusque-miracidium, seule la dose SM/128 semble avoir un effet en réduisant le taux de

     Topoisomerases - Verapamil DNA topoisomerases | and Il are nuclear enzymes important for
     solving topological problems arising during DNA replication and transcription, and for other
     cellular functions. These enzymes have been shown to represent important targets for a variety
     of cytotoxic agents displaying different chemical structures. We have previously shown that
     dimethyl-2, 6 hydroxy-9 Ellipticinium (EIM) was a potent inhibitor of the topoisomerases from
     Trypanosoma cruzi (Tc/p). In the aim to study the mechanism of action of this drug, we have
     selected a T. cruzi subline resistant to ElM by addition of the drug to the culture medium in
     increased concentrations. After 20 months of subculture we have obtained a subline resistant to
     9 M of EÏM (Tc/ElM) with a stable resistance phenotype. Tc/EIM trypanosomes were
     cross-resistant to other ellipticine derivatives, ethidium bromide, acriflavine and berenil.
     All of these agents are trypanocidal drugs and they induce the loss of kinetoplast DNA in Tc/p
     and not in Tc/EIM. Tc/EÏM trypanosomes were not cross-resistant to the other inhibitors of
     topoisomerases (epipodophyllotoxin, anthracycline and m-AMSA). The verapamil, an agent which
     reverses the multidrug resistance phenotype (MDR) by increasing cellular drug accumulation had
     no effects on the resistant subline. Surprisingly, when the Tc/p trypanosomes were treated with
     verapamil, there were less sensitive to a variety of drugs such as ethidium bromide and
     ellipticine derivatives. Neither qualitative nor quantitative differences of topoisomerases
     could be detected between Tc/ElM and Tc/p. Our data suggest that the topoisomerases are not
     directly implicated in the biological processes which determine the resistance phenotype of
     Tc/ElM. Tc/EIM trypanosomes constitue a good model to study the drug action.</p>

    <p>Anthelmintic resistance, Ostertagia sp., Trichostrongylus sp., sheep Preventive strategies
     for the control of nematode infections of sheep are dependent upon few, critically timed
     treatments, with highly effective anthelmintics, to achieve sub- stantial reductions in
     parasitism. Where drug resistance occurs, mixtures of anthelmin- tics may provide a highly
     effective alternative treatment for use in these strategies.</p>
    <p>The efficacy of a mixture of albendazole oxide and levamisole, 3.6 and 8.25 mg/kg respec-
     tively, at single and double dose rates, was compared with the recommended dose rate of each
     anthelmintic alone. The comparison was conducted on groups of 6 to 14 week old lambs with
     infections of Ostertagia and Trichostrongylus spp. on 22 farms. Evidence of resistance to
     benzimidazole and levamisole was found on 16 of the farms. A single dose of the mixture reduced
     mean worm egg counts of sheep, by at least 95%, on half of the farms with evidence of
     resistance to both compounds and on all other farms. The double dose rate of the mixture was
     effective on all but 4 of the farms. Reductions caused by the mixture were due to the additive
     actions of the drugs on 18 of the 22 farms and Synergistic action was noted on only 3 farms.
     Naphthalophos, in combination with either a benzimidazole or levamisole, was also found to be
     highly effective on farms with multiple resistance and therefore also suitable for use in
     preventive control strategies.</p>
    <p>Assessments for drug efficacy on farms should include mixtures because there were no
     distinguishing features between farms with evidence of resistance to both compounds on which
     the mixture was effective and those on which it was not.</p>

    <p>The general purpose, intraruminal controlled release capsule, developed by CSIRO and l1-
     censed to Captec Pty Ltd, is an effective means of providing continuous low doses of
     anthelmintic to ruminants for periods of 100 days. Strategically timed treatment of capsules,
     releasing 32.5 mg/day albendazole, profoundly affects the epidemiological pattern of nematode
     infections of sheep. However, where the prevalence of nematode re- sistance to benzimidazole
     drugs is high, there is concern that the controlled release mode of application will escalate
     selection for resistance and fail to give the expected increases in animal productivity. In
     replicated experiments, changes in nematode res1is- tance and annual productivity from newly
     weaned lambs given Captec capsules were compared with those from lambs given oral treatments at
     strategic times and untreated controls.</p>
    <p>Prepared strains of Ostertagia and Trichostrongylus spp. containing about 20% of resis- tance
     genes, most being in the heterozygous state, were used to contaminate the experi- mental sites
     before treatments were given. Faecal egg count reduction tests showed no significant difference
     in efficacy between capsule and oral treatments; in each case efficacy was reduced from 94 to
     100% to between 50 and 65% over a 3 year period. Live- weight gains and wool production from
     treated sheep were significantly greater than untreated controls but not between capsule and
     oral treated groups,”even when oral treatments comprised ivermectin. The effect of reducing
     pasture contamination by 50% or more, at appropriate times, was sufficient to substantially
     reduce parasitism and increase productivity throughout the year. Captec capsules consistently
     achieve this effect, for at least 100 days, against nematode populations resistant to
     benzimidazole compounds.</p>

    <p>Cross-resistance to unrelated drugs has been previuosly observed in multidrug-resistant
     carcinoma cells and the goal of this work was to determine wheter a similar mechanism exists in
     Entamoeba histolytica.</p>
    <p>An emetine and colchicine-resistant clone C2(90), (IC50 = 62 uM, and i.5 mM, respectively),
     and the parental clone, A, (IC50 = 5 uM and l!I mM, respectively), were analyzed for resistance
     to other drugs and for the effect of verapamil. In the presence of verapamil, the IC50 for
     emetine was reduced to 0.5 uM, while the IC50 for colchicine was reduced to 0.3 mM. These
     results demonstrate that verapamil reverses both emetine and colchicine resistance in the
     mutant C2(90). -H-emetine accumulation was lower in resistant trophozoites. However, in the
     presence of verapamil, accumulation of 3H-emetine was increased in clone C2(90), to a level
     close to that of the parental strain, clone À.</p>
    <p>We identified multiple 344-bp segments of amebic DNA similar to the human
     multidrug-resistance (mdr) gene using primers to conserved regions of the P-glycoprotein and
     the polymerase chain reaction (PCR).</p>
    <p>PCR products identified in emetine-resistant mutants both an increased number of copies of
     the mdr-like gene and 4.5 kb mRNAs. These results are consistent with observations made using
     malaria and multidrug-resistant tumor cells, and suggest that a P-glycoprotein like molecule
     may play a role in drug-resistance in E. histolytica.</p>

     falciparum - chloroquine resistance - amlodipine Some calcium channel blockers reverse
     chloroquine (CQ) resistance in Plasmodium falciparum in vitro. To examine whether reversal of
     CQ resistance is stereospecific, CQ potentiating action of enantiomers of amlodipine, a
     derivative of nifedipine whose calcium blocker effect is exerted almost exclusively by its
     (-)-isomer, was studied in 3 culture-adapted strains of P, falciparum by in vitro
     semi-microtest. Additional experiments were done to determine the repartition of [3H)]CQ
     between the culture medium (M) and intraerythrocytic compartment (C) after 3 hours of
     incubation in the presence of amlodipine.</p>
    <p>The two enantiomers of amlodipine have identical intrinsic antimalarial activity in each
     strain (ICs0 in CQ resistant (CQ-R) clone FCM 29 C1 - 7.0 umol/1; CQ-R strain FCM 6 - 5.3
     umol/l1; CQ sensitive (CQ-S) strain L-1B - 11.4 nmol/1). Isobologram analysis shows that both
     enantiomers reverse CQ resistance at fixed concentrations between 1.25 and 3.75 umol/1.
     However, (-)-amlodipine is 2 to 3 times more effective than (+)-amlodipine in potentiating CQ
     action against resistant parasites. Studies on partition of [3H]CQ in the presence of
     enantiomers corroborate the findings of isobolograms (C/M ratio of 7.5 vs 9.4 for (+)- and
     (-)-amlodipine, respectively). As for the CQO-S strain, up to 5 umol/1 of amlodipine did not
     reduce the IC50 of chloroquine. These observations were confirmed in 3 CQ-R and 2 CQ-S wild
     strains.</p>
    <p>These results provide additional evidence against the hypothesis that reversal of CQ
     resistance is mediated by drug action on calcium channels.</p>

     cyproheptadine Cyproheptadine, a tricyclic antihistaminic, has relatively few and mila
     side-effects compared to other reversing agents of chloroquine resistance. Its efficacy was
     tested in vitro by semi-microtest in resistant and sensitive culture-adapted strains of
     Plasmodium falciparum. To evaluate its potential application in clinical trials, cyproheptadine
     present in the serum of two healthy volunteers 10 hours after a single oral dose of 16 mg was
     tested in combination with chloroquine predistributed in flat-bottom well plates against highly
     chloroquine-resistant clone FCM 29 C1. Suspension of erythrocytes (Hct 2.5%) from the
     volunteers with 20% of their serum and RPMI 1640 was used in the in vitro semi-microtest.</p>
    <p>Cyproheptadine alone has a weak antimalarial activity (IC50 between 6.1 and 13.4 mmol/1 in
     four strains of parasites). Isobologram analysis shows marked synergistic effect on chloroquine
     with cyproheptadine at fixed concentrations between 0.3 and 2.5 umol/1l in
     chloroquine-resistant strains. Enhancement of chloroquine action was not observed in the
     chloroquine-sensitive strains at 2.5 umol/1 of cyproheptadine.</p>
    <p>A slight, statistically non significant decrease in IC50 of chloroquine was observed in the
     presence of 20% of volunteers’ serum (668 vs 592 nmol/1 and 812 vs 649 nmol/1). Mild sedation
     was the only side-effect noted.</p>
    <p>The results demonstrate the difficulty of reproducing in vitro observations in in vivo
     conditions but do not rule out possible clinical use of cyproheptadine as reversing agent.
     Further in vivo studies are needed to evaluate the efficacy of cyproheptadine to reverse

     selected resistant strains of Fasciola hepatica in the field. Of 17 field isolates, 9 showed
     resistance and side resistance against closantel was evident. Resistance manifested against
     immature and rarely against mature fluke.</p>
    <p>Oxyclozanide, another salicylanilide was fully effective against adult fluke of susceptible
     and resistant isolates at low dose rates but doses effective against susceptible immature fluke
     the drug showed reduced efficacy against immature resistant fluke.</p>
    <p>A F.hepatica isolate was selected by 8 weekly drenching for 3 years with triclabendazole, a
     bhalogenated benzimidazole. Efficacy of the drug at comparable dose rates against the strain
     was appreciably lower than against strains never exposed to triclabendazole.</p>
    <p>Another isolate was selected in the laboratory by luxabendazole, a new broad spectrum
     benzimidazole compound by a high dose of the drug against fluke aged 8 weeks. Efficacy against
     the selected strain in sheep 6 weeks after infection was negligible compared to high efficacy
     achieved at similar dose rates against susceptible isolates. Three laboratory selections with
     clorsulon, a sulfonamide drug did not result in reduced efficacy against the strain.</p>
    <p>Through preferential selection for resistance in the immature stage, drugs effective against
     early immature fluke could lose their advantage in chemoprophylaxis of fasciolosis. Wide usage
     of a single highly effective drug is undesirable and resistance may develop against chemically
     unrelated drugs. A strategic programme with alternating drug use may be required in the future
     when resistance is established or suspected.</p>

     in-vitro micro- tests. An imbalance between the Northern and Southern parts of Cameroon
     previously observed in 1985-1986 was again observed. The EC50's of Chloroquine in the south
     ranged from 8 to 553 nMol (mean = 154 + 148 nMol) and 38 out of 74 (52 %) individuals harboured

    <p>The drug response of 9 T.b.gambiense isolates from patients in the Ivory Coast has been
     determined for Suramin, Melarsoprol and Pentamidine using a new in vitro test (Brun and Kunz,
     Acta Trop. 46, 361-368, 1989; Brun et al., Acta Trop. 46, 369-376, 1989). The assay is based on
     the incorporation of 8H-hypoxanthine in the presence of a serial drug dilution in Minimum
     Essential Medium according to Baltz et al. (EMBO J., 4, 1273-1277, 1985), and carried out in a
     microtiter plate. The cells were harvested, incorporated radiolabel measured in a liquid
     scintillation counter and the inhibition of incorporation determined. The drug concentration
     inhibiting incorporation by 50% (IC50) was then calculated. ICs0o values for Suramin ranged
     from 7 to 30 ug/ml, for Pentamidine from 2 to 7 ng/ml and for Melarsoprol from 0.5 to 4.6
     ng/ml. Two isolates which caused relapses after Melarsoprol treatment showed a sensitivity
     comparable to the one of the seven randomly selected isolates.</p>
    <p>Ten T.b.rhodesiense isolates from Uganda, Tansania and Ethiopia were selected and the
     sensitivity to Suramin and Melarsoprol determined. The ICs0 values showed significant variation
     in between the isolates. So-called resistant isolates had a highly reduced sensitivity to the
     two trypanocidal drugs. Data on Melarsoprol concentrations in CSF of patients after treatment
     are needed and have to be correlated to the sensitivity of these human isolates in order to
     find out whether drug resistant parasites can be the cause for relapses.</p>
    <p>At present it might be speculated that drug resistance in T.b.gambiense does not exist. On
     the other hand, T.b.rhodesiense isolates exhibited significant variations in Suramin and
     Melarsoprol sensitivity which may reflect the presence of drug resistant populations in the
     field.</p>

    <p>133 P. falciparum isolates from the Northern part of Cameroon were studied in-vitro at the
     end of 1988 using an isotopic microassay with daily prepared Mefloquine solution. According to
     the cut-off limit of 30 nMol, 26 isolates (20 %) were defined as being resistant to Mefloquine.
     In contrast among 77 additionnal isolates collécted in the Southern part of the country, only
     one was resistant.</p>
    <p>In-vivo 7 days assays were performed in the Northern area in 57 asymptomatic P. falciparum
     carriers aged 1 to 10 years who were given a 25 mg/kg single dose of LARIAM. Among 46 cases
     which could be followed up, P. falciparum asexual parasites were cleared within 5 days in 38
     cases, by day 6 and 7 in 2 cases and remained detectable up to day 7 in 6 cases. Apropriate
     concentrations of Mefloquine were found in day 3 blood samples from those patients, thus
     confirming that they should be considered as RII, RIII levels of resistance by in-vivo
     criteria. in 40 additional patients studied similarly in the South, no resistance was found.
     These observations were made before any Mefloquine drug pressure was exerted in the country.
     However results of cross-resistance and drug consumption suggest that in the North, Quinine use
     led to a primary Quinine resistance and a secondery Mefloquine resistance (without Chloroquine
     resistance), while in the South, Chloroquine use led to a primary Chloroquine-resistance and a
     secondery Quinine-resistance (without Mefloquine-resistance).</p>

    <p>Resistance, Malaria, Hydroxynaphthoquinone, Chemotherapy As resistance to known antimalarials
     is becoming widespread, it is in our interest to augment the mode of action studies on our
     compound, a hydroxynaphthoquinone (HNQ) 566C80, with investigation into possible resistance
     emergence. It was a logical step to develop a HNG-resistant strain of P.falciparum in house,
     using this as a model to determine mechanism(s) of HNQ insensitivity.</p>
    <p>There are several theoretical resistance mechanisms the parasite might utilise to overcome
     drug action. Of these, two have been investigated to date: induction of a pyrimidine salvage
     pathway and alteration in drug uptake between HNQ-sensitive and -resistant strains. Devel-
     opment of a salvage pathway was investigated by use of radiolabelled nucleotides and
     nucleosides. Using radiolabelled hypoxanthine incorporation as a growth control, experiments
     were done over 48 hours (a) to test for incorporation of the nucleosides and nucleotides and
     (b) to determine possible alteration in the ICc for 566C80 in their presence. Both parameters
     were investigated simultaneously. Drug upleke experiments with [1-7 "Cl 566C80 were done using
     synchronised cultures to determine life cycle differences that may have been present.</p>
    <p>Results so far, suggest that the resistance is due to an alteration in the site of

    <p>Malaria, Treatment, Arteether, Quinine, Mefloquine Arteether a novel antimalarial, highly
     active against different resistant strains of rodent malaria, is undergoing development.
     Arteether could be a fast acting compound like artemisinin and artemether, since similar type
     of recrudescence has been observed during animal studies. The two former compounds have been
     used for the treatment of acute cerebral malaria by parenteral route but recrudescence was a
     major problem.</p>
    <p>Moreover, such singular use of a drug may enhance the resistance development.</p>
    <p>The present group observed that Arteether administered simultaneously with Quinine by oral
     route resulted in excellent potentiation against chloroquine resistant P. berghei NS strain in
     mice. Arteether and Mefloquine combination also displayed potentiation to a comparatively
     lesser degree. The results have been evaluated in the form of isobologram. Earlier, using a
     28-day study, the group found that such combination could prevent the occurrence of
     recrudescence in rodent malaria. It is strongly evident from the present experiment that either
     Arteether with Quinine or Arteether with Mefloquine could be developed for the treatment of
     drug resistant malaria.</p>
    <p>The combination have shown excellent potentiation of in vitro activity against a multi- drug

    <p>Schistosoma - drug resistance - oxamniquine - metrifonate - praziquantel Resistance to drugs
     can develop in any species subjected to chemotherapy. In helminths, including Schistosoma, it
     is likely that resistance develops in a susceptible population of worms by selection of small
     numbers of naturally tolerant worms. With S. mansoni this has occurred in the laboratory by
     routine passage without the use of drugs and by selection with drugs. Selection can be
     undertaken in vitro or in vivo.</p>
    <p>In the clinic resistance has been reported to hycanthone and oxamniquine in Brazil, but it is
     not known how widespread the problem has become. In Kenya eggs passed by children after
     treatment with oxamniquine were passaged into mice and resultant worms were resistant to
     oxamniquine.</p>
    <p>Low cure rates with metrifonate may represent resistance, but low cost laboratory models do
     not exist to confirm this. The reason for incomplete cures with praziquantel have not been

     water at 37°C for 5 hr, fixed in formaldehyde solution, and stored for subsequent examination.
     Stomach contents were examined using à stereomicroscope (15-45X). Doses of levamisole
     hydrochloride and its analogs which elicited percentage clearances of 293 for the susceptible

     process (5, 10, 20, 50, 100, 500 and 1000 M) as described by Coderre et al.
     (PNAS,80:2132-2136,1983). The time required to induce MTX resistance at the maxi- mum
     concentration (1000 uM) was 188 days. The effective concentration of MTX which inhi- bited the
     growth of wild type and the 1000 uM resistant line (MTX-R1000) by 50% (EC50) was 16 and 14,000
     uM respectively and the resistance index (EC50 after drug pressure/ EC50 without drug pressure)
     at the maximum MTX concentration was 875. Resistant lines were also obtained by direct
     adaptation of the 10 uM resistant line to 1000 yM MTX.</p>
    <p>These rapidly adapted resistant lines have the same EC50 as the stepwise adapted line.</p>
    <p>We also studied wild type and MTX-R1000 susceptibility to other unrelated drugs such as
     puromycin and ketoconazol. Results showed that MTX-R1000 presented moderate cross-resis- tance
     to both drugs. Finally we studied MTX transport in wild type and MTX-R1000 by short term
     incorporation studies using 100 nM (H°)-MTX (48.5 Ci/mmol) in folate depleted medium as
     described by Kaur et al. (J.Biol.Chem.,263:7020-7028, 1988). The rate of uptake of (H°)-MTX
     into MTX-R1000 was less than 1% of that of wild type. This mechanism is common to other MTX
     resistant Leishmania species as described by Ellenberger and Beverley
     (J.Biol.Chem.,262:10053-10058,1987) and kaur et al. (1988).</p>

     drug resistance, Chloroquine, therapeutic trial In January 1987, a preliminary study was
     conducted on 1821 individuals living along the Oyapock and Maroni rivers, the two main regions
     endemic for malaria in Frénch Guyana.</p>
    <p>P. falciparum infected individuals received chloroquine 25 mg/kg in 3 days, according to the
     WHO recommendation. They were evaluated clinically during 8 days and thick smears as well as
     serum chloroquine level determination were performed daily.</p>
    <p>In vivo resistance was found in 28%. However, 6% had insufficient chloroquine levels, hence
     only 22% were considered true resistance.</p>
    <p>In November 1987, a second study was realised to compare the therapeutic efficacy of an
     increased dose of chloroquine (40 mg/kg in 4 days) to the usual given dose (30 mg/kg/ in 3
     days), and to perform in vitro drug sensitivity test to chloroquine, quinine and mefloquine.
     Increasing the dose of chloroquine improved drug pharmacokinetics resul- ting in an earlier
     parasite clearence.</p>
    <p>During this second therapeutic trial, in vivo resistance to chloroquine was 20%, and a
     corresponding 23% in vitro resistance was observed. No in vitro resistance to quinine was
     found, but 5% of the strains were resistant to mefloquine, all of which came from along the
     Oyapock river. CHloroquine still remains the first drug of choice for malaria therapy in French
     Guyana, but the non-negligeable resistance already prevailing argues in favor of a closer
     surveillance of drug resistance in this country.</p>

     chloroquine, pH, drug resistance The antimalarial mode of action of chloroquine (CQ) has been
     investigated in great details in recent years, but the overall mechanism is still
     controversial. Instead of further dissecting the molecular aspects of partial reactions, a
     model based on the weak base properties of CQ and its pH-driven accumulation in acid parasite
     compartments has been devised, and the integrated response of the parasite to the drug under
     different experimental conditions has been assayed to verify the validity of the model. Factors
     such as inoculum size (parasitemia ‘+ hematocrit) and medium pH were altered using CQ-sensitive
     (FCC:) and -resistant (FCR3, VNS) isolates of Plasmodium falciparum. Experimental results were
     in full agreement with the predictions of the model and showed that therapeutic concentrations
     of CQ do not raise the pH of the food vacuole. i.e., that alkalinization of the acid parasite
     compartments is an insufficient explanation for the antimalarial activity of CQ. There was no
     need to invoke an active CQ efflux pump to explain drug resistance. Using the experimental data
     in calculations based on the model, the vacuolar pH of FCC,;, was found to be 4.60, that of
     FCR:3 was 4.89 and that of VNS was 4.93. The vacuolar CQ concentration at ICso was (in mM) 1.34
     for FCC:, 0.42 for FCR3 and 4.71 for VNS.</p>
    <p>Thus, resistance to CQ is correlated with higher pH and/or higher resistance of the
     intracellular target to the drug concentration in the parasite food vacuole. The data have also
     implications for the design and interpretation of in vitro CQ inhibitory tests.</p>

    <p>Leishmania infantum - Dog - Meglumine antimoniate - Susceptibility Meglumine antimoniate
     (Glucantime), a first-line drug for the treatment of human leishmaniases, is also commonly used
     to treat canine leishmaniasis. In symptomatic dogs, the drug produces only temporary remission
     of clinical signs, relapses being frequent and infectivity to sandflies remaining high even
     after several courses of the drug. A study was undertaken to investigate whether any change in
     susceptibility to Glucantime would occur in Leishmania in dogs under treatment. L. infantum
     strains, isoenzymatically typed, were obtained from both untreated dogs and dogs treated with
     3-6 courses of Glucantime. The parasites were grown in outbred hamster and in vivo
     susceptibility tests were carried out. Amastigotes from infected hamster's spleen were
     inoculated iv in Balb/c mice. From day 10, groups of mice were treated at the daily doses of
     O.01 to 1,000 mg/kg of Glucantime (0.0028 to 280 mg/kg of SbV) for 5 consecutive days. A
     control group was left untreated. The mice were then killed and the amastigote load determined
     according to Stauber's method. Parasite inhibition data were analysed through a probit analysis
     program for calculation of ED50 and ED90. Results showed that both indices were generally
     higher for Leishmania strains isolated from dogs after treatment than those observed for
     strains isolated before treatment. For two strains obtained from a same subject, for example, a
     ten-fold increase of both ED50 and ED90 was found. These findings strongly underline the
     uselessness and danger of repeated antimonial treatments of subjects representing a permanent
     parasite reservoir.</p>

     metronidazole by elimination of pyruvate oxidizing pathway in hydrogenosomes. In these
     organisms glucose is completely metabolized to ethanol and CO,. Two redox reactions in the
     trichomonad glycolysis dif- fer by their coenzyme specificity: the glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate

     strictly specific to NADP. Search for a pyridine nucleotide transhydrogenase was
     unsuccesful.</p>
    <p>Instead, a following pathway catalyzed by phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase, NAD-malate

     oxaloacetate + NADH, = malate + NAD+ (3) malate + NADP* = pyruvate + CO) + NADPH; Existence of
     this bypass in the T.foetus glycolysis correlates with the fact that activities of the bypass
     enzymes of either parent or drug-resistant strains exceed activity of key glycolytic enzyme
     pyruvate kinase by more than one order of mag- nitude. In the resistant T.foetus strong
     activity of NADP dependent malic enzyme was found in cytoplasm in form of two isoenzymes. This
     is the first finding of malic enzyme in cytosolic cell compartment of T.foetus. À low activity
     of identic isoenzymes was detected also äin cytoplasmic fraction of the drug-susceptible parent
     organism, where the major activity of malic enzyme was hydrogenosomal and different in its

     goats that had been treated with ivermectin pre-kidding and then turned onto pastures carrying
     a benzimidazole resistant strain of T. circumcincta were followed throughout the 1989 grazing
     season. The efficacy of routine treatments with ivermectin, fenbendazole and levamisole was
     assessed in does and kids using the faecal egg count reduction test during the period at
     grazing and using a critical efficacy test on groups of does at the end of the season. Over the
     season treatment with ivermectin, fenbendazole and levamisole reduced doe and kid faecal egg
     counts by 98.97%, 07 and 15.17% respectively. Does treated with ivermectin on five occasions
     during the grazing period showed no evidence of acquired anthelmintic resistance. Ivermectin,
     fenbendazole and levamisole treatments proved to be 94.47, 0% and 22.87 effective against
     abomasal parasites but more than 997 effective against intestinal parasites.</p>
    <p>Conservation of product efficacy appears to be particularly important in goat husbandry since
     goats are often associated with the early development of anthelmintic resistance, underdosing
     and excessive treatments should be avoided.</p>

    <p>Synthetic pyrethroid pour-on treatments for control of sheep biting lice (Damalinia ovis
     Schrank) were introduced in Australia in 1981. In 1986 reports of failure of some of these
     treatments were received from the field. 35 strains of lice collected after such treatment
     failures were subjected to an ïin-vitro treated surface technique to establish their tolerance
     to different SP insecticides Ccypermethrin, deltamethrin, alphamethrin and cyhalothrin) and to
     diazinon, a frequently used organophosphate (Levot and Hughes 1989 in press). SP resistance
     factors ranging from 0.8 to 26.2 were determined. There was no indication of any functional
     resistance to diazinon. Groups of 3 sheep infested with some of these strains were then dipped
     in cypermethrin at concentrations ranging from ppm (the discriminating dose for susceptible
     lice) up to 4ppm. Good correlation was obtained between ïin-vitro and in-vivo results. Groups
     of infested sheep were also treated with commercial short and long wool pour-on SP treatments,
     all of which failed to control resistant strains. (Commercial strength SP dips (12-19ppm) were
     efficient against resistant strains. The reliance of the pour-on formulations on diffusion of
     the SP from the back of the sheep to other areas of the skin appears to be an important factor
     contributing to the selection of lice for tolerance to the SP insecticides.</p>

    <p>Anthelmintic Resistance Genetics Benzimidazole Levamisole Trichostrongylus Studies on
     benzimidazole and levamisole resistant strains of T.colubriformis were under- taken to
     elucidate the inheritance of resistance to these anthelmintics. Reciprocal crosses of parasitic
     stages of resistant and susceptible worms produced F, offspring which were interbred to produce
     F, or backcrossed to the parental strains. Resistance was assayed in parental strains and
     crossed by in vitro and in vivo methods and the dosage-mortality lines analysed and compared.
     It was concluded that benzimidazole resistance was inherited as an incompletely recessive,
     polygenic character with a strong maternal influence. In contrast, the major variation for
     levamisole resistance could be explained by a single, recessive gene (or group of genes) on the
     X-chromosome with some additional, autosomal, polygenic influence. These data suggest that
     increasing the dose rate of the anthelmintic will increase the functional recessiveness of the
     genes for resistance and thus, will remove those worms carrying resistance genes in the herero-
     zygous state. This strategy will delay the initial onset of resistance. In a field situation,
     this is achieved by treating all animals at a dose volume appropriate for the heaviest sheep in
     the flock.</p>

    <p>Anthelmintic Resistance Benzimidazole Levamisole Trihostrongylus Ostertagia Studies on the
     genetics of resistance have suggested that highly efficient anthelmintics will delay the
     initial onset of resistance. To evaluate the ability of combinations of anthelmintics to
     achieve this, changes in the degree of resistance were measured in T.colubriformis and
     Ostertagia under selection from anthelmintics used singly or. in com- bination. Resistance was
     measured by in vitro and in vivo methods over six generations of selection in each of which 10%
     of the population escaped selection. Resistance to a benzimidazole and levamisole developed
     within 3-4 generations where 90% of the population was exposed to either of these anthelmintics
     alone. However, where the recommended dose of a benzimidazole and levamisole were given
     together, susceptibility to both compounds was maintained. Similarly, no resistance developed
     when a benzimidazole and ivermectin combination wes given. The high efficiency resulting from
     the use of a combination, ensured that the major genetic contribution to subsequent generations
     of worms originated from the component of the population that escaped anthelmintic exposure in
     each genera- tion. Extrapolating the concept to a field situation indicates that the high
     efficiency achieved by combining anthelmintics will ensure à major contribution from the
     unselected component of the population in the free-living stage at the time of treatment.</p>

    <p>2.falciparum - hydroxynaphthoquinone - resistance - mitochondria - chemotherapy À
     hydroxynaphthoquinone (HNQ) antimalarial 566C80 has been developed at the Wellcome Research
     Labs., U.K. and is currently undergoing phase II clinical trials. This compound shows excellent
     schizontocidal activity against the both sensitive and drug resistant malaria together with
     causal prophylactic activity against EE stages of P.berghei.</p>
    <p>Despite a novel mode of action and lack of obvious cross-resistance to known anti- malarials,
     the emergence of resistance to the new HNQ must be considered. In order to determine the
     possible mechanisms of such resistance, we have developed a HNQ-resistant strain of
     P.falciparum using an in vitro relapse technique with sequential increase in drug pressure. The
     relapse technique produced an initial low level phenotypic resistant line with subsequent
     development of low level (10 fold) stable resistance.</p>
    <p>Continuing drug pressure over several months, a strain was produced which demonstrated a high
     level (1500 fold) resistance. This highly HNQ-resistant line retained its sensitivity to other
     antimalarials. The mode of action of 566C80 is due to impairment of parasite mitochondrial
     function at the complex III site, a major consequence of this is the inhibition of the de novo
     pyrimidine biosynthesis. We have been unable to detect differences in drug uptake by comparison
     of the resistant with the sensitive strain using [1-14C] 566C80 or the development of a
     pyrimidine salvage pathway in the HNQ-resistant strain. Evidence to date indicates that
     resistance occurs as a result of a change at the target site itself, with mitochondria from the
     resistant strain showing reduced sensitivity to 566C80.</p>

    <p>The study was designed to evaluate how exposure of Plasmodium falciparum to mefloquine
     modifies the sensitivity of the parasite to 4 major antimalarials. À recently culture- adapted
     strain of P. falciparum was subjected to intermittent drug pressure with 3 diffe- rent
     mefloquine concentrations (9.37, 4.68, 2.34 ng/mi ). Growth was monitored by daily evaluation
     of parasitemia on thin smears. 50% inhibitory concentrations (IC 50) were ob- tained weekly,
     using a radioisotonre microdilution method. Mefloquine was suppressed from culture media when
     decreasing parasitemia was observed, and reintroduced when multiplica- tion reoccured. As
     expected, parasite survival was inversely proportionnal to drug con- centrations. The parasites
     orogressively tolerated higher concentrations of mefloquine with prolonged exposure to the
     drug. Throughout this adaptation, the ICS0 for chloroquine and quinine showed no modification,
     but increased considerably for mefloquine, twice ex- ceeding known levels of resistance.
     Furthermore, a parallel decreased sensitivity to halo- fantrine was observed. Despite an
     absence of an established level of resistance £or this more recent antimalarial, levels reached
     under drug oressure were significantly higher than the mean ICS0 reported from fresh isolates.
     This cross-resistance between mefloquine and halofantrine, suspected by epidemiological in
     vitro surveys and shown by clone analy- sis, are confirmed in this study. These findings may
     have important in vivo consequences and eventually affect the choice of antimalarial

    <p>The greatest threat to new antimalarials is without doubt the ease with which resistance is
     developed by the malaria parasite. The reversal of chloroquine-resistance by administering a
     combination of chloroquine with a second compound, such as cyproheptadine or desipramine, has
     been shown both in vitro with Plasmodium falciparum and in vivo with P.</p>
    <p>yoelii. Our present studies are aimed at extending this principle to other types of
     experimentally-induced antimalarial drug resistance in an attempt to give protection to some of
     the more recently introduced compounds. We have so far been able to reverse resistance to

    <p>Haemonchus contortus, closantel, salicylanilides, sheep Closantel ïis a salicylanilide
     anthelmintic used to control Haemonchus_ contortus and Fasciola hepatica. The properties of
     closantel, namely ïts high efficacy, persistence in plasma and its ability to prevent
     reinfection for up to 28 days after treatment has been used to advantage in strategic programs
     to control haemonchosis in sheep. Control failures and re- emergence of H.contortus in some
     areas were investigated for the possibility of the presence of resistance. Preliminary results
     indicated low level resistance was present in 3 isolates of H.contortus. Further critical
     slaughter studies at a number of dose rates have demonstrated varying levels of resistance in 6
     ïisolates from northern New South Wales in sheep and goats. Resistance has been found on
     properties where there has been both extensive and minimal use of salicylanilides. The
     protection period given by a single treatment with closantel is effectively eliminated with low
     to moderate levels of resistance. A higher level of resistance ïis present in larvae compared
     to early adult parasites. Side resistance to other salicylanilides, (rafoxanide) and
     monophenols (nitroxynil) is present in isolates resistant to closantel. Plasma closantel assays
     support the close dose relationship between plasma closantel and efficacy. The prolonged plasma
     life of closantel is likely to predispose to development of resistance, although the high
     efficacy against adult H.contortus may delay the widespread development of resistance.</p>

    <p>Haemonchus contortus, æ&amp;- and f-tubulin, benzimidazole resistance, sheep parasite.</p>
    <p>The group of benzimidazole (BZ) anthelmintics are widely used to control parasitic nematode
     infections. However, resistance to these drugs may develop upon frequent use.</p>
    <p>Little is known about the molecular mechanisms that are involved in the BZ resistance in
     parasitic nematodes. Previous studies indicated that the benzimidazoles acted through binding
     to tubulin and that in resistant strains tubulin with a lower binding affinity was present.
     Therefore we started the characterization of aœ- and f-tubulin genes from the parasitic
     nematode H. contortus. A genomic Library was constructed and œ- and f- tubulin clones were
     isolated and sequenced. These clones were used as probes in the Southern blot, to analyze the
     restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) present in the DNA isolated from larvae of 3 BZ
     susceptible and 3 resistant populations, isolated from different geographical locations. The
     banding patterns indicated that there was correlation between the number of fB-tubulin reactive
     fragments and resistance to BZ. No correlation was found with presence or absence of any
     fragment that reacted with the a- tubulin probe. In resistant populations a reduction of the
     number of f-tubulin reactive fragments was found. The selected fragment(s) were however already
     present in a low incidence in the DNA of the susceptible populations. Analysis of individual
     male adults from an in vitro selection experiment indicated that the reduction of B-tubulin
     reactive fragments was the result of selection of resistant individuals, carrying this
     fragment, from the susceptible population and not from gene déletion(s) after BZ treatment. In
     order to locate the structural difference(s) between the selected fragment and the other
     fragments that are present in the susceptible populations, further analysis is being carried
     out.</p>

    <p>PRODUCTION OF A BERENIL RESISTANT POPULATION OF TRYPANOSOMA CONGOLENSE IN VITRO C.A. Ross,
     A.M. Taylor. Centre for Tropical Veterinary Medicine, Easter Bush, Roslin, Midlothian EH25 9RG,
     Scotland Trypanosome culture — drug resistance This work describes the induction of
     Berenil-resistant trypanosomes from a cloned Zambian isolate of T. congo— lense. The original
     wild type (WT) population was sensitive to Berenil in vitro and in vivo. Procyclic WT trypano-
     somes were cultured for 6 months in increasing concentrations of Berenil, eventually resulting
     in populations which tolerated the continuous presence of 0.2 ug/ml of drug. In vitro
     transformation to epimastigote and metacyclic forms was carried out in cultures where medium
     contained 0.1 ug/ml Berenil. The resulting blood- stream form trypanosomes appeared after
     injection of mice with cultured supernatants containing infective metacyclics. Relapse
     populations of bloodstream forms were obtained by treating mice with 20 mg/kg Berenil and these
     parasites were transformed again to procyclics in vitro for maintenance in continuous culture.
     Since investi- gation of the mechanism of drug resistance is ideally carried out in populations
     of parasites who differ only in their drug sensitivity, the metabolism of these T. congolense
     WT and Berenil resistant populations is being compared at several life cycle stages.</p>

     Characterists, Anthelmintic Resistance, Haemonchus contortus Investigations were carried out to
     compare characteristics of a strain of Haemonchus contortus resistant to benzimidazoles,
     salicylanilides and ivermectin, and an anthelmin- tic sensitive strain.</p>
    <p>The pathogenicity of the resistant and sensitive parasites was compared by monitoring the
     development of anaemia, changes in plasma proteins and abomasal damage in groups of six lambs.
     There were no significant differences in any of these parameters suggesting that the resistant
     and sensitive strains had similar pathogenicity. The infection rate i.e.</p>
    <p>the number of parasites establishing after infection and the fecundity of the two strains was
     similar.</p>
    <p>The number of infective larvae obtained from eggs after incubation over a range of temp-
     eratures from 4°C to 28°C was significantly lower for the resistant strain compared with the
     susceptible parasites.</p>
    <p>The uptake of ivermectin by first stage larvae, third stage larvae and adult parasites of
     both strains was estimated in vitro. The mechanism for development of resistance was not due to
     decreased drug uptake and in some experiments resistant parasites accumulated higher
     concentrations of ivermectin than sensitive parasites.</p>
    <p>The development of resistance to a range of anthelmintics in this strain of H.contortus did
     not reduce the pathogenicity of the parasites. There was a decrease in the surviv- ability and
     hatchability of resistant parasites. This may have implications for pasture contamination.
     However, these differences could reflect the differing sources of the parasites.</p>

     Charles University, 128 44 Prague 2, Viniénâ 7, Czechoslovakia Trichamonas vaginalis, drug’
     resistance, metronidazole T. vaginalis can develop resistance to metronidazole by two different
     mechanisms.</p>
    <p>Anaerobic" resistance is caused by elimination of metabolic pathway providing electrons for
     reductive activation of the drug. ‘Aerobic'' resistance is ascribed to defective oxygen
     scavenging by the parasite allowing interference of intracellular oxygen with activation of the
     drug. Manifestation of ‘'aerobic'' resistance is oxygen dependent; under anaerobiosis the
     organisms are susceptible to metronidazole. We found that anaerobic cultivation of drug
     susceptible T. vaginalis in the presence of low concentration of metronidazole (2-3 yg/ml)
     resulted in development of the ‘'aerobic'"' resistance. Minimal lethal concentrations (MC)
     determined in aerobic susceptibility assays increased from 4.8 up to 283 ug/ml after 50
     transfers in TYM medium with metronidazole. At the same time the increase of anaerobic MLC was
     rather low (from 1.6 to 6.25 yug/ml).</p>
    <p>Susceptibility assays performed in controled gas mixtures with different concentrations of O,
     (1-20%) proved that the resistance is dependent on O0, and demonstrated that the MIC values for
     a given strain can be modulated by changes in O; concentration. The threshold concentration
     required for demonstration of resistance was 5% O,. Resistance of the in vitro obtained strains
     was confirmed in vivo by subcutaneous mouse assay. The dose of metronidazole needed to cure 50%
     of infected mice (DC) was 6.6 and 223 mg/kg x 3 for the parent strain and its resistant
     derivative, respectively. Aerobic MLC values and other properties of the in vitro developed
     strains were comparable to those of clinical isolates from patients nonresponsive to treatment.
     The in vitro developed strains, derived from defined drug susceptible parents might be useful
     in study of “aerobic'' resistance to metronidazole, mechanisms of which are still poorly
     understood.</p>

    <p>Seventy-one ‘worm-free’ lambs innoculated individually with 5000 third stage larvae and
     managed so as to avoid re-infection were randomised on faecal egg count and/or liveweight into
     12 treatment groups. Six groups (A1-A6) were drenched 28 days and 6 groups (L1-L6) 5 days after
     infection. lvermectin was given at O, 50, 100, 200, 400 or 800 mcg kg body weight.</p>
    <p>In order of ascending rate of ivermectin delivery, geometric mean adult worm burdens
     estimated 14-15 days after drenching lambs with mature infections (A1-A6) were 1084, 1301,

    <p>Correspondingly, treatment of lambs with immature infections (L1-L6) yielded geometric mean
     adult burdens of 2515, 2693, 2446, 2852, 1955 and 647.</p>
    <p>Although there was a dose response against both mature and immature infections, ivermectin
     given at 4 times the recommended therapeutic dose rate (800 mcg kg }), removed only 89.9% of

    <p>Sampling areas were chosen along south-north transects, so to have the main ecological zones

     71 An.arabiensis, 2,282 An.qgambiae and 1,302 An.melas, and the chro- nosomal polymorphism
     within each species was studied. An.arabiensis was sampled only in 5 northern localities where
     it shows the same inversion polymorphisms described in other areas of West Africa. An.gambise,
     found in all localities, shows a south-north clinal chromosome differentiation. The standard
     2R-2L arrangement, typical of the forest chro- nosomal form, prevails in the Southern more
     humid zones, but its frequency was found definitely lower than that observed in Southern Ivory
     Coast and Southern Nigeria, The inverted arrangements èLa and 2Rb increase their frequency
     towards northern drier savan- nas. In some northern localities a marked increase of 2Rbc
     arrangement was noted 3ss0- ciated with dry season breeding. In two localities of Northern Togo
     the rise of 2Rbc is also associated to Hardy-Weinberg disequilibrium, supporting the presence
     of the chromo- somal forms Mopti and Savanna, fin.melas is restricted to coastal areas, its
     breeding depending on salt water. The environmental change from traditional villages to
     unplanned urban settlements without proper drainage of rain water favours its replacement by
     An.gambise. À 2Rni/+ inversion polymorphism was observed in An.melas and parallel the ERn/+
     polymorphism recorded in The Gambia and Guinea Bissau, The inversions n snd ni have very
     similar but not coincident break-points and they both show geographic and seasonal variations

     predominantly zymodeme LON-4. Between 1982 and 1986 extensive studies were carried out in the
     Eastern Province where Phlebotomus papatasi was proved to be the vector of L.major.</p>
    <p>During 1987 this author made regular sandfly collections near Abha town where cases of CL due
     to L.tropica are prevalent, using light and sticky traps. Of 8,000 sandflies caught, 1,600
     female Phlebotomus were dissected. Among 261 Ph.sergenti were two infected with Leishmania
     promastigotes which were successfully cultured. By isoenzyme typing these organisms proved to
     be L.tropica, zymodemes LON-10 and LON-71 respectively, zymodemes which are also present in
     human isolates from the same area.</p>
    <p>The seasonal distribution of both Ph.sergenti and cases of CL were followed for a year,
     revealing a peak of sandfly numbers and transmission in July. The data obtained from these

     The sera against R.evertsi recognised the homologous and less stronglyÿy the heterologous
     sections. The sera against A.variegatunm recognized the homologous sections but only labelled
     weakly the basement membrane of Some organs in the heterologous sections. The most marked
     labelling was shown in the qgut, malpighian tubules, salivary gland type I and interstitial

    <p>Anopheles stephensi - sporozoite - salivary gland - fructose feeding - immunoblotting
     Standard procedures for detecting salivary gland infections of malaria in mosquitoes rely
     either upon dissection followed by visualisation of sporozoites by light microscopy, or upon
     anti-sporozoite antibody reactions within a standard diagnostic assay (eg. ELISA), made against
     mosquito homogenates.</p>
    <p>An extremely simple method has been developed which detects salivary gland infections in live
     i mosquitoes. This method exploits the sugar feeding behaviour of the mosquito and utilises
     routine Western blotting techniques on nitrocellulose membrane. Infectivity of mosquitoes can
     be determined without the need for any direct manipulation of individuals. Female A, stephensi
     were infected with Plasmodium berghei, and after 14-16 days were starved of fructose overnight
     (12-18 h) then re-supplied with fructose through a small piece of nitrocellulose membrane laid
     on the cage. Mosquitoes were allowed to probe the membrane for several hours, then the membrane
     was removed and subjected to a standard immunoblotting protocol using an anti-P, berghei
     circumsporozoite protein (CSP) monoclonal antibody as the primary antibody.</p>
    <p>Sites where CSP was present on the membrane were visualised using horseradish peroxidase
     coupled to a secondary antibody.</p>
    <p>Nitrocellulose membranes from infected cages showed a variable number of very small black
     dots where individual mosquitoes had fed and deposited either CSP or sporozoites themselves. In
     contrast, membranes from cages of uninfected mosquitoes were free from these reaction sites.
     Positive reactivity against sporozoites was confirmed by coincidentally blotting dilution of
     homogenised salivary glands from infected and uninfected mosquitoes. The infectivity could be
     detected from 13-14 days after feeding and in as few as 27 mosquitoes at 19 days. After
     blocking in goat serum, blots could be stored in vacuum-sealed bags at 4 °C for at least 14
     weeks and still provide a positive reaction.</p>

     Insecticide - Resistance Members of the Simulium damnosum Theobald complex are best separated
     by cytotaxonomic methods based on the inversion and micromorphological differences on the
     larval salivary gland polytene chromosomes. This also permits the determination of hybrids and
     backcross progenies between the different cytospecies, when present, due to the non-pairing of
     homologous arms caused by the presence of the different diagnostic inversions. Backcross
     progenies of hybrid Simuliwn sanctipauli s.1./Simulium damnosum s.s. or Simulium sirbanum with
     either of the latter have been observed from various localities in sympatric situations and are

    <p>Recent progress in cdpepod systematics has refined the level of taxonomic resolution of these
     fresh water copepods and it is now know that Mesocyclops leuckarti does not occur in either
     Africa or India. There is therefore an obvious need to record these taxonomic changes and to
     review earlier records and update the nomenclature of these vectors wherever possible. This
     paper reviews all records of fresh water cyclopoia copepods from Nigeria, including those that
     act as vectors of qguinea worm and give their current name. A key is developed and given for
     identification of the genera Halicyclops, Macrocylops, Paracyclops, Ectocyclops, Tropocyclops,

    <p>CHROMOSOMAL VARIATION IN ÂANOPHÉLES GRMBIAE AND ECO-CLIMATIC FACTORS Istituto di
     Parassitologia, Università "La Sapienza", Roma, Italy.</p>
    <p>Malaria Vector studies in the Afrotropical region have involved in recent years routine
     cytotaxonomy of the sibling species of the Anopheles gambiae complex. More than 65,000 field
     collected specimens from some 1,000 different localities were scored for polytene chromosome
     analÿsis in our laboratory, Within such activity various cases of adaptive chromosomal
     variations were evidenced mostly through the comparative study of populations of the most
     anthropophilic member of the complex, namely An:gambiae ss.</p>
    <p>This taxon is closely associated to man all over its range of distribution which includes
     most of Africa south of the Sahara and extends from rain forest up to predesertic areas. Forest
     populations are monomorphic (or nearly so) for the standard chromosome-2 arrangement while
     savanna populations are differentiated by various inverted arrangements generally intergrading
     with the standard and increasing in their frequency towards drier savannas, Assuming a forest
     origin for the taxon, its adaptation to drier areas appears to be à process of polygenic
     reorganization for which paracentric inversions are the important selection units. Highly
     significant correlations are demonstrated between inversion frequencies and Variations in
     eco-climatic parameters along different transects from forest to dry savanna. The frequencies
     of arrangements 2Rb and 2La show the most striking correlation with degree of aridity at the
     sampling sites, New balanced polygenic systems with specific adaptive value for peculiar
     breeding conditions in savanna areas have been apparently developed by associations of various
     inverted chromosome-2 arrangements, The 2Rbec - 2La karyotype (known as the Mopti chromosomal
     form) constitutes a typical case of adaptation to arid savanna localities where larval breeding
     places, mostly produced bÿ irrigation, are available during the dry season.</p>

    <p>Vectors, Phlebotomine sandflies, taxonomy, computarization, computer aided identification The
     first step of the project is to realize an expert system for Computer Aided Iden- tification
     (CAI) of the Phlebotomine sandflies (Diptera, Psychodidae) of the five Andine countries
     (Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru and Venezuela). It is based on the previous work of the
     authors in French Guiana (Lebbe, Vignes &amp; Dedet, 1987).</p>
    <p>This collaborative multinational programme is coordinated and centralized at the Ins- tituto
     Boliviano de Biologia de Altura, La Paz (Bolivia).</p>
    <p>The programme is developped according to the following steps : . establishment of a data base
     for collection of bibliographic, nomenclatural (valid species) and biogeographical data, .
     establishment of a knowledge base of standardized descriptions of all species present in the
     countries. All data are collected using established forms.</p>
    <p>. programmation of requests on the data base and production of different lists.</p>
    <p>. automated translation in natural language of species descriptions.</p>
    <p>The data base will be used for production of synthetic documents (lists, etc...).</p>
    <p>The knowledge base of the sandfly description will allow us to product a CAI software for
     sanflies of the Andine region and the Guianas in three languages (English, French &amp;
     Spanish). It will consist in a computer diskette of PC format containing the CAI system
     accompanied by an illustrated user manual.</p>
    <p>This software will be used in all the concerned countries where different clinical types of
     leishmaniasis are endemic. It constitutes a prerequisite condition to develop- ment of control
     programs of leishmaniasis, and will be extended to the whole South and Fentral Amerirae 1131

    <p>Malaria vectors - chromosomal inversions - behaviour - laboratory experiments The patterns of
     chromosomal speciation and polymorphism shown by the Afrotropical mala- ria Vectors of the
     Anopheles gambiae complex point to paracentrie inversions as impor- tant selection units in a
     process of polygenic reorganization. Ecotypic divergences associated with chromosome-2
     inversion polymorphisms have been described in An.gambiae 5,s,, the most widespread and
     anthropophilic member of the complex (Coluzzi et al.,1979 1985), The hypothesis tested was that
     blood-fed females carriers of alternative arrange- ments for inversion 2La exhibit different
     physio-ethological responses to environmental conditions during their resting phase.
     Homokaryotypic strains were extracted from à polymorphie laboratory colony, established from
     adult females collected in Liberia in 1986, Homozygous 2L+ and 2La blood-fed females, bred
     simultaneously and marked with different fluorescent dusts, were allowed to distribute in a
     cylindrical apparatus divided transversally in two equal sized chambers (cmié&amp;xi4)
     separated by a sliding door.</p>
    <p>The experiments were carried out in a climatic room (T=28+1°C;RH=70+10%; photoperiod=i? hr);
     the mosquitoes were inserted in the apparatus 2 hours after the beginning of the scotophase and
     allowed to distribute for 18 hours, Light conditions were set as follows: A) complete darkness
     in both chambers; PB) upper chamber lit, The results show that the carriers of the two
     alternative arrangements exhibit different behavioural responses to these conditions. In the
     first case A) both homokaryotypes preferred the lower chamber and this positive geotaxis was
     more pronounced in the 2La strains (68% 2La vs 57% EL+; pti0"*), In the second case B),
     however, the carriers of the 2La homokaryotype were randomiy distributed over the two chambers,
     while most of the carriers of the 2L+ homokaryotype were recovered in the dark lower chamber
     (53% 2La vs 69% 2L+; p&lt;i07*) S10.A 11 P.+0 INTROGRESSION OF PARACENTRIC INVERSIONS BETWEEN

    <p>Malaria Vectors - chromosomes - evolution - introgressive hybridization Chromosomal changes
     due to paracentric inversions are an important genetic mechanism for ecotypic differentiation
     and speciation in the Anopheles gambiae complex, Polymorphic inversions are particularly common
     in An.gambise 5,5. and An.arsbiensis, the two most anthropophilie and widespread members of the
     complex“; three of these inversions, 2Rb 2Rc and 2La, appear to have exactly coincident
     break-points in the two taxa, The hypoth- esis of transfer of these rearrangements from one
     species to the other by introgressive hybridization via fertile hybrid females (Coluzzi et al.,
     1979) has been experimentally tested, The three strains used (and their polytene complement)
     were as follows: GAi- AR2-An.arabiensis (Xbced, 2Rb, 2La, 3Ra/+, 3L). The Fi female hybrids
     were back-crossed with males of either one or the other parental strain. Subsequent generations
     were then bred by mass cross and a sample of each generation, up to at least Fé, was scored for
     female polytene karyotypes, In all back-crosses the heterospecifie X chromosome was lost very
     rapidly (F3), Introgression of autosomal rearrangements has been shown only in the back-crosses
     of hybrid females with GAÏ males. The back-cross involving GALXARI hybrids produced a strain
     with the polytene sequence of the parental GAi, but with a stable 2La inversion polymorphism
     (2La frequency around 50%) acquired from ARi, AÀ similar result was obtained in the case of the
     back-cross with GAÏXAR2 hybrids: both 2Rb and 2La inversions were maintained in this case at a
     frequency higher than 30% These prelimi- nary results support the hypothesis that the primitive
     forest population of An.gambise, characterized by the standard chromosome-2 arrangement, was
     able to spread to drier saVannas, owing to the 2Rb and 2La inverted arrangements acquired from
     An.arabiensis, 1132 S 10.A - Identification des vecteurs et de leurs parasites.</p>

    <p>DNA probes, Loa loa, Chrysops Loa loa is a human filarial parasite which is transmitted by
     arthropod vectors of the genus Chrysops. The demonstration of infective larvae (L3) of L.loa in
     Chrysops ‘is currently possible only by laborious microscopic dissection of captured flies.
     This strategy is impracticable when hundreds of flies must be examined in order to provide
     reliable estimates of vector infection rates. The purpose of the study was to develop an
     alternative technique based on hybridization of DNA from infected Chrysops with a cloned L.loa
     DNA probe. À L.loa genomic Âeti1l library was screened with 32-P-labelled L.loa DNA and several
     clones containing repetitive DNA were identified, isolated, and their inserts subcloned in
     plasmid vectors. A recombinant plasmid pLL20 containing a 3.9 kb insert was characterized
     further. The cloned DNA contains repeat sequences which are absent from the genomes of Chrysops
     and humans. pLL20 could detect L.loa DNA equivalent to the DNA content of one L3 in the
     presence of a 300-750 fold excess of Chrysops DNA. Dot blot analysis of DNA isolated from
     Chrysops whose infection status had been determined a priori by microscopic dissection showed
     that pLLl20 could successfully identify infected vectors.</p>
    <p>With further refinements, pLL20 and other probes will be invaluable tools for epidemiological
     studies of loaiasis in Central and West Africa where the disease is endemic.</p>

    <p>Onchocerca - Simulium kilibanum - Burundi Dans le foyer de Rumonge, au Sud du Burundi, des

     éthanol pur, elles ont été colorées à l'hémalun acide de Mayer puis disséquées en glycérine. La
     présence d'un grand nombre de formes morphologiques intramusculaires en plus des formes du type
     Onchocerca indique une nette anthropo-zonphylie du vecteur. L'onchocercose bovine étant
     présente dans la région, et les dimensions des larves infectantes étant toutes comprises entre
     454 et 570 microns, nous les avons considérées globalement comme Onchocerca s.1.</p>
    <p>Toutes les valeurs sont en croissance sensible au cours du temps, en particulier le taux des
     mouches infectantes qui passe de 2 à 4 et le nombre moyen de larves infectantes par femelle
     infectante qui croît dans la même proportion. IL semble bien que cette situation soit liée
     d'une part au regroupement de la population rurale dispersée dans des centres importants situés
     dans la zone des vecteurs, et d'autre part aux activités humaines dans ces centres qui
     augmentent considérablement le contact homme-vecteur (marché hebdomadaire drainant les
     populations environnantes qui passent par les gîtes importants du vecteur, et la pêche avec
     vente du poisson aux heures d'activité maximale du vecteur là où il est abondant). Bien que la
     prévalence soit élevée (jusqu'à 70 %), la faible parasitémie semble indiquer que peu de larves
     infectantes appartiennent à O0. volvulus. L'évolution de la situation, sans intervention,
     constitue cependant un risque à longue échéance.</p>

     : urbain, suburbain, périurbain. Dans cha- que zone, les effectifs de tiques présumés peuvent
     être appréhendés si l'on connaît le nombre d'hôtes (chiens) et l'aptitude écologique de la zone
     à héberger des tiques. Le nombre de chiens est obtenu par sondage (150 logements dans un
     quartier représentatif de la zone). L'aptitude à abriter des populations de tiques est estimée
     par l'étude du parasitisme canin (fréquence, intensité du parasitisme : examen de 300 chiens).
     Une étude complémentaire vise à définir le caractère plus ou moins favorable des divers
     biotopes. C'est le périurbain qui recèle le plus de chiens et qui présente la fréquence de
     parasitisme la plus élevée.Le suburbain recè le moins de chiens, à fréquence de parasitisme
     moindre mais souvent hyper- parasités. L'urbain est le moins riche en chiens et en parasites.
     La mai- son individuelle avec jardin est le biotope le plus favorable. L'espace collectif

     l’effet d’une lutte antiVectorielle limitée à ces populations. Cependant, la découverte en
     février 1988 de 18 cas de maladie du sommeil dans un village (Kingoye, région du Pool) ne
     présentant pas de glossines pé- ridomestiques, met en avant le rôle des populations de
     G.palpalis “sauvages”. Celles- ci, en l'absence d’hôte domestique et à cause de la rareté du
     gibier, peuvent être en contact très étroit avec les populations humaines au niveau des champs
     et des points de rouissage du manioc, parfois très éloignés du village. On a donc entrepris de
     cartographier les principales zones d’activité agricole des villageois de Kingoye ainsi que
     tous les points de contact homme/tsé-tsé. L'examen des itinéraires de 14 malades a permis de
     déterminer une zone de contamination probable où devrait s’effectuer en priorité la lutte

     ce qui est en général admis pour les foyers du Niari, ce qui complique singulièrement le

    <p>Isozymes, Markers, Distinguished, Sexual dimorphism, Inversion The development analysis of
     isozymes by the application of electrophoretic technique is à new approach to the problems of
     systematics. Alkaline phosphatase (APH) and Acid Phosphatase (ACPH) isozymes have been used as
     markers to study the deve- lopmental events in wild type and black mutant of Anopheles
     stephensi,. The wild type and the black mutant of A.stephensi are distinctly distinguished for
     the first time on the basis of APH and ACPH isozyme pattern. Further, each developmental stage
     is clearly identified by the number of isozymes, activity of APH and ACPH, Sexual dimorphism is
     also observed in the wild type and black mutant A.stephensi, However the wild type and mutant
     of A.stephensi are not differentiated cytologically based on the inversion study. The
     developmental phosphatase isozymes (APH and ACPH) have been classified into two categories and
     their biological functions are exemplified.</p>

    <p>DNA FINGERPRINTING IN THE SNAIL BULINUS.</p>

     Biologie, Montpellier, FRANCE Bulinus, mating systems, DNA fingerprinting, population genetics
     Mating systems are as diverse in molluscs as in plants. Bulinus, the intermediate host of
     Schistosoma in Africa, is a self-fertile hermaphro- dite. However, it cross-fertilizes when
     paired. Foreign is stored and remains viable for several months after copulation. Moreover, in
     B. trun- catus, a variable number of snails per population is aphallic.</p>
    <p>Our work focused on the evolution of natural populations in relation to mating systems,
     particularly the role of self- versus cross-fertili- zation, the incidence of multiple
     copulations and the origin and mainte- nance of aphally. Thus, genetic markers are required. As
     the electropho- retic variability is low in Bulinus, we used minisatellite DNA (finger-
     printing).</p>
    <p>Recent works have shown that human minisatellites DNA probes could hybridize with a wide
     variety of animal and plant DNA. We show here that they can also be used in Bulinus for which
     DNA fingerprints were obtai- ned. The analysis of selfed and outcrossed offspring have shown
     that these markers are inherited in a standart mendelian fashion. They are then suitable to
     investigate mating systems.</p>

    <p>Institute of zoology and parazitology, Tashkent, 700095, A.Nyasova 1 To investigate the
     peculiarities of life cycles of helminths and to re- veal the laws of invasion circulation in
     nature in 1980-1989 years we researched more than 15.000 arthropods and 3.400 molluscs for
     spontane- ous infection by larvae of parasitic worms. For defining the larvae of helmints we
     used the works of A.Chabaud, V.M.Ivashkin and others, 83 spp.</p>
    <p>of helminths larvae were found in arthropods, 11 SPPe in molluscs. Spe- cific composition of
     helminths is most various (47/! in insects of Cole- optera. Extensiveness of their infection is
     also high and makes at Tene- brionidae 14,3%, Scarabaeidae - 10,8%, Carabidae - Sen, About 5
     spp. Of helminths parasitize on one insect. One specific (41,2%), two specific (30,6%) end
     three specific (15,4%) compositions prevail. Molluscs are less infected (1,8-3,9%) by helminths
     (trematodes, nematodes), but they have distinctly expressed nidus. The cycle of these
     helminths' develop- includes water hosts among reptiles, mammals and is characterised by more
     extensive biocenotic links. Due to great numbers and high extensi veness of invasion the
     insects promote intensive exchange of invasion among various species of birds, mammals,
     reptiles. However, there are species of insects, which are "ecological deadlock" for some
     species Spirurata. As a result, the ways of invasion circulation in biocenosis are determined.
     Ecological factors, stipulating synchronism in develop- ment of helminths and their
     intermediate hosts are revealed.</p>

    <p>Leishmania aethiopica, DNA probe, insect vector Field surveys were carried out in an area
     hyperendemic for cutaneous leishmaniasis in South-West Ethiopia to evaluate our DNA probes for
     detecting Leishmania aethiopica in naturally infected sandflies. A total of 495 female
     sandflies were collected, dissected and examined under the microscope for the presence of
     intestinal flagellates. Five sandflies were found to be infected. Flogellates from infected
     sandflies were cultured and proved to be L. aethiopica by ioenzyme typing. The guts of all
     examined sandflies were applied to nylon membrane and hybridized with DNA probes. Hybridi-
     zation with total kDNA as well as with a cloned L. aethiopica-specific DNA probe was positive
     for all specimens found infected by microscopy. In another experiment 89 female sandflies
     collected on human bait were divided into two groups. One was dissected and examined
     microscopically: the infection rate was 5.6%. Sandflies of the other group were crushed onto
     hybridization membrane: hybridization with DNA probes was positive in 6.1%. Our results
     demonstrate that DNA probes are useful tools to detect Leishmania infection in vectors. This
     technique may replace the tedious dissection used in large scale epidemiological studies.</p>

    <p>Artificial vision techniques are planned to be used for automatic identification of insect
     vectors. They need plan objects, easily observable without preparation, and even- tually
     observable on living specimens. According to these criteria, we choose phleboto- mine sandfly
     wings, of which venation topology is constant.</p>
    <p>The preliminary study interests a reduced number of well sampled species, in order to compare
     intra- and inter-specific morphometric variations. Discriminant characters were searched for
     (distances, distance ratios, surfaces, etc...), by linear discriminant analysis and machine
     learning techniques.</p>
    <p>The measures are realized through a microscope equiped with a camera lucida projec- ting its
     image on a graphic table. À programme for imput of the normalized cartesian coordinates of the
     vein intersections is developped.</p>
    <p>The efficiency of the system has been evaluated and showed that it was possible to measure
     more than 50 wings per hour with a best than 5 % precision. The first results obtained showed
     that wing morphometry permit to easily distinguish the majority of the species tested.</p>
    <p>À large scale extension of this study is developped in order to appreciate its effective
     discriminant power on the total fauna of a country. This step is necessary before reaching the

    <p>Anopheles stephensi - ATPase - Midgut - Water regulation Rapid post-feeding water regulation
     is an essential physiological function of the midgut and Malpighian tubule epithelia in
     mosquitoes. In higher Diptera, membrane-bound ATPases are involved in water regulation in the
     midgut, and therefore provide interesting target sites for novel control strategies. This study
     was initiated in order to identify, characterise and localise ATPase enzymes in the midgut of
     the malaria mosquito Anopheles stephensi, Adult female mosquitoes were collected during or just
     after engorgement on an anaesthetised rat. Mosquitoes were immediately placed on ice and
     midguts dissected in 0.05 M Tris buffer, pH 7.4. A micro-assay suitable for mosquito tissue was
     developed, with ATPase activity detectable in 0.2 midgut equivalents. Release of activity was
     relatively low in crudely homogenised tissue preparations,but was improved by homogenisation
     with "Tween" detergent and by sonication for 15 s on ice. Differential centrifugation allowed
     for separation of a putative microsomal fraction at 100,000 gfor 2h.</p>
    <p>In crude midgut homogenates, ATPase activity was found to be optimal in the presence of
     Mg2+,Na+ and K+ ions, and was reduced in the absence of either or both Na+ and K+ ions.</p>
    <p>Activity was significantly inhibited in the presence of 1mM ouabain. The results clearly
     indicate the presence of an ATPase, thought to be a Nat-K+-ATPase, in À, stephensi midgut
     tissue.</p>
    <p>Further study will involve full characterisation of the principle enzyme, and its
     localisation using immunohistochemical and electron microscopical techniques. The temporal
     fluctuations in Na+-K+-ATPase activity will be examined, particularly during the immediate
     post-feeding period.</p>
    <p>Studies with specific inhibitors and with antibodies will further indicate potential target
     sites for disruption of midgut function.</p>

     tsetse were then dissected. Infection rates were as follows: 0-97% for T. vivax, 0.3-49% for T.
     congolense and 0-40% for T. b. brucei.</p>
    <p>Survival of Kenyan T. vivax was best in G. brevipalpis (97%), poorest in G. austeni (2%) and
     the four palpalis group tsetse (range, O0-1.3%), with G. m. centralis intermediate (61%). For
     Nigerian T. vivax the infection rates were quite high in all 7 tsetse used (range, 71-97%).
     Survival of both Tanzanian and Nigerian T. congolense was best in G. m. centralis (35%, 49%),
     poorest in G. austeni (2%, 3%) and the four palpalis group tsetse (range, 0.3-6%), with G.

    <p>Survival of both Tanzanian and Nigerian T. b. brucei was good in G. m. centralis (40%, 7%)
     but low in the other tsetse species (range, 0-2%). It would appear therefore that full cyclical
     development of T. vivax, T. congolense and T. b. brucei involves a complex interaction between
     certain biological properties of the trypanosome population taken with a bloodmeal and some

     Anopheles The polymerase Chain reaction (PCR) was used to seperate wild-caught females of the
     Anopheles qambiae ccmplex. DNA fragments of species diagnostic length were amplified in two
     reactions from small amounts of genomic DNA with PCR primer based on ribosomal DNA (rDNA)
     sequences. The first reaction was a 3 primer ccmbination of a universal plus strand primer (A)
     derived from a conserved region at dei en of the 28S rDNA coding region and 2 species-specific
     minus strand primers (Aa and à) derived from sequences in the intergenic spacers (IGS),
     approximately O.5kb and 1.3kb downstream of À respectively. PCR amplification of mosquito DNA
     produces a O.5kb or a 1.3kb diagnostic fragment if A. arabiensis or À. gambiae DNA is used as
     template. The second reaction was a 2 primer combination of a universal plus strand primer
     derived from a conserved region at the 3 end of the 5.8S coding region and a universal minus
     strand primer derived from a conserved region at the 5 end of the 18S coding region about
     0.85kb downstream of the first. PCR amplification produces a ron-specific 0.85kb fragment if
     DNA frem any of the A. gambiae complex is used as template. The reaction products were
     visualized on ethidium brcmide-stained agarose gel. Gencmic DNA of fielc collected specimens

    <p>Parasite associations-Schistosoma bovis-S. haematobium-Bulinus truncatus-Cercarial shedding
     pattern.</p>
    <p>Parasite associations cause difficult problems to arise in epidemiology when two closely
     related parasites develop in a single vector. In schistosomes, the larval stages, mainly
     cercariae, are so similar morphologically that the natural multiple infections are often
     masked. Our aim was to ascertain whether the patterns of cercarial emergence can be used to
     identify mixed infections. We used Schistosoma bovis and S. haematobium which develop in the
     same intermediate host Bulinus truncatus. The cercarial emergence patterns were analysed hourly
     using a cercariometric apparatus.</p>
    <p>In single infections the two species displayed diurnal but distinctive cercarial sheddings.
     There was a rapid increase in the number of emitted cercariae with an average emergence peak
     which occured at 8 a.m. for S.</p>
    <p>bovis and 11 a.m./ midday for S. haematobium; then, the cercarial emergence decreased
     steadily for the next 8 hours and ceased at about 7 p.m. in both species. In double infections,
     each species kept its own cercarial shedding rhythm with no marked alterations.</p>
    <p>The cercarial shedding pattern is suggested for the detection of parasite associations as an
     alternative method to cercarial chaetotaxy and isoenzyme analysis.</p>

     Sverdlovsk, USSR Mosquitoes - Population spatial structure Long-term study was conducted on
     structural and functional organizati- on of Aedes communis De Geer population in the valley of
     the Khadyta River, south Yamal. Only a half of the insular flood-plain forest ter- ritory
     contained water bodies inhabited by mosquitoes. Model plots were used to estimate the density
     and numbers of mature larvae and bi- ting females. Due to instability of inundation regime the
     number of mosquitoes emerging from each water body (micropopulation) varied by years 3-30
     times. The numbers were more constant for wooded segments squared from 5 to 100 ha ( avg. 28,5
     ha); these are intrapopulation groups with high frequency of panmixia. One of such groups at
     the plot of 13 ha numbered 263,1-862,9 thousand individuals. According to the patterns of
     forest vegetation distribution and features of mosqui- to phenology the groups mentioned were
     joined into the larger struc- tures - subpopulations. The whole population, occupying 7887 ha,
     con- tained 9 subpopulations: in upper, middle and lower streams of Khady- ta, and along its
     tributaries. Each of those subpopulations consisted of 8-128 groups (the total being about 380
     items). The most abundant subpopulation inhabiting the middle stream of Khadyta enumerated from
     32,4 to 123,4 million mosquitoes. The intensity of female exchange between different population
     subdivisions varied considerably by the years being dependent upon weather conditions.</p>

     VÉCTCR ILENTIFICATION USING THE CUTICULAR HYDROCARBONS Phiilips, À., Milligen, P., Broomfield,
     G., Molÿneux, U.H. Department of Biological Sciences, University of Salford, U.K. | Vector
     identification; cuticular hydrocarbon analysis; sibling species; Diptera.</p>
    <p>Of the biochemical methods currently available for vector identification, cuticular
     hydrocarbon analysis was specifically developed for adult identification and utilises the
     cuticular hydrocarbons removed by solvent extraction from the wax layer. Gas chromatography is
     used to separate the cuticular hydrocarbons while statistical analysis of the data assists
     interpretation of results.</p>
    <p>In part, cuticular hydrocarbons function in waterproofing insects, but many hydrocarbons have
     roles in chemical communication. Precisely controlled amounts of these hydrocarbons are present
     in the wax layer which optimise their semiochemical function. Similarly, the separation of
     sibling species using differences in cuticular hydrocarbon profiles fully exploits the
     precision with which certain hydrocarbons are produced and expressed in the cuticular wax. It
     is possible that these species specific hydrocarbons also have a semiochemical function perhaps
     in mate recognition. Our studies on Anopheles gambiae s.str. and in particular the chromosomal
     forms of this species (in collaboration with Prof M Coluzzi) provide evidence for a mate
     recognition function.</p>
    <p>In spite of our limited knowledge of the function of these species specific hydrocarbons,
     they provide us with an accurate method of species determination which, in addition, has the
     capability of detecting developing species. Cuticular hydrocarbon analysis has been applied to
     study species complexes in the following genera; Anopheles, Aedes, Culex, Phlebotomus,
     Psychodopyqus, Lutzomyia, Simulium.</p>
    <p>The potential of cuticular hydrocarbon analysis in the identification of sibling species has
     thus been established.</p>

     cutaneous leishmaniasis has been found at the periphery of the Central Salt Desert in
     Abardej,Varamin which is situated only 70 Km. south east of Teheran. As this area is under
     development with new system of irrigation,we decided to determine reservoir,vector and the
     prevalence of disease among inhabitants of villages around this focus.</p>
    <p>Four sites were selected for collecting rodents and sandflies,Collection and dissection of
     sandflies were made weekly during May-0ctober 1989,Fifteen schools were visited once in the
     last quarter of 1989 and 3740 students were questioned and examined to determine the prevalence
     of disease, Reservoir;kecollected wild rodents fromtle colonies,they were consisted of 15
     Rhombomys vpimus and one Meriones.Direct examination of smears prepared from the edges of the
     ears showed leishmania parasite in 11(70%)Rhombomys opimus.</p>
    <p>Vector;A total of 850 sandflies were dissected and out of 437 Ph.papatasi and 413
     S.sintoni,20 (4.5#%) and 31(7.5%) had leptomonad infection respectively.It was also concluded
     that natural leptomonad infection of Ph.papatasi in rodent burrows of this area starts in
     mid-June and continues until mid-September and it has two peaks;in late June (9%) and early
     September (7.54).</p>
    <p>Human infection; No active lesions nor scurs were seen in Abardej and gther villages in
     southern Teheran, the absence of human cases seems to be the remote- ness of human dwellings

    <p>The development of Onchocerca volvulus in the Cayapa and Aguarico vector cytospecies of the
     Simulium exiguum complex was compared with its development in the Quevedo and Bucay cytospecies
     that occur outside the onchocerciasis focus in Ecuador.</p>
    <p>Cytospecies identification was based on an examination of polytene chromosomes of larvae
     collected from rivers at the two sites within the disease focus and at two in non-endemic
     areas. The four sites selected for the study each contained a single cytospecies of the S.
     exiguum complex. Adult flies from each site were collected and blood fed from the same infected
     volunteer and then dissected for filariae seven days after the infective blood meal.</p>
    <p>Synchronous parasite development to the Ls stage occurred in all four cytospecies, but their
     host capacities to the parasite varied. Although in all cases between 20.0-28.6% of all the
     microfilariae ingested developed to L; larvae, mean microfilarial îintake, mean La production
     and % infection rates varied. The Cayapa cytospecies was the most efficient host with a high
     proportion of flies becoming infected from an average microfilarial intake per fly of 3.4; the
     Aguarico cytospecies probably has a similar level of host capacity. Of the two non vectors, the
     Bucay was a more efficient host than the Quevedo cytospecies, but both were less efficient than
     the two vector cytospecies showing lower microfilarial ingestion rates and L,; loads.</p>
    <p>The implications of these results for the future dispersal of onchocerciasis in Ecuador are
     discussed.</p>

    <p>Chez A. atroparvus, il existe un polymorphisme des oeufs pouvant être très important: le
     pourcentage d'oeufs tachés, donc typiques, varie de 35 à 98 pour une ponte donnée.</p>
    <p>Le critère soies antépalmées, s'il est utilisé seul, permet de déterminer entre 40 % et 70 %
     des souches d'A. atroparvus, et 40 % des souches de A. maculipennis (typicus).</p>
    <p>L'étude de 7 paramètres alaires par une analyse multidiscriminante montre que la lon- gueur
     des ailes est liée à l'espèce, A. atroparvus est bien un moustique à "ailes cour- tes", tandis
     que A. maculipennis et A. melanoon sont des moustiques à "ailes longues".</p>
    <p>L'étude des systèmes gène-enzymes montre que le caractère très fluctuant de la chéto- taxie
     d'A. atroparvus est dû à des variations géographiques très importantes. Elle ne met pas en
     évidence l'existence d'hybrides entre les différentes espèces jumelles, mais elle confirme la

    <p>P+0 Leishmania, in situ hybridization, PCR, vector.</p>
    <p>In situ hybridization (ISH) and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays have been evalu- ated
     for detection and identification of Leishmania. Both detection methods were tested on cultured
     promastigotes and on infected sandflies. For the ISH total, nuclear and kinetoplast DNA probes
     were used. Total DNA probes provided a strong signal, outstanding configuration but low
     specificity. Of the nuclear probes only repeated sequeïces gave a distinct signal.</p>
    <p>kDNA probes provided a high specificity, but their application required a completely clear
     background and some preservation of the morphology. The background caused considerable pro-
     blems in smears of sandflies. It was solved by the use of the Digene detection kit. With this
     kit labeled kDNA minicircle probes offers the best possibility of simultaneous detection
     (morphology) and characterization (kDNA probe) of Leishmania in sandflies in an assay that
     takes about three hours. Oligonucleotides primers derived from single copy genes, ribosomal RNA
     (rRNA) and minicircle kDNA were tested in PCR. Single copy gene primers did not detect less
     than 1000 cultured promastigotes. Primers derived from kDNA sequences (conserved and specific)
     allowed detection of about 50 promastigotes. However, the differences in sequence of the
     specific primers within taxa resulted in a specificity that limited the applicability to
     detection within (often small) geographical areas. Sequencing of rRNA of 10 different
     Leishmania taxa showed an almost complete homology for the 16S rRNA. Primers based on this
     sequence can differentiate between Leishmania and closely related species such as Trypanosoma
     vut can not differentiate between Leishmania taxa. Thus, both ISH and PCR can be used for
     ädetection/identification of Leishmania. ISH has the advantage that it can be performed with
     routine equipment on smears of sandflies. Microscopy and dissection will still be time
     consuming. PCR is still experimetal but a combination of rRNA and kDNA probes 1ooks ü ré
     promising.</p>

    <p>The keys are the identification device the most commonly used. Their creation is difficult
     and time consuming, and the evolution of scientific knowledges, such as the descriptions of new
     species, necessitates to rewrite them regularly.</p>
    <p>The microcomputer rapid extension and the improvements in the key generation program- mes
     since the seventies, permit to the taxonomists to use commonly these techniques.</p>
    <p>The MAKEY programme for key generation was developped using knowledge bases of the XPER
     format. This key generator was applied to the knowledge base of French Guiana sand- flies
     (Lebbe, Vignes &amp; Dedet, 1987) in order to provide different keys corresponding to the
     various needs. The algorithm used succeeds in generating keys shorter than the man: ual ones,
     and various parameters garanteeze the preferential use of easily observable characters.</p>
    <p>Apart the advantage in key generation, this programme ensures a perfect consistency between
     the species descriptions and the resulting keys, something difficult to warrant in the case of
     keys manually realized.</p>
    <p>The successful achievement of automatically generated keys for French Guiana sand- flies
     allows us to plan regular updates of the keys and their extension to South Ameri- can

     these pyrethroids against tsetse flies. The flies were released in a fly proof stable and
     allowed to feed on a treated oxen. The subsequent effects in terms of increased mortality,
     paralysis and its duration were recorded. The results of the previous trials allowed to
     conceive a strategy against tsetse in an area of a high incidence of African Animal
     Trÿypanosomosis (AAT). Starting in November 1987, three subsequent treatments with Flumethrin
     at monthly intervals resulted in a significant decrease in the incidence of AAT, 9 further
     treatments with Flumethrin until November 1988 reduced the infection rates to values below 5 %.
     During 1989 the cattle population was treated only 5 times, 2 barriers against reinvasion were
     established and the incidence of AAT further monitored. It appears now that the infection rate

     Fleas irritate animals and man and flea allergy dermatitis is an important, prevalent disease
     in dogs and cats world-wide. Ctenocephalides felis felis is the most common species of flea and
     is found on many animals yet its host specificity, survival rate and fecundity on various hosts
     has not been studied in detail. We studied the ability of various hosts to support the flea and
     the skin reactivity of the host to the flea.</p>
    <p>Fleas were allowed to feed for 15 minutes on dogs, cats, sheep, rats and humans. Guts
     dissected from the fleas were examined microscopically to establish efficiency of feeding. An
     average of 46% of fleas fed on sheep, 61% on humans, 80% on rats whereas 86-88% fed on cats and
     dogs. Survival and fecundity of fleas was also higher on cats than sheep. Skin reactivity to
     various flea antigens was tested in animals either infested with fleas or sensitised with
     intracutaneous injections of flea antigens.</p>
    <p>Repeated injection of salivary gland extracts induced significant immediate hyper-
     sensitivity in Sheep. Sheep sensitised to these extracts did not react to feeding fleas and the
     numbers of fleas which fed on these sheep did not differ from those which fed on non-sensitised

    <p>Teratocytes-Braconidae-Lepidoptera-Development-Proteins Teratocytes are cells derived from
     the serosa of some hymenopteran parasitoids which develop freely in the insect host's
     hemolymph. The model used here is the parasitoid braconid wasp Cotesia congregata and its host,
     larvae of the tobacco hornworm, Manduca sexta. Interactions of the parasitoid larvae, the
     teratocytes, and the host are not yet well-defined, although different roles for the
     teratocytes have been suggested in other species. The morphological development and
     ultrastructure of teratocytes were studied using scanning and transmission electron microscopy.
     Cells of all stages have a dense layer of microvilli on their surface, with vesicles appearing
     at one specific stage of their development; our observations suggest they have both absorptive
     and secretory roles during development of the wasps. In vitro cultures were carried out using
     35$ methionine. The culture medium and cellular proteins were analyzed using SDS-PAGE gels and
     autoradiography, and a radioanalytic imaging AMBIS system. New proteins were secreted into the
     medium at the same time that vesicles appeared on the surrace of teratocytes. These events were
     temporally correlated with the first larval molt of the parasitoids, 2 to 3 days before the
     wasps underwent emergence from the host. Supported by grants from the NSF, USDA, and American

     are the main intermediate hosts of hymenolepidids of ducks in Kazakhstan. They inhabit
     freswater and slightly salt reservoirs and are well adapted tu various conditi- ons, They
     easily stand drying up of reservoirs, passively spread as cysts, are ice - found, and after
     snow has come off they return to life and cause infection of the birds with hymenolepidosis,
     Mass infec- tion everywhere in Kazakhstan is observed in summer, from 3 % in lar- ge reservoirs
     to 30 % in ponds and small isolated pools, During winter months se early spring when ice
     disappears, infection is reduced to I - 1,5 %.</p>
    <p>Main accumulations of infected shrimps are observed in the litto- ral zone at a depth of 7 -
     IO cm, in the areas with aguatic plants: Pemphigus vulgaris, Lemne L., Algas filamentum,
     Ceratophillum IL, Crustacea are very sensitive to changes of water temperature. The most
     favourable water temperature in I8 - 20°C, and that of silt - 24- 26°C, In the evening and
     night-time plenty of crustacea are seen in the pelagis zone with small rushy aveas attracting a

    <p>EFFECT OF HYMENOLEPIS DIMINUTA AND OTHER FACTORS ON THE COPROPHAGIC ACTIVITY OF TRIBOLIUM
     CONFUSUM IN AN OPEN FIELD W.S. Evans, M.C. Hardy Eine) Fresh: -Dppartment of Biology,
     University of Winnipeg, Tribolium confusum, Hymenolepis diminuta, selective coprophagy, pen
     field Groups of Tribolium confusum, randomly selected from stock cultures were starved for 48
     h, separated into groups of 10 beetles each and placed in circular open fields (dia. 9 cm.).
     Each field contained two infec- tive fecal baits (from rats infected with patent Hymenolepis
     diminuta) and two non-infective baits (from uninfected rats). Bait types were placed
     equidistant from each other in an alternating sequence around the periphery of the field.
     Beetles were allowed to forage for 2 h and the number in the region of each bait was recorded
     every 20 minutes until the experiments were terminated. The beetles were strongly attracted by
     the baits as the portion of the population located in the fecal re- gions increased from 58% at
     the first observation time (20 minutes) to 80% at 120 min. At all but the first observation
     time they consistantly displayed a significant preference (p &lt; 0.05) for feces from infected
     rats. Similar results were obtained when the number of beetles per field was reduced to 5.
     Results from experiments with only 1 beetle per field suggested that foraging activity was
     influenced by a group effect as fewer beetles accumulated in the fecal regions and preference
     for in- fective baits was significant (p &lt; 0.05) only at 120 min. Foraging was also effected
     by the number of baits available. In fields with only 1 bait of each type, a preference for
     infective feces was evident but beetles accumulated in the bait regions more gradually than
     those in fields that contained 2 baits of each type.</p>

    <p>EPIDEMIOLOGY OF IXODID TICKS IN INDIA S.K. Gupta Department of Vety. Parasitology, H.A.U.
     HISAR-125004 INDIA Epidemiology - Ixodid Ticks Ticks and tick-borne diseases have assumed
     enormous significance as major obstacles to the development of livestock industry in India. The
     tropical climate is suitable for the preponderance of ticks. Nearly 55 species belonging to 8
     genera have been recorded from different livestock hosts. Hyalomma anatolicum anatolicum is
     perhaps the most common tick entity of domestic animals occuring thoughout India except in the
     north-east.</p>
    <p>Boophilus microplus is the other predominant tick occuring mainly on cattle and buffaloes but
     more widespread and year-round in occurrence. Haemaphysalis has many species, some of them are
     predominant in hilly areas. Rhipicephalus spp. are less common on livestock animals. Nosomma
     monstrosum is restricted in location and host. Ticks of other genera viz., Ixodes, Amblyomma
     and Dermacentor are confined to some hilly areas. Hyalomma dromedarii is predominant in camels.
     Boophilus annulatus and B. decoloratus are restricted to coastal and hilly regions. In the
     humid, irrigated regions B. microplus predominates while in the semi-arid to arid regions with
     limited irrigation facilities Hyalomma spp. are more common. Flag dragging has yielded mainly
     larvae of B. microplus, H. a. anatolicum and Haemaphysalis spp. These epidemiological studies
     will be helpful in formulating effective control strategies against ticks.</p>

    <p>La présente étude a été réalisée dans un foyer de bilharziose uro-genitale dans la plaine du
     Haouz (Attaouia), zone aride alimentée d'un grand réseau d'irrigation. Chaque mois, durant une
     année, les auteurs ont détérminé la répartition spaciale et les fluctuations temporelles des
     populations de Bulinus truncatus par la méthode de dragage au niveau des canaux d'irrigation.
     Les populations de Bulinus étaient très abondantes à la fin du printemps et à la fin de l'été.
     Ces mollusques se reproduisaient durant toute l'année, mais la première moitié du printemps
     était la période pendant laquelle les Bulins présentaient une importante activité de ponte.</p>

    <p>Snail-Trematode interactions; snail hemocytes,; Biomphalaria glabrata.</p>
    <p>Hemocytes production in B.glabrata takes place in an ‘hemopoietic'' organ (HPO) located in
     the pericardial wall, near the mantle cavity. Resistant or partially resistant snails respond
     to exposure to the Trematode Echinostoma caproni by hemocytes multiplication,but no reaction
     occurs in susceptible snails exposed to E.caproni or to Schistosoma mansoni.</p>
    <p>In stimulated or hypertrophic organs, young hemocytes formed in proliferative nodules, leave
     HPO through blood sinuses and are able to divide further. They have an homogenous cytoplasm
     with few organelles and numerous free ribosomes and they seem rather immature compared to
     hemocytes collected from hemolymph. Fully mature hemocytes comprise two types of larger cells
     characterized by: - a thick ectoplasm devoid of organelles and forming pseudopods and
     superficial vacuoles; - an endoplasmic region with various orga- nelies and secretory vesicles.
     Type 4 cells contain large glycogen deposits which are almost absent in type 3 cells; a few
     smaller cells form an heterogenous population.</p>
    <p>We observed that hemocytes accumulate in wide hemal spaces of the proximal region of the
     kidney which is involved in hemolymph ultrafiltration and receives an important arterial
     supply. Absent in control snails, these accumulations seem limited and transient in resistant
     snails; they are more conspicuous and permanent in partially resistant snails or in snails
     harbouring old Trematode infections.</p>
    <p>The proximal part of the kidney plays a role in the snail internal defense as a site where
     young hemocytes can complete differenciation when trapped in the meshes of loose connective
     tissue; furthermore numerous fixed phagocytes ingest waste or foreign cells or substances.</p>

    <p>Biological control - Cercarial production - Non-vector molluscs - Schistosomes - Transmission
     Vector and non-vector molluscs often coexist in the transmission sites of schistosomiasis. We
     carried out an experimental study to analyse the influence of non-vector molluscs on the
     cercarial production of schistosomes and on the growth of vector molluscs. We used the
     host-parasite system Bulinus wrighti - Schistosoma bovis and the non- vector mollusc Melanopsis
     praemorsa.</p>
    <p>The results indicated that M. praemorsa determined a significative enhancing of the $, bovis
     cercarial production and provoked a stimulation of the growth of B, wrighti. The stimulation of
     the growth of the vector mollusc was apparently the only factor responsible for the enhanced
     cercarial production of the parasite; there was no evidence of a direct influence of the
     non-vector mollusc upon the development of the cercarial production of the schistosome.</p>
    <p>Such experimental results need to be confirmed in field conditions to make sure they do not
     counterbalance, or even nullify, the benefits obtained through biological control using the
     introduction of non-vector molluscs in transmission sites.</p>

     of natural tick resistance levels of taurine (Bos taurus) and zebuine (Bos indicus) cattle upon
     the attachment of larvae, nymphs and adults of Boophilus microplus, upon the engorging of its
     females and also upon the egg laying capacity of such females and the fertility of their eggs.
     The results showed that the average daily number of each o these stages and the average drops
     of engorged tick females was around 15 times as large in the taurine hosts as in the zebuine
     ones. Females maturing in the taurine were significantly heavier, layed larger numbers of eggs
     and these had higher hatching percentages than the ones coming from zebuine hosts.</p>
    <p>It become evident that this larger average number of eggs and this higher average of egg
     hatching percentage when they came from female ticks engorging in taurine hosts were due to the
     average larger weight of such females as compared to the weight of the ones engorging in
     zebuine hosts. In fact, when tick females of similar weights from both taurine or zebuine hosts
     were compared no significant differences were found between them either in egg laying capacity
     or in egg hatchability. In other words, if the zebuine hosts drop much smaller numbers of less
     engorged tick females in the pastures, they still are important sources of fertile eggs which
     may hatch dangerous numbers of infective larval.</p>

     Moravec. Institute of Parasitology, Czechoslovak Academy of Sciences, Branisovské 31, 370 05
     Ceské Budèjovice, Czechoslovakia Allocreadium isoporum - bionomy - chub - Ephemera Present
     knowledge of the biology and ecology of the fish trematode Allocreadium isoporum (Looss, 1894)
     is rather poor. Therefore, in the years 1985-87, the bionomy of this parasite was followed in
     the River Rokytné, Czechoslovakia. While clams of the genera Sphaerium and Pisidium serve
     apparently as its first intermediate hosts, mayfly larvae Ephemera danica were found
     (prevalence 8%, intensity 1-5 metacercariae per mayfly) to be the only second intermediate host
     of A. isoporum in the locality.</p>
    <p>The most important definitive host is chub, Leuciscus cephalus, in which seasonal dynamics of
     A. isoporum occurrence and maturation was followed.</p>
    <p>Prevalence (73%) and intensity (3-37 trematodes per fish) of infection in this fish were high
     all year, with both abiotic and biotic factors influ- encing the fluctuations. The trematode
     exhibits here a distinct seasonal cycle of maturation manifested mainly quantitatively.
     Trematodes with eggs occur almost all the year round, but mainly in spring and early summer
     (maximum in May). New infections in chub occur throughout the year, this periodicity being
     controlled by ecological factors, mainly temperature régime in the locality. A. isoporum
     infections in chub depend on the body size of host fishes; the highest degree of A. isoporum
     infection occurs in the size group of fishes 20-25 cm long, the values of prevalence somewhat
     decreasing in larger fishes; it is associated with changes in the food composition of chub of
     different size groups.</p>

    <p>Ticks - Transmembrane shuttle - Lipoprotein- vaccine Many tick species have evolved to
     survive long periods off host, taking advantage of niches with widely distributed hosts.
     Electron microscope ultrastructure and histochemical studies of starved Heamaphysalis punctata
     indicate the lowest energy reserves are attained on host attachment. Midgut epitheriai cells
     exhibit intra and extra cellular stalked structures anchored to apical membrane. These
     structures are observed throughout the first digestive phase, in close intracellular
     association with mitocondria. Image’ averaging of the 7-9nm head portion, reveal several
     hydrophobic domains. These features are present in "High Density Lipoprotein'. It is postulated
     that during inital feeding, host triglycerides are utilised via ‘Transmembrane Lipid Shuttle'
     for vital metabolic energy. Shuttle protein epitopes presented, as early stage concealed
     antigen with or without feeding deterents may have implications for tick control.</p>

    <p>The mechanism remains to be elucidated,but complement, free radicals, specific anti- bodies
     are not involved. When cultivated on both sides of a microporous membrane, platelets no longer
     inhibit parasite growth, meaning that at least a close contact is necessary. We first studied
     the role of knob-like protrusions which are involved in parasitized red blood cells
     cytoadherence. À knobless strain (K C_) which does not adhere to melanoma cells nor to
     monocytes was inhibited by platelets but to a lesser extent than for the cloned knob-positive,
     adhesion positive one (K C ). Then we investigated the role of platelet cell adhesion receptors
     such as GPIIb/IIlIa, GPIb/IX, GPIV (CD36), using monoclonal antibodies. Only OKM5 (anti GPIV),
     partially reduced platelets inhibition in both strains. Two synthetic peptides, RGD, and
     C-terminal fibrinogen peptide do not interfere with platelets inhibition, so integrins do not
     seem to be involved in this phenomenon.</p>

    <p>In an attempt to identify the principal source of ticks infesting livestock on Rusinga

     week for six months. The roadside area yielded most ticks while the homestead and the lakeshore
     areas yielded the least number of ticks. More ticks were expected to come from the homestead
     and the lakeshore areas due to frequent and long association of ticks with their hosts during
     grazing, wateriug aud nolding at home overnight and a good part of the day. The results suggest
     that there is a faster pick-up rate in the two areas with the least number of ticks.</p>

    <p>Nos observations ont portés sur 178 bovins, d'âge, de race et de sexe differents. Le nombre
     de tiques fixés sur les animaux, et le poids des femelles engorgées, ont été choisis comme
     critères de la resistance des animaux.</p>
    <p>La répartition des tiques rencontrées, est pratiquement la même dans les trois régions: il
     s'agit de Hyalomma detritum, H. lusitanicum, Boophilus annulatus, Rhepicephalus sp et H.
     marginatum qui est la plus dominante(65%).</p>
    <p>Cette étude nous a permis de constater une résistance génétique à l'infestation naturelle.
     Les bovins de race locale sont plus résistants que la race pie noire et à la race croisé. La
     moyenne des nombres de tiques fixées sur les bovins de race locale est réduite de moitié par
     rapport à la pie noire ainsi que le poids des tiques femelles. Cet effet génétique est
     transmissible puisque les animaux croisés résistent mieux que la race pie noire. Sans que l'on
     puisse l'expliquer, l'âge a un rôle particulièrement important.</p>
    <p>Dans les 3 régions, les animaux jeunes resistent mieux que les adultes, quelque soit la race.

     respectivement 5% et 16% par rapport aux adultes.</p>

     BOX 926 - 21045 - RIO DE JANEIRO - BRAZIL Triatomines, Artificial Devices, Feeding, Chagas'
     Disease It is known that the triatomines are able to feed easily in artificial devices, when
     blood is at an adequate range of temperatures to stimulate the piercing response. Most authors
     consider this range to be around 37°C. However, circunstancial observations, in our laboratory
     had shown that some species would have blood-meals even at romm temperature. To study this
     behaviour more sistematically, six species of triatomines were tested with an artificial device
     (latex condom). Insects of all stages deprived of blood-meal for 15-30 days, were allocated in
     two groups: one fed on room-temperature blood (around 25°C) and the other on warm blood (around
     37°C).</p>
    <p>The results are presented on the table below: SPECIES BLOOD AT 25°C BLOOD AT 37°C ru B TI.
     infestans 60.4% 80.8% 29.4 0.001 T. brasiliensis 59.57 82.4% 4.5 0.05 TI. vitticeps 31.97 68.2%

     mepistus 51. 52 87.4% 93.1 0.001 In all tested species, the insects prefered warm blood at
     37°C, except Triatoma pseudomaculata, in which the percentage of insects feeding on
     room-temperature blood was significantly greater than on warm blood. However, the feeding at
     room temperature was also a well accepted, since in all species, at least 31.9% of the insects
     fed this way, on the first four hours of the experiment. It can be concluded that the higher
     temperatures are not essential to stimulate the feeding of the tested triatomines, although
     they have a facilitating effect.</p>

    <p>Tsetseflie - diet - albumin - hemoglobin À synthetic diet for obligatory haematophagous
     insects is of crucial importance with a view to mass-rearing. In KT 80 ( Kabayo and Taher,
     IAEA, 1985 ), up to now the most satisfactory diet for tsetseflies, research will be carried
     out into the macromolecular ingredients: albumin and hemoglobin, which are of important
     nutritional value .</p>
    <p>Albumin : has been treated by solvents to separate the pure albumin from all ligand factors
     and bound compounds. From the latter twe substances, a spectrum has been made.</p>
    <p>Thin-layer-chromatography and HPLC provide interesting data on the composition.</p>
    <p>To know more about these factors, how they influence the behaviour of the flies,a variety of
     diets, to which these bound compounds had been added, were tested on newly emerged females of
     Glossina palpalis palpalis . The flies, kept at 24°5 C and 84 % relative humidity, were fed
     through silicone membranes ( in vitro ), five ta seven days a week, for a period of 30 days.
     A11 diets were irradiated ( 100 krad ) and ATP supplemented before flies were fed. The feeding
     response, fecundity and size of offspring were observed.</p>
    <p>Hemoglobin and the yellow factor : Hemoglobin involves a dialysis on lysed erythrocytes an
     addtional dialysis provides a yellow diffusate. Here an Amicon Ultra-Filtrator with a MWCO of
     8,000 is used. By means of delipidation techniques, the yellow factor has been divided into a
     hydrophylic and a hydrophobic compound. Spectrophotometry, thin- layer-chromatography,
     BAPW-method (Butyl-alcohol/Acetia acid/Pyridine/Water) , RP-chromatography, undoubtedly give
     interesting data on the composition of this factor.</p>
    <p>In the same way, feeding experiments such as those for albumin have been programmmed, with
     this difference that diets were tested on Glossina morsitans centralis.</p>

     addition to 6 locations from which the snails were previously recorded. We were led by the
     proximity of the snail habitat to the residence of the infected individuals. We often used
     pala- wan plants (Cryptosperma merkusii), a relative to taro, as an indicator of snail habitats
     anû it was always reliable in this area. The endemic focus of schistosomiasis on the island is
     confined to only 2 of the 46 munici- palities of the island. Observations were made on the
     ability of O. qua- drasi to survive drying conditions on filter paper. The snails seldom, if
     ever, survived longer than 3 weeks under relative humidities ranged from 60 to 65 percent at
     temperature of 24-27°C, while they could survive at least 3 months in a moist environment. In
     northern Bohol January to May are the drier montns, but extreme variations in rainfall occur by
     the year. In fact, there was a prolonged ädrought for 3 to 4 months in 1983 and 1987. In this
     area, the continuous wet condition would thus appear to make the major differences between the
     places that do and those do not support the snails. Our preliminary data on soil analysis have
     provide some leads explaining why the endenic focus on the island is confined only to the left

     population dynamics During the period 1978-1987 hemipopulation dynamics of trematode meta-
     cercariae Echinoparyphium aconiatum have been followed by investigeating of 12.000 freshwater
     snaïils (Lymnaea, Flanorbis, Fhysa, Anisus). For the estimation of hemipopulation we use the
     occurence and abundance in- dex and a newly proposed index of population density which takes
     into account the role of each snails species in hemipopulation (Yurlova, 1990). The occurence
     of metacercariae varied with years from 18% to 58, their abundance changed from 5 to 15 per
     general host aggregation and hemipopulation density varied from 8.500 to 19.500 per 1 m . In
     diffe- rent phases of multi-year cycle and during one season the main part of hemipopulation is
     connected with the most abundant snail species in biocenosis. Population peaks take place due
     to the presence of small number of higly infected hosts ( mostly midle-dimensioned groups
     }).</p>
    <p>During unfavourable periods snail species with high percentage of in- festation but with low
     abundance of metacercaria in a snail are impor- tant for maintaining hemipopulation.</p>

     employed to study the Anopheles mosquito populations. Breeding sites of the Anopheles were
     checked in the village.</p>
    <p>The majority of the villagers are rubber tappers and occasionally gathers of forest products.
     40-50% of the adults get infected; most of individuals that go into the forest are adults.
     Various species of Anopheles were obtained from cow-baited net trap and human-baits. An.
     maculatus (the vector of malaria) also present.</p>
    <p>It is suspected that the first infection of the disease occurs in the forest-product gathers
     who do not use mosquito net and no prophylactic anti malarial drugs were taken while they are
     in the forest. They inturn become the source of infection for the village (with the abundance
     of the vectors) on their return.</p>

    <p>Previous studies on Anopheles gambiae and An.melas in coastal areas of Benin were based on
     chromosomal identification of half gravid indoor resting mosquitoes (Akogbeto et al., 1987,
     1988), Further observations were carried out on material from night catches on man. Female
     identification was based on palpal index whose high discriminat- ing value (more than 95%
     correct identifications) has been established on chromosomally scored females, The results
     obtained from the analysis of 3,363 chromosomally and/or morphologically identified specimens
     can be summarized as follows: 1) An.gambiae and An.melas are sympatric in most localities,
     their frequency depending, as expected, on the availability of fresh and salt water breeding
     places, respectively, 2) An.melas is the dominant species (or even the only one present) in
     traditional villages in lagoon areas, while An:gambiae generally prevails in zones of unplanned
     urban development; 3) An:melas feeds mainly on pigs which are widespread as domestic animals
     and even in samples from bedrooms the human blood index (HBI) is only about 0,30; 4) in the
     same en- vironmental conditions An.gambiae shows HBI around 0.70; 5) the above mentioned marked
     difference in anthropophily is probably very much underestimated due to outdoor resting of most
     An.melas feeding outdoors on animals; 6) Positivity for the circumsporozoite and 19 out of
     1,563 An.gambiae (1.22%), Assuming equal man biting densities and taking into account the
     difference in anthropophily, the infective bites contributed by An.gambiae should be at least
     ten fold those contributed by An.melas. The overall epidemiological picture emerging from this
     study is that, unless the ecological changes favoring ÂAn.gambiae are monitored and
     counteracted, the transmission potential for S10.C 3 P+0 TRANSMISSIVE DISEASES AGENTS

     Laboratory of Arboviruses Ecology, Institute of Polio- myelitis and Viral Encephalitides, USSR
     Academy of Medical Sciences, 142782, Moscow Region, USSR Ticks, mosquitoes, arboviruses, hosts
     behaviour, transmission ways The author describes as a basis of successful transmission of
     vector -borne disease agents two types of homeostatic mechanisms: the changes in the host
     behaviour of infected arthropods under the agent influence and diversity of transmission ways
     which increases the hosts change probasbility. As examples of the first type of mechanism the
     changes in the behaviour of infected vector during the host searching period are described such
     as changes in the vector recep- tor susceptibility to the host attractive factors (among ticks
     infected with TBE virus) and of the changes in mobility which incre- ases the probability of
     successful hosthunting (mosquitoes infected whith brugia or plasmodia). The other behavioristic
     changes are important during bloodsucking period: repeated attempts of microbeb- locked fleas,
     enlargement of the period of vessel search and blood- sucking process because of phagoreceptors
     blockade (among Glossina or Phlebotominae flies) or saliva biochemical changes (shortage of
     apirase among plasmodia and arboviruses infected mosquitoes).</p>
    <p>The second type of homeostasis is illustrated by diversity of THE (tickborne encephalitis)
     virus circulation ways: by diversity of transmission during the bite period (virus in the
     lubricant, cement- forming and waterrich'saliva fractions) to the vertebrate and to cofeeding
     uninfected ticks, transovarial and sexual and also omovam- pirie weyg of transmission. 1168

     adults of the deer tick, Ixodes dammini, taken from the same area were infected with B.
     burgdorferi. In addition, 14 white- footed mice (Peromyscus leucopus) trapped at this site of
     high A. americanum density were not infested by this species. In the laboratory, nymphs of A.
     americanum failed to attach to P. leucopus. It appears that this tick is not a competent vector

     Samarkand,Uzbekistan, USSR An epidemiological investigation of the population in the foci of
     Tick Borreliosis (TB) in 7 settlements of Fergana valley was carried out by means of
     house-to-house examinations. The aim was to study the inten- siveness of the population's
     contact with vector, to reveal the circum- stances, determining the probability of such
     contact, to identify the age groups of the risk population and the seasonal dynamics of the de-
     sSease. 16000 individuals were examined - 1 per cent of whom had con- teact with vector, which
     occured mainly in the houses of old constructi- on. It was found that in average 1 person had
     two contacts with vector, Out of 412 feverish we revealed 31 TB patients. It was noted that
     main- 1y the original population was affected by the disease. Incidence rate was not age
     dependent and mainly individuals between 15-39 were affec- ted, about 40 per cent of all
     patients were between 20-29 years. The disease is recorded throughout the whole year, with
     seasonal peaks in Kay-June, which could be explained by the biological characteristics of the

    <p>In October 1989, a double blind, placebo controlled trial was implemented in French Polynesia
     to compare effects of ivermectin and DEC single dose treatments on transmis sion of Wuchereria
     bancrofti in vector Aedes polynesiensis. Twenty eight carriers were included into the study, of
     whom 18 were randomly allocated to 1 of the 3 treatments ivermectin 100 meg/kg, DEC 3 and DEC 6
     mg/kg. The other 10 were given placebo. More than 1 000 laboratory bred A. polynesiensis were
     blood fed on the 28 carriers before and 1, 3 and 6 months after treatment. Of them, batches of
     30 mosquitoes were dissected every day during 15 days. At one month, complete peripheral blood
     microfilarial (mf) clearance was observed in 7 of the 18 carriers who received effective
     treatment. No larvae were observed in the mosquitoes fed on those carriers. In the mosquitoes
     fed on the other 11, the rate of ingested mf (ingested mf/carrier mf density), the rate of mf
     passed through stomachal barrier (thoracic larvae on D2/ingested mf) and the rate of infective
     larvae (infective larvae on D12/thoracic larvae on D2) were significantly lower (p&lt;0.05) as
     compared to those observed in the mosquitoes fed on placebo treated carriers with blood
     comparable mf densities. This trial will permit assessment as to whether, in addition to the
     reduction of mf density in carriers, antifilarial treatments might induce a reduction of
     transmission in vector. Moreover, possible drug-related differences in reduction of
     transmission will be determined.</p>

    <p>Dicrocoeliidae - Molluscs intermediate host - Helicella.</p>
    <p>For the last two years a study of the complex life cycle of Dicrocoelium dendri- ticum
     (Rudolphi, 1819) Loos 1899 in the definitive (ovine) and intermediate (mollusc and ant) hosts
     has been carried out in the Leén mountain region. Nevertheless, in this paper only the data
     referring to the land mollusc species which live in the study area and the monthly dynamics of
     the prevalence and intensity of their natural infection by Dicrocoeliidae are summarized. The
     malacological samplings took place in the upper Porma basin at an altitude of 1150 to 1400 m,
     in 300 hectares of siliceous soil and 260 of calcareous soil, grazed by a sheep flock.</p>
    <p>The number of mollusc species found was 26, which belong to 1 family of the Mesogas- tropoda
     order and 13 of the Stylommatophora order. The helminthological studies were carried out on a
     total of 3502 mollusc specimens. However, infection with sporocysts of Dicrocoeliidae at
     different stages of development was only detected in Helicella (Helicella) itala (Linnaeus,
     1758) and Helicella corderoi Gittenberger and Manga, 1977. The infection prevalence for the
     2084 specimens of the first species and the 852 of the second one was 2.97% and 1.06%,
     respectively. Both species were collected in every month of the year, although the highest
     infection prevalence was detected in September (6.38%) in Helicella (H.) itala and in February
     (4.54%) in H. corderoi.</p>
    <p>Prevalence values increased with the size of the molluscs, being 5.07% and 1.51% in the
     adults and 0.63% and 0.33% in the young ones of the first ‘and second species, respectively.
     Although well developed cercariae were observed during almost all the year, the most dangerous
     period for the infection of ants (second intermediate host) seems to be the end of winter and
     the beginning of spring.</p>

    <p>Analyse quantitative - Histologie - Limitation - À. aegypti.</p>
    <p>L'équilibre des foyers parasitaires filariens, est principalement contrôlé par les phénomènes
     qui accompagnent la traversée de l'épithélium stomacal du vecteur par les microfilaires (Bain,
     1971).</p>
    <p>L'analyse, numérique et histologique, du couple Brugia malayi - Aedes aegypti, est faite en
     nutritions naturelle et artificielle. Celles-ci donnent des résultats identiques, et
     contrairement à ce qui est admis, il se manifeste très tôt (2h après le repas) une forte
     limitation stomacale: pour une moyenne de microfilaires ingérées (MI) de 33 à 38, seulement 23%
     des microfilaires passent dans l'hémocèle (MP), par contre pour une moyenne de 2 MI il y a 72%
     de MP. Les droites de régression du rapport MI / MP en fonction de MI démontrent que le nombre
     de MP est une fonction hyperbolique du nombre de MI. Si l'on compare aux autres couples
     filaire-vecteur connus, l'intensité du phénomène de limitation, marquée par la pente de la
     droite paraît croître avec le diamètre de la microfilaire. En histologie, la limitation
     s'explique comme pour les autres cas étudiés, par un blocage des microfilaires dans les
     cellules digestives chez les moustiques qui ont ingéré beaucoup de microfilaires; la cellule
     touchée se lyse puis est expulsée dans la lumière stomacale en même temps que la microfilaire.
     Le couple Dirofilaria immitis - A. aegypti représente un cas très particulier: les
     microfilaires passent directement par la jonction estomac - proctodeum pour atteindre les tubes
     de Malpighi; cependant certaines microfilaires se trouvent dans l'épithélium digestif, mais
     aucune ne paraît arriver dans l'hémocèle.</p>

     39762 USA Cattle Movement, Management, Dipteran vectors During the day cattle are observed to
     graze away from forest areas. The purpose of this study was to determine the Dipteran pest
     population in open pasture and adjacent forest as a possible factor for host movement. These
     potential vectors of disease pathogens were collected from cattle at 20 and 120 m in the forest
     and at 20, 120, 220, 420 and 720 m into an adjacent open pasture. From 56 collections over an 8
     wk period a total of 5,411 specimens were taken. The Tabanidae accounted for 69% of specimens
     with 11 species collected. A peak of 217 was collected at 420 m and decreased to 9% at 120 m in
     the pasture. The Culicidae accounted for 10% of the total. Further, 72 and 197 were collected
     at 120 and 20 m in the forest, respectively. The Muscidae accounted for 197 of the total. At
     120 and 220 m in the pasture 47% were collected. Other families of Diptera accounted for about
     2% of the total. These pests were generally confined to the forest. From this study I conclude
     that the tabanids may not be a factor in cattle movement away from the forest areas. However, a
     heavy population of Culicidae could be a factor for movement.</p>

     of Egypt and the U.S. Agency for International Development. Duringthe next ten years, targeted
     research will be conducted to develop vaccine candidates, simpler immunodiagnostic methods, and
     inexpensive new pharmaceuticals for treatment. Epidemiologic and socio- economic data will be
     collected to guide the introduction of these new methodologies into disease control programs.
     An autonomous Secretariat within the Egyptian Ministry of Health implements this program with
     assistance from an international and technical assistance organization, Medical Service
     Corporation International of Arlington, Virginia.</p>
    <p>The comprehensive research strategy of the SRP was designed by a team of over 30
     international schistosomiasis research experts. They identified 63 targeted research projects
     to be conducted collaboratively by U.S. and Egyptian research institutions. In addition, the
     SRP is underwriting a training program for young Egyptian scientists to ensure the long-term
     continuity of this program.</p>
    <p>Eight research projects were funded in November 1989-—six in the field of vaccine development
     (detection of circulating antigens, DNA cloning and anti-pathology vaccine production) and two
     for improving immunodiagnostic techniques. A further 15 Egyptian investigators received funding
     in March 1990 for studies in the fields of epidemiology, chemotherapy , socio-economic research
     and operational research.</p>
    <p>An epidemiological study will determine the changing patterns of transmission and the extent
     of morbidity due to schistosomiasis in Egypt. Another study will assess the impact of a recent
     television advertising campaign on knowledge, attitudes and practices in rural and urban
     communities.</p>

     Institute of Med.Parasitology,lsaeva,38,Samarkand, USSR, An urgent need for the protection of
     the population against Zoonotic Cu- taneous Leishmaniasis (ZCL) appeared in connection with
     reclamation of vergin lands of Djizak steppe 12 settlements with adjoining territory of the
     total area of 102,6 thousands hectars were taken under protecti- on. In this territory we
     revealed and mapped 2895 colonies of Rhombo- mys opimus - the main reservoir of the infection.
     13,7 % of which were inhabited. Ph. papatasi was the main vector of the disease. Two methods
     were used for control of R. opimus: mechanical distruction of colonies by ploughing tractors
     and chemical - grain bait poisoned by 20% phosphi- de zink. With the help of the first method
     we elliminated 1145 colonies.</p>
    <p>The second method was used three times each year. As the result of com- bined usage of these
     two methods for 5 years a complete and Steady eli- mination of natural reservoir and human
     cases of ZCL was achieved. Sand- fly control in the natural biotops was carried out according
     to the en- tomological indices in the radius of 1-2 km. from the populated area.</p>
    <p>Desinsection was carried out with the help of DDT and HCH with the ef- fectiveness of
     68,7-88,3% which lasted for 10-12 days, Examination which was conducted 3 years later
     demonstrated high level of epidemio- logical effectiveness of the abovementioned control

     Persulcatus group - Vectors — Lyme disease Analysis of both species composition of vectors and
     biological relati- ons of each species with Borrelia burgdorferi (degree of natural infec-
     tion, display of transstadial and transovarial transmission) allows re- veals mrin vectors.
     These are Ixodes ricinus, I. persulcatus in Euro- asia, and I. scapularis, I. pacificus, I.
     dammini, TJ. dentatus in North America. The first of four within the subgenus (s, str.) species
     were classified by the author on comparative-ontogenetic basis as phyletic ersulcatus group
     before Lyme disease was discovered (Filippova, 1971, 1973). T palearctic, 4 nearctic and 2
     indomaleyan species were placed in the persulcatus group in these publications. The recent
     comparative- ontogenetic analysis shows that I. dammini described in 1979 belongs to this
     group, too. I. dentatus is CloSely related to I. pavlovskyi, a pa- learctic member of the
     persulcatus group. .</p>

    <p>Fe Multiple antigen peptide, Plasmodium malariae, antibodies, sporozoites, ELISA Multiple
     antigen peptides (MAPs), consisting of a number of peptide copies synthesized on a branching
     lysyl core, offer a novel approach for rendering small peptides immuno- reactive in solid-phase
     immunoassays. An octameric MAP, carrying 6 repeats of the sequence -NAAG-, tandemly repeated in
     the immunodominant region of the circumsporozoite (CS) protein, was evaluated in an indirect
     ELISA for its suitability to detect antibodies to P. malariae sporozoites in endemic sera. The
     synthetic construct MAP -(NAAG) , used as coating antigen, reacted with a monoclonal antibody
     (mAb) raised against P. malariae sporozoites, showing that the epitopes of the CS-repeats were
     present on the MAP bound to the microtiter plate. A considerable proportion of endemic sera
     reached optical densities (0D)&gt;1.000, whereas consistently low values (mean OD = 0.180) were
     obtained with non- endemic sera. In a competitive assay, the mÂb reactivity could be inhibited
     by endemic sera, giving evidence of a specific antibody binding to MAP. The reactivity of the
     endemic sera was found to be directed only to the (NAAG) peptides and not to the lysyl core,
     for antibody binding to MAP was completely inhibited by CNAAG) monomer, but not by the lysyl
     core. The MAP-based immunoassay proved to be sensitive, since with 50 ng/ml of mAb, an OD of
     -1.000 was obtained. In conclusion, the specificity and sensitivity of MAP -(NAAG) in ELISA
     make it suitable to detect antibodies to P. malariae sporozoites in Ébidemiological studies. En

     groups of Amblyomma variegatum ticks were compared for their ability to acquire and transmit
     infection with Cowdria ruminantium, causative agent of heartwater in wild and domestic
     ruminants. Ticks were from laboratory colonies at the International Laboratory for Research on
     Animal Diseases (ILRAD), Nairobi, Kenya, and the Kenya Agricultural Research Institute (KARI),
     Veterinary Laboratories, Kabete, Kenya. Nymphs from both colonies were simultaneously fed on a
     goat that had been infected with C. ruminantium and was febrile. Replete nymphs from both
     groups were then incubated under identical conditions.Guts from unfed adults were dissected,
     fixed, embedded in plastic,cut on a microtome, stained and thick sections were examined by
     light microscopy. Adult ticks were also fed on susceptible goats. (4 goats per each tick group,
     2 pairs of ticks per goat).The number of ticks in which colonies of organisms could be seen by
     light micro- scopy (51% of the ILRAD ticks as compared to 27% of th KARI ticks) was
     different.</p>
    <p>Additionally, the ILRAD ticks were consistently greater than 10% infected (measured by number
     of colonies per epithelial cell) whereas the KARI ticks were consistently less than 10%
     infected. No difference in the ability of the two groups to transmit heartwater occurred.</p>

     5BG, U.K.</p>
    <p>Hymenolepis diminuta metacestodes - host-behaviour Some aspects of the behaviour of Tenebrio
     molitor (Coleoptera) infected with metacestodes of the rat tapeworm, Hymenolepis diminuta, have
     been investigated to determine whether changes occur which may render the intermediate host
     more susceptible to predation and thus enhance parasite transmission. Using a choice chamber
     composed of light and dark environments it was demonstrated that the negative phototropic
     response exhibited by uninfected T. molitor was not significantly affected by ageing.
     Parasitized beetles 5-6 days post-infection (8-9 days post-emergence) were also strongly
     negatively phototropic (e.g. 13.67% of male beetles, tested singly, were in the light
     environment after 20 min testing).</p>
    <p>However, by 12-13 days PI, when metacestodes were fully developed, this negative phototactic
     response had been lost (40.97 infected males in the light compared with 15.47 controls). A
     similar effect was observed in female beetles. A bioassay was used to demonstrate that
     metacestode infection also significantly affected male mating behaviour. Exposure to copulatory
     release pheromone, collected from uninfected 6-day-old females, elicited a response in 92%
     (n=60) of control 5-day-old uninfected males compared with only 37% (n=60) of infected
     males.</p>
    <p>Uninfected T. molitor are known to aggregate in dark places. This significant change in
     response to light and to a sex pheromone may result in infected beetles spending more time in
     isolation in the light, and thus increase the risk of exposure to predation.</p>

     M.Swairi:Ministry of Health,Riyadh 11176,Saudi Arabia Schistosomiasis Control in Saudi Arabia
     By using mass-diagnosis and treatment of cases together with snail control,a significant
     reduction in the prevalence of both intestinal and urinary schistosomiasis has occurred in all
     12 foci of the infection which are distributed in 5 regions of Saudi Arabia.</p>
    <p>Infection with Schistosoma mansoni has dropped in Central Region (Riyadh and Hail)and in all
     foci within the western provinces.</p>
    <p>Reduction has also occurred in the prevalence of $S haematobium in foci of Gizan,the Red Sea
     Coastal areas and Madina. The disease is no longer found in the Riyadh Region. The overall
     prevalence in all 12 foci of the infection in Saudi Arabia dropped gradually from 11% in 1983
     to 1.83% in 1989. The number of districts which had rates of 10% or more has dropped from 46 in
     1983 to nil in 1987,and the number with rates of 5 to 10% from 25 in 1983 to one in 1987. The
     overall prevalence is presently between one and less than 5% in 73 districts and less than 1%
     in 41 districts.</p>
    <p>More success in the control is expected with the integration of schistosomiasis into the
     primary health care system which has started from late 1988.</p>

    <p>mosquito, area, density, prevention of malaria By means of itenerary entomological
     investigations, taking into conside- ration anthropogenic transformation we found that among 7
     species of ma- laria mosquitoes of Uzbekistan the area où distribution of Anopheles ma-
     culipennis Sacharovi Favr. was reduced and that of An. pulcherrimus Theo was significantly
     extended. The distribution of An. superpictus Gr. has mosaic character. An. hyrcanus Pall, is
     distributed almost in the whole territory of the Republic. Recovery of the vector's population
     densiti- es is connected with reduction of insecticide treatment in postliquidea- tion period,
     susceptibility of vectors to insecticides and the influence of the anthropogenic factors which
     lead to the ecologicaï changes of the environment. It was noted that in the modern
     entomological situation the minimum threshold in the density of vector s population, participa-
     ting in transmission of infection, became much lower and in the rural area this threshold is
     higher than in the urban. Measures of malaria prevention on the background of recovery of
     density of vector's popula- tion, its resistence and recording of "“imported'" cases should be
     orga- nized taking into consideration the ecological and biological characte- ristics of
     vectors, economic activity in the protected area, control neasures should include the whole
     complex of measures (sanitary-hydro- technical, annihilative, protective and zooprophilactic)
     promoting the integrated "management!" of density of the vector s population.</p>

    <p>Une étude de la transmission du paludisme humain a été menée pendant un an, en bordure d’un

     11°E).</p>
    <p>La faune culicidienne agressive pour l’homme est composée surtout par le genre Anopheles qui
     représente 93% des captures. Ce genre regroupe les espèces An. nili (83% des captures), An.
     gambiae (16%) et An. funestus (&lt;1%).</p>
    <p>L’écologie larvaire de ces deux premières espèces est telle que leurs variations de densité
     imaginale sont liées à celles du débit du fleuve.</p>
    <p>- Les trous de rochers découverts lors des basses eaux, de décembre à mai, sont d’excellents
     gîtes potentiels pour les stades préimaginaux d’An. gambiae. Cette espèce est rare en période
     de crue, lorsque ces trous de rochers sont immergés.</p>
    <p>- Les larves d’An. nili exploitent les anses du fleuve où le courant est ralenti par la
     végétation dressée le long des berges. Cette espèce est permanente mais elle est abondante
     surtout entre juin et septembre lors des hautes eaux.</p>
    <p>Les indices sporozoïtiques ont été évalués par deux méthodes : la méthode classique de
     recherche microscopique des sporozoïtes de Plasmodium dans les glandes salivaires des anophèles
     et la méthode immunologique de recherche et de quantification des antigènes
     circumsporozoïtiques (Ag CS) de P. fakciparum par ELISA. Les indices spozoïtiques par la
     méthode classique sont de 3,6% pour An. gambiae et de 0,75% pour An. nili. Par la méthode
     immunologique ces indices sont trois fois plus élevés. Il est à souligner que la quantité d’Ag
     CS des An. nili positifs est 10 fois plus importante que celle des An. gambiae positifs.</p>
    <p>Dans cette zone forestière, en bordure du fleuve Sanaga, la transmission du paludisme est
     permanente et intense. Le taux annuel d’inoculation est de l’ordre d’une centaine de piqûres
     infectées par homme. Des variations saisonnières sont observées : environ une piqüre infectée
     par homme et par jour en avril et une piqüre infectée par homme par mois en octobre. La
     permanence de la transmission est assurée par An. nili tandis que ses variations saisonnières
     sont dues à la présence ou à l’absence d’An. gambiae. Le paludisme y est stable.</p>
    <p>Les indices d’endémicité sont toujours très élevés avec des variations saisonnières peu

    <p>Urinary schistosomiasis - Screening - Health statistics - Disease perception Four approaches
     for the fast, district-wide screening of urinary schistosomiasis were compared in Southeastern
     Tanzania.</p>
    <p>Firstly, an analysis was done of the disease statistics available from all health services (n
     = 20). Secondly, a simple questionnaire on community development issues (including health and
     schistosomiasis) was sent to all village chairmen of the ruling party (N = 51). Thirdly, a
     similar questionnaire was sent to all headteachers of primary schools (N = 77), together with a
     simpler questionnaire aimed at schoolchildren (N = 6772).</p>
    <p>Finally, our team visited 56 out of the 77 schools of the district and tested 4469 children
     by the urine filtration method.</p>
    <p>The best coverage and diagnostic performance were achieved by the school questionnaires. The
     return rates after one month were 100% (teacher) and 97% (children). The sensitivity and
     specificity of the children's questionnaire for the detection of high-risk schools
     (parasitological prevalence rate &gt; 50%) were 100% and 87.3%, resulting in a high negative
     predictive value. The questionnaires were 27 times cheaper than the parasitological surveys. o
     School questionnaires relying on the disease perception of teacher and children were found to
     be fast and cost-efficient for a first district-wid screening of urinary schistosomiasis,
     allowing to exclude negative schools and to concentrate resources on the positive ones.</p>

     falciparum, IgM antibody, sporozoites, ELISA The role of IgM antibodies (Abs) in protective
     immunity against P. (L.)falciparum (P. f.) sporozoites and in malaria epidemiology remains to
     be determined. As the availability of a reliable assay is a prerequisite to tackle these
     questions, 3 ELISA-systems were com- pared for the specificity in detecting IgM Abs to
     sporozoites. Processing endemic sera with a conventional indirect ELISA (I-ELISA), a 4- and a
     5-step reversed ELISA (4 and 5 R-ELISA), the best results were obtained with the 5 R-ELISA. In
     this assay, i) microtiter plates were coated with an anti-IgM monoclonal Ab (mAb) and
     sequentially incubated with ii) serum samples, iii) (NANP) , a 40-meric synthetic peptidyl
     polymer of the sequence —NANP-, which is tandem repeated in the immunodominant region of the
     circumsporozoite protein of Pe Le, iv) a peroxidase-labelled mAb raised against Pe £e
     sporozoites and v) the substrate of peroxidase. Each serum had its own control, represented by
     a well in which all reagents but (NANP) were added. Due to this built-in control, some sera re-
     sulting positive in the I-ELISA and/or in the 4 R-ELISA, could be identified as false
     positives. In the I-ELISA, the false positivity arose from the antiserum to human IgM, which
     bound to auto-IlgM anti-IgG present in some tested sera. The 4 R-ELISA, in which IgM Abs to
     sporozoites were directly detected by peroxidase-labelled (NANP) , was affected by the
     reactivity of some sera on the enzymatic moiety of the conjugate. In the 5 R-ELISA the problem
     of false positives was overcome by actually measuring the non-specific compo- nent of the
     reaction. Thus, a reliable assay to study the IgM response to P. f. sporo- zoites could be
     developed.</p>

     Paludisme, urbain, suburbain, Yaoundé.</p>
    <p>Une étude entomologique et parasitologique du paludisme est en cours à Yaoundé. Cette ville
     est la capitale du Cameroun et regroupe 800 000 habitants. Elle présente un relief particulier
     avec une alternance de collines et de bas-fonds marécageux ; dans ces derniers s'accumulent les
     eaux de ruisselement et les eaux usées constituant ainsi d'excellents gîtes préimaginaux à
     Anopheles et à Culex.</p>
    <p>. Quatre quartiers ont été choisis pour cette étude : - NKOL BISSON, quartier périphérique en
     cours d'urbanisation. Il présente encore un caractère rural avec de la forêt secondaire et des
     broussailles. Il existe dans ce quartier un étang naturel qui favorise la reproduction des
     anophèles.</p>
    <p>- NKOL BIKOK, quartier situé en zone semi-urbaine avec une vaste surface marécageuse.</p>
    <p>- ESSOS, quartier typiquement urbain. Il est bâtit sur une colline à pente faible et des
     bas-fonds marécageux propices au développement des anophèles.</p>
    <p>- OBILI, ce quartier présente les même caractéristiques qu'Essos mais il est modifié par des
     bassins de pisciculture.</p>
    <p>Les résultats disponibles portent sur la période de mars à décembre 1989.</p>
    <p>Quatre espèces de moustiques sont agressives pour l'homme, la nuit dans les maisons :
     Anopheles gambiae, An. funestus, Culex quinquefasciatus et M: ia Sp.</p>
    <p>An. gambiae est pratiquement le seul anopèle observé. An. funestus n'est rencontré qu'à ESSOS
     où il représente 1% des captures.</p>
    <p>L'agressivité anophélienne est la plus forte à NKOL BISSON avec 6 piqûres/homme/nuit (p/h/n).
     Elle diminue progressivement vers le centre urbain : 1 p/h/n à NKOL BIKOK, 0,9 p/h/n à ESSOS ET
     0,3 p/h/n à OBILI. Dans ce dernier quartier les bassins de pisciculture mal entretenus
     (nénuphars) sont des gîtes très productifs en Mansonia. Ceci explique la forte agressivité de
     ces moustiques dans ce quartier : 11 p/h/n contre 1,2 à ESSOS.</p>
    <p>La transmission du paluäise suit 4 même évolution que celle de la densité anopnélieniie : 26
     piqôres i:fsstées/homme/an (pi/h/a) à NKOL BISSON, 17 pi/h/a à NKOL BIKOK et 15 pi/n/a à
     ESSOS.</p>
    <p>Cx. quinquefasciatus reste le moustique urbain par excellence et représente 52% des captures
     à OBILI et 84% à ESSOS. Sa densité relative diminue fortement à NKOL BISSON au profit d'An.
     gambiae qui représenre 90% des captures.</p>
    <p>Les données relatives à la transmission entomologiques sont en accord avec les résultats des
     enquêtes parasitologiques. On observe une diminution de la prévalence parasitaire et de la
     charge parasitaire moyenne de la périphérie vers le centre urbain. En effet à NKOL BISSON la
     prévalence parasitaire est de 70% alors qu'elle est de 35% à ESSOS et de 19% à OBILI. Dans la
     ville de Ysoundé la transmission du paludisme varie en sens inverse du degré d'urbanisation qui
     augmente de la périphérie vers le centre.</p>

     SPECIES IN HUNAK MALARIA TRANSHISSION.</p>

    <p>Malaria- Anopheles- Transmission- Mathematical model In situations such as in Sri Lanka,
     where several anopheline species act as vectors of human malaria, the vectorial capacity
     estimations required for quantitative studies on transmission necessitate the measurement of
     several vector parameters relating to each individual species. This is tedious, particularly
     where vector prevalences are low. We have therefore derived a mathematical expression to
     estimte the relative transmission efficiency (RTE) of an anopheline species with respect to a
     standard well characterized species. The expression allowed the estimtion of the RTE using
     conveniently measurable parameters such as man biting rate, average sporozoite rate and the
     human malaria incidence in the locality; the RTE also accounts for differences in the
     biological competences of Anopheline species to support sporogonic development, which has been
     overlooked in previous studies. Using RTE we calculated an "effective man biting rate" (eMBR)
     i.e., the MBR of a species if it were to have properties identical to those of a standard
     species. The properties of the standard well characterized species alone could then be used
     with the "eMBR" of all species to quantify transmission. The need to measure properties of all
     different anopheline species that contributed to transmission was thus overcome. We have also
     shown here mathematically that, under stable conditions, i.e. when the MBR does not vary
     appreciably, the average sporozoite rate in a species during a transmission season would by
     itself reflect its transmission efficiency. Using this expression we estimated the RTE of 6
     Anopheline species in Sri Lanka that were infected with sporozoites of human mlaria parasites
     in the wild.</p>

     intermediate hosts of Thyseniezia giardi in India have not been discovered nor have the Life
     cycle ami larval stages of this tape worm been studied. There is no earlier report with regard
     to the vector or biological studies of this anoplocephalin cestode. It was thought worth-while
     to investigate in details in respect of biology of Thyseniezia giardi ani the findings are
     presented’ below.</p>
    <p>$cheloribates carvialatus and other common oribatid mites from soils of Punjab state
     colleécted by Harle's fünnel technique were grown in pure laboratory cultures for several
     generations, These infection free mites were exposed to heavy concentrations of eggs obtained
     from fresh gravid segments of T. giardi in batches of 1520) mites in each vial (Hersmpue 1976,
     kept in 82:5% moisture &amp; 22.7-33,.2°C Larval development was studied by periodic dissection
     of mites. Ds experiments were repeated 2-4 times for each oribated species. Only S. carvialatus
     was found infected and the larval development was normal, Progressive larval stages of T.
     giardi in the mites consisted of oncosphere round oblong and elongated IlärvVae; larvae with
     cercomer and cysticercoid. Irregular development of larve at various stages of growth in the
     body cavity of an individual mite was comnon. The cysticercoid was formed 30 days after
     exposure to eggs of T. giardi.</p>

     INSTITUTE, Box 53, Ifakara, Tanzania malaria, chloroquine, gametocyte The aim of the study is
     to determine longitudinally some of the risk factors of malaria by assessing the clinical
     attack rate, immune status and exposure rate to infectious bites in order to propose
     intervention measures aimed at reducing the risk of disease at the community level.</p>
    <p>A cohort of 297 under five year old children, 366 school aged children (5 to 14 years) and
     209 adults was followed. Perceived health status and entomological risk factors at the
     household level were assessed biweekly through a questionnaire and light traps.</p>
    <p>Serological determinants were collected every two months.</p>
    <p>Findings after a first high transmission season (April-June) indicated a high prevalence of
     gametocytes in the study population: 31% in infants, 30% in under-fives, 19% in the 5-14 age
     group, and 7% in adults. Urinary chloroquine levels, measured concurrently by thin layer
     chromatography, indicated a very high prevalence of chloroquine consumption: 60% in infants,
     49% in under-fives, 31% in the 5-14 age group, and 40% in adults. The results suggest that
     chloroquine consuption may stimulate gametocytaemia, thus increas- ing human infectiousness and
     enhancing transmission. Parallel immunological studies are being carried out to further
     investigate this phenomenon.</p>

    <p>Usambara mountains, weekly 12-hour biting catches on man were carried out for 13 months near
     Amani. A survey on the prevalence of onchocerciasis was also carried out in all the 17
     villages. Comparison of results indicated the mean biting-catch in 1985/6 to be only 13% of
     that in 1963/4 and comprised 91% S. woodi and 9% Simulium nyasalandicum. The infection rates of
     S. woodi with O. volvulus larvae had also fallen markedly from 17% to 3% of parous flies. No S.
     Nyasalandicum female were infected.</p>
    <p>Out of 2,968 inhabitants of all ages skin-snipped in the area, 22.7% were positive for 0.
     volvulus microfilariae. The infection rates in the under 19 and under 10 age group were 10.3%
     and 6.6% respectively. The overal prevalence rose steadly with age, the mean microfilarial
     density reaching a plateau at age 24. A significant (P&lt;O.001) decline in prevalence of
     infection was observed when compared with results obtained 22 years previously. These drops are
     thought to be due to the effects of extensive deforestation on the vector population.
     Transmission is likely to rise as à result of a re-afforestation programme in the area.</p>

     longitudinal entomological survey of loaiasis was conducted in Missama village (Lekoumou
     region) in the Congo from September 1987 to August 1989. The principal collecting site was a
     palm-grove surrounded by the forest 3 km from the village. Biting and fly densities of Cysaps
     were also assessed in the village and in the fields by standardized fly catches of 11 hours
     eight times monthly Flies were grouped into € 5//2cea and € dimidrata and dissected for
     infections with developing stages of 02 /0a.</p>
    <p>Chrvsops silacea Was identified as the predominant vector species except at the beginning of
     the rainy season (September and October). It was calculated that 2.355 € s//acea and 1.207 €
     dimidrata per vear could bite a person in the palm-grove, including an average of 14 infective
     € s//acea and 10 € dimidiata. The estimated Annual Transmission Potentials (ATP) of € s7/acea
     Were 175 (year 1) and 96 (year 2) in this site. For € @imidiata, ATPS were 113 and 69,
     respectively. Transmission occurred during the rainy season (October to June).</p>

    <p>Malaria transmission, Brazilian Amazon, Anopheline infection, antisporozoite immunity In
     order to evaluate the relationship between malaria transmission and development of
     anti-sporozoite immunity in the Amazon we studied the rate of infected Anopheles(through an
     IRMA employing species specific anti-sporozoite monoclonal antibodies) and the level of
     anti-sporozoite antibodies (by using an IRMA employing the (NANP)4 synthetic peptide) in four
     areas in Rondonia State: Ariquemes, Machadinho, Cujubim and Itapoä do Oeste.</p>
    <p>Sixty-one out of 12336 anophelines of 12 species tested were positive: 43 An. darlingi (37
     were infected with P. falciparum (f) and 6 with P. vivax (v)), 5 An.triannulatus Gv), &amp;
     Ari. albitarsis (2f/2v), 2 An. braziliensis (1f/1v), 2 An. strodei (2V) and 1 An.oswaldoi (£).
     The frequency of infected Anopheles per 10 hours of capture was: 0,56 in Cujubim,, 0.33 in
     Machadinho, 0.24 in Ariquemes and 0.16 in Itapoa.</p>
    <p>From a total of 988 tested sera 50 (5,1 4) were positive for the presence of Anti- P.</p>
    <p>falciparum sporozoite antibodies, 10% (15) of individuals from Cujubim, 4.9 Z (24) from
     Ariquemes, 3.37% (9) from Machadinho and 2.77 (2) from Itapoä showing a clear relationship
     between malaria transmission and development of Anti-sporozoite immunity. However, IRMA titers
     were not relate to the age or sex of individuals or the number of past attacks of malaria or
     years of ‘residence, a fact that could indicate that these are not accurate parameters to
     predict the probable degree of anti-sporozoite immunity, which seems to be related to the rate
     of infected Anopheles. But in the population studied comprehending mainly not immune migrant,
     more time of exposure to infected Anopheline bites seems to be necessary before significant
     degree of Anti-sporozoite immunity is developed.</p>

    <p>Susceptibility to P. falciparum vas influenced by larval crowding (nutrition) and age of
     adult mosquitoes. In models used for the calculation of vectorial capacity, note has to be
     taken of these data on mosquito eurvival, the extrinsic cycle and the fact that gporozoite

    <p>Bulinus sp. Fasciola hepatica. Lymnaea truncatula. Miracidium. Physa sp. Planorbis sp.</p>
    <p>Experimental studies have been realized by exposure of a songle fasciolid miracidium in
     contact with two snaïls of different species: the first snail was Lymnaea truncatula and the
     second was Bulinus truncatus, Physa acuta, P. hypnorum, or Planorbis rotundatus. Four groups
     consisted of young snaïls (1 mm high) and four others concerned adults (4 to 6 mm high) with 50
     couples per group. The snails have been raised at 20° C and killed at day 2 postexposure for
     histological observations. The infection rate is reckoned by the presen- ce of living or
     degenerated sporocysts into the snails, and with tunnel-shaped lacunae made by the migrations
     of abortive sporocysts. The rate was higher in adult P. hypnorum (60 Z) than in L. truncatula;
     the percentages ranged from 52 to 58 % for L. truncatula in the other adult groups. It was
     higher in juvenile L. truncatula (50 to 60 %) than in the four other species. The number of
     living sporocysts ranged from 1 to 7 in the groups, for L. truncatula as well as for the other
     snaïl species. The penetration site of the miraci- dium in the snail was the mantle (23 to 44
     %), the tentacles (7 to 23 7%), and the foot (4 to 11 Z); the site could not be specified in
     39-45 % of adults, and in 34 to 65 % of young snails, whatever the species. The tunnel-shaped
     lacunae were more numerous in adult and juvenile L. truncatula; they can be observed in the
     digestive gland and in the gonad of snails. In the other species, the lacunae were present only
     in the mantle, in the ten- tacles, and in the foot. The authors assume that the miracidium of
     F. hepatica could penetrate in all the snail species, but only the snail quality would permit
     the further development of the parasite in its host? S10.C 47 P.</p>

    <p>1,200 adult Lymnaea truncatula, 4 mm in height, have been individually exposed to 3-4 mi-
     racidia of Fasciola gigantica for studying the cercarial sheddings. The snails have been raised
     at 23° C up to day 30 postexposure; afterwards, they have been isolated in small Petri dishes,
     35 mm in diameter, with 2 ml of water and a watercress-leaf per container.</p>
    <p>Only, 61.7 7% of exposed snaïils survived at day 30 and 27.5 % showed living parthenitae
     under the shell when observed under stereomicroscope. The duration of prepatent.period was
     41-73 days (52 days average). 14.7 % of L. truncatula were infected but died without cercarial
     sheddings. 7.3 % of molluscs produced their cercariae for 1 or 2 days between days 41 and 57
     postexposure and afterwards died; the number of shed parasites was 1-38.</p>
    <p>The last 5.5 % snails shed their cercariae during longer times and the mean number of
     parasites produced per snail increased after day 50 postexposure, with maxima between days 60
     and 80. The highest number of cercariae produced per snail and per day was 114.</p>
    <p>No infradian-type rhythm in the cercarial sheddings of F. gigantica was noted in these
     experiments. Most cercariae were produced during the night with a maximum number from 23 to 3
     hours, indicating the existence of a circadian-type rhythm. 68.4 7% of metacerca- riae counted
     in the Petri dishes were fixed and the other 31.6 % were floating. These results can be
     explaïned by the role of L. truncatula as an accidental intermediate host in the life cycle of

    <p>Malaria vectors in Madagascar namely An.funestus, An.gambiae and An.arabiensis, vere studied
     from 1986 to 1989 in various localities both on the coast and on the highlands. The following
     parameters were considered: man biting rate, human blood index altitudes lower than 1000 m. CS
     positivity around 2% and HBI higher than 0,90 were repeatedly recorded for this species,
     An.funestus exhibited partially exophilic and zoophilic behaviour in localities of the
     highlands and of the West Coast suggesting heterogeneities in this taxon. CS-positive specimens
     (2-3%) were recorded in samples from the East Coast and from the Mandoto area, Very low
     densities were generally observed in Antananarivo area, An.arabiensis shows polytene chromosome
     sequences similar to those of the East Coast of Africa but it is clearly more zoophilic and
     exophilic, This taxon is widespread in Madagascar and it has successfully adapted to the
     highland environment, with high densities due to larval breeding associated to rice
     cultivation, In the Antananarivo area the man biting rate per night reached values up to 15 in
     some localities, The global HBI was estimated to be lower than 0,05 in human settlements “here
     domestic animals (bovids) are abundant, Very few specimens were collected in bed rooms and,
     even in this subsample, the HBI was as low as 0,25, However fairly high parous rates (PS0.80)
     were recorded, and in spite of high exophily and low night temperatures, the sporogonic cycle
     is likely to be successfully completed in at least a fraction of the mosquito population
     resting in animal sheds,. The total CS positivity inde“ of An.arabiensis in the Antananarivo
     area was found to be 0.08% (3/3,824), S10.C 43 P.</p>

    <p>Histological results were obtained by azan- and silverstaining. Differences concerning a
     certain degree of destruction of the intestinal epithelium had not been observed between
     feeding with or without B. burgdorferi. But there were clear differences in the amount of
     secretion droplets: infected ticks showed a distinct increase of secretion droplets in the
     intestinal lumen and in the epithelium as well 100 hrs p.i. whereas the qut of uninfected ticks
     was inconspicuous.</p>
    <p>These experiments only could be performed successfully by developing à new method in keeping

     Dakar, Sénégal Malaria - Epidemiology - Vectors - Urbanization - Africa - In a previous study,
     we have shown that the heterogeneity of malaria endemicity in urban areas of Central Africa
     derives from two main factors resulting from urbanization. By absorbing the last remaining open
     spaces and by increasing pollution, urbanization tends to eliminate anopheline breeding places.
     Secondly, by limiting the dispersion of anophelines from breeding sites, urbanization tends to
     focus malaria transmission (Trape et al., 1987). The impact of these mechanisms on vectorial
     density and the level of exposure to malaria in Senegal was studied over a 17-month period in
     Pikine, a suburb of Dakar were malaria is almost exclusively transmitted by Anopheles
     arabiensis.</p>
    <p>Pvrethrum spray collections were carried out along a 910-metre transect starting from a
     district bordering on a permanent marsh and continuing into the center of the town. 3,404 rooms
     were visited.</p>
    <p>The total number of mosquitoes collected was 26,174 (18,128 99 and 8,046 dd) among which were
     2,648 anophelines (2,440 gg and 208 dd). These were 2,632 An. gambiae s.i. (- An. arabiensis)
     (2,424 gg and 208 66) and 16 An. pharoensis. According to the distance from the marsh, vector
     density (no. of An. gambiae s.l. gg / 100 rooms) at 0-160, 160-285, 285-410, 410-535, 535-660,
     660-785, 785-910 metres, respectivel#, was 84, 40, 5, 2, 2, 0.4 and O during the dry season,
     and 414, 229, 110, 84, 99, 69 and 21 during the rainy season. The density of Culex
     quinquefasciatus (12,348 Q9), respectively, was 255, 375, 533, 582, 297, 244 and 226 during the
     dry season, and 210, 263, 383, 358, 346, 468 and 554 during the rainy season. Although vector
     density gradients are less pronounced during the rainy season, these results show that in all
     seasons the level of exposure to malaria varies considerably according to the distance from
     breeding sites. The existence of such important differences between adjacent areas with
     homogeneous populations is of great interest for the study of numerous epidemiological,
     clinical and immunological aspects of malaria in tropical Africa.</p>

    <p>lectins, tryvpanosome, tsetse, sleeping sickness Two lectins have been reported in tsetse, a
     midgut lectin with glucosamine specificitv, and a haemolvmph lectin with melibiose specificity.
     Inhibition of the midgut lectin by addition of glucosamine to the infective feed prevents this
     lectin performing its normal role of killing tryvpanosomes in the gut lumen - all flies
     becoming infected in the midgut. This lectin is also responsible for trypanosome
     differentiation in the flv as continuous inhibition of its activitv prevents the subsequent
     maturation of both T. b. brucei, T. b. rhodesiense and T. congolense infections.</p>
    <p>The haemolymph lectin has also been shown to have a role in trypanosome maturation;
     continuous inhibition of this lectin significantly decreases maturation of T. b.</p>
    <p>rhodesiense and T. congolense infections, while having no effect on midgut establishment.</p>
    <p>The maturation response of midgut trvpanosomes to lectin stimulation varies between species
     and between stocks of the same trypanosome species, probably reflecting differences in numbers
     of lectin binding sites which are determined bv trvpanosome genotypes.</p>

    <p>Rhipicephalus bursa (R.b.) is the main vector of sheep babesiosis in Israel.</p>

     incidence of B. ovis in sheep during this period, corresponding to the occurrence of larvae and
     nymphs of R. b. which were shown to transmit the parasite causing often, a mild disease
     apparently due to the low infection rate of the ticks. Such sub-clinical reactions might confer
     immunity to the sheep before the main tick exposure in summer. The rates of tick (haemoloymph)
     and egg infection with B. ovis are directly related to the level of parasitaemia of the sheep

    <p>Our aïm was to study the reasons for the formation of breeding sites of blood-sucking
     mosquitoes and ellaborate the complex of differential con- trol measures in the conditions of
     development of new lands in Uzbekis- tan. We carried out an entomological investigation of
     different types of water reservoirs, determined fauna and density of mosquito population The
     main breeding sites of mosquitoes are: small irrigation and drinage systems, reservoirs along
     the irrigation mains, cuvettes along the ro- ads, puddles and floods, holes and diggings,
     swamps and boggings, rice fields e.t.c.The reasons for the formation of water reservoirs are:
     mi- stakes in construction and exploitation of irrigation systems, in irri- gation of
     agricultural crops, construction of the roads, planning of lands under cultivation and
     settlements, in public water use. In order to sanitate the territory a complex of special
     control measures has to be conducted such as: land reclamation, sanitary-hydrotechnical, anni-
     hilative and protective. In conditions of Uzbekistan where the formati- on of most of the water
     reservoirs - the breeding sites of blood-sucking insects is connected with economic activity of
     man strategy of control includes the steady sanitation of the environment. That is why for the
     protection of people and animals against blooë-sucking insects it is obligatory to conduct
     systematic and methodical annihilative and prote tive measures.</p>

     burgdorferi culture medium (BSK II, 1x10$-1x10$Borreliae ner ml) using glass capillaries for 4h
     at 35°C and 957 relative hunidity.Fully fed ticks were kept at 20°C and 907 relative humidity.
     The infected ticks were then fixed at different intervals until 4 days after artificial
     infection. Modified Dieterle snirochete stain was used to visualize snirochetes.</p>
    <p>At about 1 day post-artificial infection, countless spirochetes were observed in the terminal
     oarts of the two hind pairs of diverticula, while many spirochetes had attached to the midgut
     epithelial cell surface and some had penetrated into the intercellular spaces of the midgut
     wall. Only a few snirochetes could be found in the midgut lumen, which were not in contact with
     the mideut wall, at about 1 day after the infection. In ticks fixed at 3-4 days post-infection,
     most parts of the midgut lumen had disavpeared and spirochetes were found embedded in the
     microvilli of the midgut epithelium. But in the remains of the midgut lumen spirochetes were
     distributed randomly. Snirochetes were also detedted in the rectum and rectal ampulla of ticks
     fixed at 1-4 days post-infection.</p>
    <p>Our results confirm that the terminal narts of the two hind diverticula of Ixodes ricinus

    <p>The present method of control of East Coast Fever(ECF) in Kenya is bÿ an immunisation
     procedure termed Infection and Treatment method, coupled with intensive use of acaricide by
     weekly dinping.This method is not onlÿ expensive but dip management is poor.The purpose of the
     study is to look into the possibilities of developing a model for the cost effective control of
     ticks in both immunised and unimmunised cattle.The experimental protocool involves looking at
     the effect of varying the intensity of tick control on ticks and livestock productivity in
     terms of milk in dairy animals and liveweight gains in beef animals.</p>
    <p>The preliminary result(after 12 months) show that for dairy cattle,the milk production of the
     group under once in six weeks dipping regime is not significantly different from the control
     group which are dipned weekly.For beef cattle,those that are dipped fortnightly gained 22.2kg
     as against 21.3kg for the control group.</p>
    <p>Though the study is still in progress, there is a promise of a cost effeectve alternative to
     the current weekly dipping.This alternative model will invariably depend on several factors
     like the level of tick challenge prevalent in the study sites and tie incidence of tick borne
     diseases within the various dipping groups 1192 S10.D - Lutte antivectorielle.</p>

    <p>Ces essais ont concerné 37 campements situés dans la zone agro-pastorale (ZAGROP) de Yérémo.
     Ils regroupent 114 éleveurs et leurs familles (Djafoun essentiellement), soit environ 8000
     têtes de bétail (zébu Mbororo rouge). A partir de décembre 1987, les éleveurs ont installés les
     pièges dans les galeries forestières, à l’emplacement des abreuvoirs à bétail. Leur
     participation consistait à tuer manuellement et collecter chaque jour les glossines piégées et
     à entretenir les pièges. L'extension de la lutte s’est faite selon une progression dictée par
     la demande des éleveurs. En 1989, 159 pièges étaient répartis dans 66 abreuvoirs, soit environ
     2 par abreuvoir et 4 par campement. À la fin du mois de juillet 1989, 17777 G.fuscipes avaient
     été détruites et comptées. Les densités initiales, qui Variaient entre 3 et 13 glossines
     capturées par piège et par jour dans les abreuvoirs les plus exposés, sont devenues inférieures
     à 1 dans un délais de 1 à 4 mois après l’installation des pièges. Ces résultats semblent
     indiquer que ce type de lutte est suffisant pour permettre une réduction de la pres- sion
     glossinienne dans ce contexte. Il reste à déterminer précisément son impact épi- zootiologique
     et l’intérêt économique d’une telle lutte par rapport à l’achat de médi- caments

     fed females of An.pharoensis and An.gambiae s.1, were collected during Septem- ber-December
     1987 from mosquito bed nets in the village of Souhloul, near the PBoundoum dam, 70 km NE of
     St.Louis, The samples were kept dry, the mosquitoes were identified and their thorax processed
     with MAb against the circumsporozoite (CS) protein of P.falciparum. Five An.pharoensis out of
     912 examined were found positive, The positive specimens were collected in September (1), in
     October (1) and in November (3), The ELISA-positive OD values were 0.49, 0,35 and 0.81, 1,10,
     1.19. All are unquestionable, since the means of the negative controls were 0.08, 0.09 and
     0,15, respectively. Ninety eight An.gambiae s.1. (including both gambise s.s. and arabiensis)
     from the same samples “ere all negative. Blood meal identification was carried out on 384
     An.pharoensis, As expected, most of them (91%) were positive for human blood, These data
     support the hypothesis that An:pharoensis is an important contributar to the transmission of
     P.falciparum in the Senegal river delta. The finding of 5 CS-positive specimens, their
     distribution in time and the scarcity of the main malaria vectors, i.e. An.gambiae and
     An.arabiensis, strongly support the involvement of An.pharoensis in the maintenance of local
     P.falciparum malaria. The presence of different sibling species within the taxon An.pharoensis
     should be taken into account. The Senegal river delta would thus represent a peculiar
     eco-epidemiological stratum in subsaharian Africa, Such peculiarity appears to be confirmed by
     the remarkable impact on malaria transmission obtained through the use of
     deltamethrin-impregnated bed nets, which allowed more than 90% decrease in parasite prevalence

     Anopheles stephensi Bednets impregnated with pyrethroids, such as permethrin or deltamethrin,
     are showing good results against malaria mosqitoes in many countries. These successes might be
     threatened if pyrethroid resistance evolves in the target populations. To assess this threat, a
     pyrethroid resistant strain of Anopheles stephensi was compared with a susceptible strain in a
     realistic situation with a human host inside an impregnated or unimpregnated net. The
     resistance gave limited protection to the mosquitoes against the toxic effects of the
     ïinsecticide, but the impregnated netting was much more effective than unimpregnated netting in
     protecting the host against the resistant strain. Selective breeding from mated females which
     penetrated impregnated netting has not increased the level of pyrethroid resistance, whereas
     this level could readily be increased by conventional selection on both males and females
     exposed to permethrin impregnated paper. It seems that the threat of pyrethroiïid resistance to
     impregnated net programmes may not be as sevère as it first appeared to be.</p>

    <p>Ivermectin - Malaria transmission - Anophelines Ivermectin is a new drug, videly used for
     treatment of ectoparasitic arthropodes and endoparasitic nematodes of lifestock and humans. We
     have investigated the effect of Ivomec Mk-993 on hsematophagous sanophelines, and particularly
     the remanence of toxic levels of the drug in the blood of various laboratory mammals. À long
     lasting toxicity to vectors of plasmodia vould make it suitable for the interruption of malaria
     transmission.</p>
    <p>Membrane-fed mosquitoes die if they take blood containing at least 0.01 g per ml blood, À
     total of 0.0002 pg appeared to be lethal to mosquitoes.</p>
    <p>Mice fed on Ivomec containing food (2 mg/kg) for one or several days vere thereafter put on
     normal food and mosquitoes vere alloved to feed daily. The drug did not deter mosquitoes from
     feeding. Mortality was 100% for the first 2-5 days, thereafter it declined rapidly. It appeared
     that the toxic level vas not maintained beyond 8 fev days.</p>
    <p>Surviving mosquitoes shoved no decrease in reproductivity.</p>
    <p>Similar survival patterns vere found in mosquitoes fed on rats receiving 0.4 hg per os and
     rabbits with 3 ml in their drinking water. Also the blood of Java monkeys that had ingested 200
     hg, lost its activity after a fev days.</p>
    <p>À single dose Ivermectin, as used in Onchocerca control is expected to kill feeding
     mosquitoes only for a fev days. À veekly dose would cause a more permanent effect but such an
     approach seems unrealistic, both from ethical and practical standpoints.</p>

    <p>Devant les risques d'onchocercose encourus par les réfugiés tchadiens d'un camp implanté dans
     une zone hyperendémique de savane du Nord-Cameroun, les auteurs ont mené, pendant les 4 à 5
     mois de la période de transmission, une campagne de lut- te antivectorielle dirigée contre les
     larves de simulies situées sur des petits affluents saisonniers du fleuve principal de cette
     région.</p>
    <p>Les opérations se sont déroulées sur deux saisons des pluies consécutives.</p>
    <p>La première année a consisté à mettre au point les techniques de lutte par voie terrestre et
     à évaluer l'efficacité de l'insecticide. La seconde année a été plus particulièrement consacrée
     à étudier l'impact de la lutte antivectorielle sur le taux de piqûres et la transmission de
     l'onchocercose.</p>
    <p>Trois des affluents les plus proches du camp ont été traités chaque semaine avec un concentré
     émulsifiable de téméphos. Sur l'ensemble de la saison des pluies, ces traitements ont abaissé,
     en un point d'hyperendémicité onchocerquienne, le taux de piqûres de 60% et le Potentiel Annuel
     de Transmission de 727, soit des valeurs correspondant au seuil inférieur de la
     mésoendémicité.</p>
    <p>Considérant que ces résultats ont été obtenus en un point très défavorable du point de vue de
     la densité simulidienne et de la transmission de l'onchocercose, les auteurs estiment qu'une

    <p>BEHAVIOURAL EFFECTS OF ADULTICIDES ON MOSQUITOES EXAMINED BY CAGE TEST METHOD T.Kurihara.
     Teikyo University School of Medicine, Kaga, Itabashi, Tokyo 173,JAPAN Wide-mesh net,
     Pyrethroids, Mosquito behaviour In order to assess the behaviour of mosquitoes under the
     influence of insecticides, a series of cage tests was carried out. A piece of wide-mesh (10 mm)
     net impregnated with an insecticide was interposed between two wire-cages, one containing
     hungry mosquitoes and the other a bait animal. Mosquitoes could pass the netting and feed on
     the bait animal. Three different pyrethroids; permethrin, phenothrin and cyphenothrin, were
     individually impregnated on the netting.</p>
    <p>The lethal activities of these insecticides were prominent and showed rapid knockdown against
     Anopheles stephensi as far as examined by contact bioassay method. However, mortality never
     reached to 100 % using the cage test method, because the mosquitoes could fly freely and had
     the option of avoiding the netting. With insecticide treatment of 0.64 g/sq.m., about 30 % of
     the mosquitoes were still alive in the release cage at 4 weeks after impregnation. About the
     same survival rate was still noted the 20th week.</p>
    <p>Among these three tested chemicals, the lethal activity of permethrin was somewhat superior
     and was stable for 20 weeks.</p>
    <p>Insecticidal activity of phenothrin was studied using six different populations of
     mosquitoes, and the mortality rates did not greatly vary among populations. The majority of
     mosquitoes survived a dose of upto 0.4 g. À dose of more than 2.5 q killed most but not all,
     and some survived in the release cage. The percentage surviving in the release cage, however,
     differed among populations, and seemed to be higher in the case of more susceptible mosquitoes
     and lower for less susceptible ones.</p>

    <p>We assayed at the laboratory the toxic effect of defibrinated sheeps blood containing
     synthetic insecticides, offered as source meal to triatomines in non-lubrificated latex condoms
     kept at room-temperature. The tests were based on the evidence that those insects feed easily
     in artificial devices. The insects were placed ïin glass flasks coated with filter paper where
     the condom were hangeä for one week. The tested insecticides were BHC (Ciclohexane, 1,2,3,4,5,6
     - hexacloro) at 1.334g/1; DDT; at 1.334 g/l; Thrichiorton, at 1.002/g/1; Malathion at 1.075
     g/1. The tests were performed on six of the main Trypanosom cruzi transmiting species in South
     America: Triatom infestans, Panstrongylus mgistus, Rhodnius prolixus, T. brasiliensis, and T.
     pseudomculata.</p>
    <p>Among the four tested insecticides, BHC showed to be most effective by the oral route,
     killing 100% of the insects during the test period except for P. mqgistus (95,7%).</p>
    <p>Thrichlorfon eliminated between 69,9% of T. infestans and 95% of T. pseudomculata.</p>
    <p>Malathion remained slightly behind, killing between 58,3% of R. prolixus and 97% of T.
     brasiliensis. DDT was the least effective, killing between 7,5% of T. vitticeps) and 69,2% of
     T. brasiliensis.</p>

    <p>Baseline information on clinical, parasitological as well as entomological data on malaria
     vectors; Anopheles gambiae s.1. and Anopheles funestus was collected for a year, intervention
     was introduced in the subsequent years. Sampling was carried out fortnightly in each of the
     paired villages. Results on clinical and parasitological data are reported elsewhere.</p>
    <p>Mosquitoes were mainly collected by light traps in selected bedrooms. Other collections were
     by indoor handcatches, pyrethrum spraycatch and in pit traps. Dissections were carried out to
     examine ovaries for parity and age grading done by counting the number of dilatations on the
     ovariolar stalks (Polovodova). Salivary glands were examined for sporozoites.</p>
    <p>Sporozoite rates were found to be between 3 and 12% before intervention. The rates were
     reduced to between 0 and 2% in the treated villages. Permethrin treatment of bednets was found
     to drastically reduce mosquito densities which however, varied between the villages by large
     factors. Very few mosquitoes were found resting in rooms with treated bednets. No increase was
     observed in outdoor resting densities.</p>
    <p>The mean survival rates of the vectors were markedlyÿy reduced. Bioassays on clean
     impregnated bednets showed a kill of 80% even after six months of use.</p>

     signalaient la résistance de A.gambiae à la dieldrine dans la région de Antananarivo. Suite à
     une recrudescence du paludisme, depuis 1984 sur les hautes-terres, un programme de recherche
     pour le contrôle de cette maladie à été financé par la coopération italienne. Une campagne de
     traitements intradomiciliaires sur les hautes-terres, menée par le Ministère de la Santé en
     collaboration avec l'Organisation Mondiale de la Santé, à débuté en 1988. Dans le cadre de ces
     activités, des essais de laboratoire ont été menés afin de déterminer les niveaux de
     sensibilité aux insecticides des vecteurs Anopheles gambiae s.1. et A.funestus. Les tests ont
     été effectués en 1988 et 1989, selon les méthodes standards O.M.S. sur des femelles gorgées
     récoltées en diverses occasions, lors de captures effectuées pour l'étude de la faune

    <p>Permethrin - Sandflies - Impregnated nets A limited number of field studies on efficacy of
     permethrin-impregnated nets against vectors of leishmaniasis has been carried out. In Italy it
     has been demonstrated that permethrin-impregnated nets around windows and around CDC
     light-traps, reduce the number of sandflies (Phlebotomus perfiliewi) entering the stables and
     traps. Moreover, in Burkina Faso, indoor use of wide-meshs cotton curtains impregnated with
     permethrin completely eliminates the occurrence of endophilic sandfly species. We report here
     the laboratory results of permethrin-impregnated curtains at 1 g/m2 tested in experimental
     tunnel against two endophilic sandfly species, P. perniciosus and P.</p>
    <p>papatasi, exposed for 1 h. The efficacy of permethrin was investigated by studing: i) the
     irritant or repellent effect; ii) the influence on feeding behavior; iii) the mortality rate
     1lh and 24h after the contact with the treated-curtain. In three replicates a reduction of
     passing through the treated net of only 14.1% was obtained in P. perniciosus, while in P.
     papatasi no prevention from passing was observed. The ‘reduction of biting rate in P.
     perniciosus and P. papatasi was respectively of 51.2% and 18.2%. The mortality rate after 1h
     for both species was less than 20% and after 24h was 81.0% for P. perniciosus and 97.0% for P.
     papatasi. From the present and previous results, it seems that permethrin shows low or any
     barrier effect agaïnst the two sandfly species, and that the high mortality and reduction of
     biting rate observed are the main toxic effects that make permethrin-impregnated nets very
     effective for vector control.</p>

     ABSTRACT: Two populations of the Anopheles gambiae complex, An. gambiae (sensu stricto) in the
     Muheza district and An.</p>
    <p>arabiensis in the Mombo - Korogwe district, Tanzania, were compared in their response to
     residual house spraying of DDT and Lambdacyhalothrin (ICON) for malaria control. The former
     population is less polymorphic for chromosomal inversion 2R and is more endophilic and
     anthropophilic than the latter.</p>
    <p>Malaria in children aged between 1 and 10 years was assessed by taking temperatures and blood
     slides, and mosquitoes mere collected fortnightly before and after intervention for
     determinations of sporozoites, parity, species identity, chromosome inversions, resting
     behaviour and source of blood meals.</p>
    <p>In both populations; mosquito densities, sporozoite and parity rates and the percentage of
     children with fever and high parasitaemia (7100 parasites/200 leucocytes) were reduced markedly
     with both insecticides. However significant reduction in the geometric mean of malaria parasite
     densities in children was only observed in the arabiensis population.</p>
    <p>These results are contrary to the general expectation that reduction in malaria transmission
     by residual house spraying is easier with an endophilic/anthropophilic and a Less chromosomal
     polymorphic population, and suggest that other factors may be equally important.</p>

    <p>La survie de Glossina m. morsitans gravides d'élevage a été étudiée en fonction de deux
     facteurs : le parasitisme à Trypanosoma congolense et l'exposition à différentes doses, d'un
     insecticide pyréthrinoïde de synthèse, la deltaméthrine.</p>
    <p>La pathogénicité du trypanosome pour son vecteur est nettement démontrée : il réduit sa
     survie d'un facteur supérieur à 2,5. D'autre part, on observe cette nocivité parasitaire chez
     les mouches exposées à l'insecticide : pour chaque dose, on note une mortalité
     significativement supérieure chez les glossines parasitées. Cependant, une interaction est
     manifeste : le rapport de risque mouches infectées/ mouches non infectées dépend de la
     dose.</p>
    <p>Les conséquences de ces résultats sur la stratégie de lutte contre les trypanoso- moses sont
     discutées.</p>

     Sensibilité - Tiques - Bovins - Bénin L'infestation des bovins toujours importante malgré
     l'utilisation de plus en plus grandissant des acaricides a motivé l'étude de la sensibilité des
     tiques vis à vis des acaricides utilisés au Bénin.</p>
    <p>Ce travail à été mené dans la Province de Borgou berceau de l'élevage au Bénin. Les tiques
     utilisées dans ce test sont Amblyomma variegatum, Hyalomma marginatum rufipes et Boophilus
     geïgyi. Elle proviennent d'une part de la ferme d'état d'Okpara et d'autre part des éleva- ges
     paysans. Le calcul des LD50 pour les différentes espèces fait apparaître l'existence d'une
     resistance marquée des Amblyomma variegatum et Hyalomma marginatum rufipes dans la ferme
     d'Okpara au Coumaphos, Deldrin et Diazinon. Tandis que dans les élevages paysan seules les A.
     vairegatum présentent un niveau élevé de résistance au Diazinon.</p>
    <p>Ces phénomènes de résistance constituent ainsi un handicap sérieux pour le contrôle des

    <p>Cette étude confirme l'efficacité déjà connue ailleurs du Bayticol Pour on. Son utilisa- tion
     très facile, sans apport d'eau, fait de ce produit l'acaricide par excellence pour les zones où
     le problème de l'eau se pose ävec acuité. Son utilisation, une fois par mois, suffit à protéger
     les bovins en toute saison contre les tiques, entrainant ainsi la diminution des coûts de

     anti-vectorielle Le Programme de Lutte contre l'Onchocercose en Afrique de l'Ouest regroupe
     actuellement 11 pays participants. Il couvre 1.350.000 km2 et 50.000 km de rivières sont
     inclus, dans les zones d'opérations. Le but du Programme est d'interrompre la transmission de
     la maladie en détruisant les larves du vecteur qui vivent dans l'eau courante. Depuis 15 ans,
     les gîtes larvaires des simulies sont traités chaque semaine par avions et héli- coptères. Les
     résultats obtenus par cette lutte anti-vectorielle sont impressionnants puisque dès à présent
     près de 500.000 km2 de la zone initiale sont assainis et que la culture et l'élevage ont. pu
     reprendre sur près de 18.000 km de vallées fertiles autre- fois désertées. Dans de nombreux
     villages où la prévalence de la maladie dépassait 90 %, celle-ci est réduite pratiquement à
     zéro. En conséquence, les 23 pays et organismes donateurs ont accepté de poursuivre le
     financement de ce Programme jusqu'à l'élimination du réservoir de parasites chez l'homme dans
     les zones d'extension, soit 14 années supplémentaires, durée maximale de vie des vers

     Guinea; *xMalaria Control Service, Ministry of Health, Vanuatu.</p>
    <p>Studies on Anopheles farauti, the main vector mosquitos of both falciparum and vivax malaria
     in South Pacific islands were carried out in Vanuatu and Papua New Guinea during the period of
     1986-1988. The results are summarized as follows: (1) Human biting collections at Santo,
     Vanuatu showed that 39.3% of An. farauti was collected in 18:00-22:00 hours and 60.7% after
     22:00 hours, during which time the most villagers are used to sleeping inside the house. The
     peak time of the feeding activity was 20:00-22:00 hours. Biting ratio of indoors to outdoors
     was 1 to 1.5 in March and 1 to 0.6 in August.</p>
    <p>(2) Larvae of An. farauti were found all the breeding sources available, except artificial
     containers, and no larvae were collected where Gambusia fish were well estab- lished. More An.
     farauti larvae were found in stagnant water sources, rather than streams in west Santo, whereas
     they were more likely found bred in streams and creeks when availa- ble in South Santo and
     elsewhere.</p>
    <p>(3) Field evaluation on the application of permethrin-impregnated mosquito nets (at the
     dosage of 0.5g/m‘) for malaria control t'as carried out in the Vanapa area, Central Pro- vince,
     Papua New Geinea. The reduction rates of 65.9%, 72.2% and 100% respectively for An.</p>
    <p>farauti, An. koliensis and An. punctulatus were given. The results of the mass blood sur-
     veys showed 25.4% reduction of parasite rate after 7 months of the treatment and 67.9% after 14
     months in the all-age« group, and 84.0% reduction after 7 months and 79.4% after 14 months in
     children under 5 years old.</p>

     food Role of cyanobacteria and algae - possible carriers of Bacillus thuringiensis H-14 genes -
     in mosauito larvae food was studied by means of LM. In dissected larvae guts of Aedes cantans,
     Ae. vexans, Culex pi- piens, Anopheles sp., Culiseta annulata etc. more than 30 algal genera
     and only a few cyanobacterial genera were found. Mosquito larvae feeding behaviour does not
     basically influence the variety of swallowed algal species. In mosquito guts sessil svecies of
     algae were found to predomi- nate. Free living algal species were found in guts if the sessil
     species were absent /or very rare/, or when density of free living algae in water was high.
     Many cyanobacteria and algae are digestible for mosquito larvae while spores or zytoges and
     vegetative stages possessing jelly envelopes /e.g. Chroococcus sp., Oocystis sp./, or the cell
     wall with sporopollenin /e.g. Scenedesmus sp., Chlorella sp., Monoravhidium sp., Kirchneriella
     sp.</p>
    <p>etc./ tended to pass undamaged by the digestive process. Laboratory observations and
     observations of intestinal contents of mosquito larvae caught in the field showed that larvae
     of the same species but with different food choice, or in a critical situation of hunger, can
     at least partly digest the algal species with sporopollenin or with jely envelope.</p>
    <p>A cyanobacterium Phormidium splendidum culture was introduced to an artificial mosquito
     breeding place and its ingestion by Aedes, Culex and Anopheles larvae was observed.</p>

    <p>Le village "Vallée du Kou n°4“, au centre d'une rizière dans le sud-ouest du Burkina Faso
     abrite 900 personnes et présente une haute densité d’anophèles vecteurs de paludisme humain. Il
     a servi de cadre à une expérimentation anti paludique basée uniquement sur l'imprégnation par
     pulvérisation d'un pyréthrinoïde, la deltaméthrine, à la dose de 25 mg de matière active par m?
     de tissu.</p>
    <p>L'étude a duré trois ans de mai 1985 à avril 1988. La 1È'€ année a permis le recueil des
     données de prétraitement alors que tous les habitants utilisaient déjà leurs propres
     moustiquaires. Au début de la 2°M€ année les moustiquaires d'une moitié du village ont été
     imprégnées.</p>
    <p>Au début de la 3M€ année toutes les moustiquaires du village ont été imprégnées.</p>
    <p>La transmission du paludisme a été estimée à partir de 156 nuits de capture de moustiques sur
     sujets humains n'utilisant pas de moustiquaires. Au total plus de 1000 ’hommes-nuits“ de
     capture ont permis la collecte de plus de 50000 moustiques ; 80% étaient des anophèles dont
     16146 ont été disséqués pour rechercher la présence de sporozoïtes dans les glandes
     salivaires.</p>
    <p>La 1€T€ année, la transmission du paludisme était assurée à 90% par Anopheles gambiae s.s. et
     à 10% par À. funestus. Le taux annuel d'inoculation était de 55 piqûres infectées par
     homme.</p>
    <p>La 2°M€ année le taux annuel d’inoculation était de 70 faisant apparaître l'inefficacité de
     l'imprégnation des moustiquaires d'une moitié du village (les 27% d'augmentation de ce taux
     sont probablement dus à des modifications dans le cycle de la riziculture).</p>
    <p>La 3°M€ année l'avantage des moustiquaires imprégnées est apparu par rapport aux
     moustiquaires simples : le taux annuel d'inoculation était tombé à 3 piqûres infectées par
     homme (soit 94% de réduction par rapport à l'année témoin). Cette réduction de l'infectivité
     des anophèles vecteurs était due à une baisse de la densité (-61% pour le taux de piqûre) et de
     la longévité (-30% pour le taux de parturité d'A. gambiae ). Aucun À. gambiae n'a été trouvé
     infecté sur 2940 glandes salivaires disséquées (s-0%) alors que lors de la 1°T€ année 15
     positifs sur 7 701 ont été observés (s=0,20%). Seul 1 À. funestus, probablement originaire de
     l'extérieur de la rizière, a été trouvé positif au cours de la 3ME année.</p>

    <p>Insecticides utilised in the field to control tsetse flies often do not reach thier targets
     in sufficient quantities to kill them. The effects of such sublethal doses on the reproduction
     of these flies is therefore important in assessing the fly population dynamics after spray
     applications.</p>
    <p>The influence of pyethroids, topically applied on the females of Glossina pallidipes Austen
     and G.morsitans morsitans West, were investigated.</p>
    <p>There was a depression in the feeding behaviour and several types of reproductive
     abnormalities were observed. The significance of sublethal effects of insecticides is discussed
     in relation to population dynamics and future control strategies.</p>

     most important vector of Japanese encephalitis virus in Japan is Culex tritaeniorhynchus Giles
     ( C. t.), which principally breeds in rice fields. Recently, a pyrethroid resistant strain,
     Chinen, of C. t. was found in Okinawa, a southern island of Japan. The Chinen adults showed 62
     times resistant to permethrin than the susceptible adults. We confirmed nerve insensitivity to
     permethrin in the Chinen strain by the electrophysiological method. The abdomen of adult
     mosquito was surgically operated and the abdominal nerve cord was exposed.</p>
    <p>After direct application of a permethrin solution to the nerve cord, spontaneous discharge
     was recorded from the nerve cord using a suction electrode until it disappears. It took about 4
     min for disappearance of the spontaneous discharge in the susceptible strain after application
     of 2.5 X 10 - M permethrin, wheareas it took about 10 min in the Chinen strain. The
     relationship between permethrin concentration and the time for disappearance of the spontaneous
     discharge showed that the central nervous system of the Chinen is 10 times.less sensitive to
     permethrin than that of the susceptible. Nerve insensitivity to the pyrethroid found in the
     Chinen strain of C. t. is generally called kdr mechanism, which is the most important mechanism
     of pyrethroid resistance in many insect pests.</p>

    <p>The paper describes work carried out in Australia with the new benzoylphenyl urea acarine
     growth regulator CGA 157419. The performance of the compound, when given either orally,
     dermally or by sub-cutaneous injection, was examined under stall trial conditions with cattle
     infested with Boophilus microplus. Efficacy of the compound is achieved by both curative and
     prophylactic actions on the tick infestations. Better than 99 % curative control and more than
     3 months prophalyctic protection were found with cattle sprayed with the compound dispersed in
     water at a concentration of 500 mg/L. Similar control was achieved when the compound was given
     orally at the rate of 10 mg/kg, thus focusing on the systemic aspect of the compound's action
     on infested cattle. Variable efficacy resulted from the pour-on application of the compound at
     rates between 1 and 5 mg/kg.</p>
    <p>More controlled efficacy can be achieved when the compound is given to calves by sub-
     cutaneous injection at the dose of 1 mg/kg. At therapeutic rates of treatment, larval and
     nymphal ticks exposed to the compound fail to develop to the next instar. Depending upon their
     exposure, adult female ticks may either fail to produce eggs, may produce abnormal eggs or may
     produce eggs in which the embryos develop but fail to hatch.</p>

    <p>Previous studies of the biochemical mode of action of A-endotoxin Bti showed some significant
     alterations of functional relationships (free amino-acids;lipids/carbo- hydrates). We present
     the experimental results about relationships between haemo- lymph free amino-acids and
     carbohydrates of larval A.aegypti (4th instar); the kinetics were surveyed by chromatography
     technics.</p>
    <p>Highly significant correlations,reflecting the metabolic pathway of the TCA cycle,up to
     d-cetoglutarate biosynthesis,have been evidenced in healthy larvae.The pool
     (glutamate+glutamine) is linked to either glucose(f =0.68;N=25;P-0.0005)or trehalose
     (P=0.69;N=20;P=0.0007)with respective regression slopes:b=0.65+t0.15 and b=0.11+ 0.02. _
     Following administration of 0.01/0.02/0.1/1.0 mg.1l of toxin (12,000 IU per mg), the
     correlation versus glucose exhibits a progrpssive decrease of the slope,down to a negative
     value(b=0.15+0.03) at 0.1 mg.l of toxin.Then at maximum dose,the regression slope increases
     back to a positive value (b=0.46t0.21)not significantly different from the control one.By
     contrast,the regression slope of the relationships between (glytamate+glutamine) and trehalose
     remains almost constant from dose zero to O.1mg.1 (B=0.11#0.04),but exhibits a very important
     increase under the stress of the highest dose (b=0.46+0.21).</p>
    <p>The involved metabolic connexions are thus adversely affected by the toxin at low
     doses,whereas an apparently normal pattern is restored at the highest dose,in the case of
     glucose.By contrast,the involvement of trehalose seems to be altered only at the highest dose.
     In both cases,dose/effect relationships are not linear.</p>

    <p>Molluscicide, Tetrapleura tetraptera, snails A schistosomiasis research project, carried out
     in part of tre boutn West area of Nigeria, yielded data by which it was possible to relate
     snail intermediate hosts of schistosomiasis recovery from potential transmission sites to the
     vresence or absence of Tetrapleura tetraptera. À significant negative correlation with snail
     numbers was found for presence of T. tetraptera“from transmission sites and fruiting of the
     trees when these variables were tested individually. The effect of the presence of T.
     tetraptera on the recovery of snails was significant. There was no significant difference
     between individual variables such as pl, Cat+t concentrations and temperatures of snail
     habitats but these variables produced significant positive correlation with the number of
     snails recovered. Thus, the presence of T.</p>
    <p>tetraptera would then appear to be the most important limiting factor for the presence of
     shails. Aqueous extracts of T. tetraptera was effective as a molluscicide against Bulinus
     globosus and Ilymnaea natalensis. However, pollution of the environment by oils reduced or
     abolished the molluscicidal activity of T. tetraptera.</p>
    <p>The results indicate that T. tetraptera has a potential for the local control of

     USA Bacillus sphaericus, Culex spp. mosquitoes, Culex nigripalpus, Biological control In
     concrete tanks (2.2 x 0.76 x 0.53 m deep) placed outdoors in central Florida, three lots of
     Bacillus sphaericus 2362 liquid (ABG-6262, lot nos. 29-406-CD, 29-293-BA, and 27-242-BA) were
     evaluated for their residual activity against Culex spp. (mostly Cx.</p>
    <p>nigripalpus). Twelve tanks were filled with 8 cm of farm soil covered by 8 cm of sludge
     collected from a local dairy lagoon. Water was added to each tank to achieve a total depth of
     25 cm in each tank and the tanks were left for two weeks for sediment-water nutrient exchange
     and stabilization. The three lots of ABG-6262 were applied (3 repli- cates of each lot) to the
     tanks only once at a rate of 5 liters/ha. Three untreated controls were maintained. Mosquito
     larvae collected. from the lagoon were introduced into the tanks on days O (immediately
     pretreatment), and 7, 14, 21, 28, 34, 42, 47,55, 63, 69, and 105 posttreatment. Four 400-ml dip
     samples were collected from each treated and control tank after one hour (pre-) and after 3-4
     days of larval introductions to establish pre- and posttreatment population density of larvae.
     Lot 29-406-CD (600 ITU/mg) gave 96-1007 control of the larvae for up to 38 days posttreatment.
     Lots 29-293-BA (420 ITU/mg) and 27-242-BA (280 ITU/mg) gave 59-100% and 88-100% larval control,
     respectively. Between 46 and 109 days posttreatment, larval control fluctuated between 0-947
     (29-406-CD), 0-86% (29-293-BA), and 0-92%7 (27-242-BA). In general, the three lots of ABG-6262
     yielded similar residual activity against Culex spp. larvae for up to two months after
     treatment although they varied considerably in potency (ITU B.</p>
    <p>sphaericus/mg). Higher ITU of B. sphaericus in the test formulations did not yield a
     significantly higher and longer-lasting control of Culex spp. larvae.</p>

    <p>USE OF FISH FOR CONTROL OF BLOODSUCKING MOSQUITO LARVAE R.V.Babuyeva.Biological Institute
     Sib.Branch Acad.Sci.,USSR Verkhovka, larvivorous fish.</p>
    <p>In the USSR for control against larvae of bloodsucking mosquitos different fish (belonging to
     41 species) were employed (Abdildaev, 1987). Mosquito fish, Gambusia affinis (Baird et
     Girarad), medaka, Oryzia latipes, stone moroco, Pseudorasbora parva (Schlegel) are perspective
     species for control practice.</p>
    <p>However in severe environment of Siberia larvae-eating fish can not be used for this purpose.
     Prospective biological agent for control of bloodsucking mosquito's larvae is verkhovka,
     Leucaspius delineatus (Heckel). Verkhovka was acclimatized within Zauralje and Western Siberia
     in 1965-1975. Its biomass reaches up to 1-2 centner/ha and their numbers over 1 000 000
     specimen/ha.</p>
    <p>Verkhovka breeds successfully in freshwater and oligohaline (1-5 g/1) reservoirs with
     macrophytes and coarse herbaceous vegetation (phytomass is 100 t/ha). These reservoirs have
     high biogenous composition and release marsh-gas and hydrogen sulphides from bottom sediments,
     pH 6-7,5 (Babuyeva, 1989). Verkhovka feeds on mosquito larvae actively in water temperature
     6-30°C, and can starve up to 60 days.</p>

    <p>Nematode-Bacteria-Proteins-Histopathology-Lepidoptera The insect pathogenic nematode
     Heterorhabditis heliothidis parasitizes a wide range of insects including larvae of the tobacco
     hornworm, Manduca sexta. The life cycle of the nematode and the LDsp of its associated
     bacterium Xenorhabdus luminescens were determined using this host species as a model system.
     Primary and secondary forms of this bacterium were equally as virulent to M. sexta injected as
     newly-ecdysed fourth or fifth instar larvae. As early as 18 hr following infection with
     nematodes, host larvae showed alterations in their growth rate, pigmentation, and behavior.
     Major pathological changes were evident in the digestive tract. Columnar cells in the midgut
     epithelium underwent swelling, degeneration, and were shed into the hemocoel as the gut lost
     its integrity and degenerated completely. The same midgut pathology occurred in nonparasitized
     larvae injected with X. luminescens, indicating it is a bacteria-induced effect. The array of
     antibacterial proteins préviously characterized in M. sexta were not induced in
     nematode-inoculated hornworms, or larvae injected with a ,lethal dose of X. luminescens, thus
     explaïning the potent effects induced in the host. The toxic agent produced by the bacteria is
     now being purified and characterized. Studies were carried out in collaboration with J. Ensign
     and D. Bowen (Department of Bacteriology, University of Wisconsin-Madison). Supported by

    <p>Parasitoid-Hymenoptera-Virus-Protein-Hemolymph Parasitism by the braconid wasp Cotesia
     congregata ïinduces new proteins to be synthesized and released into the hemolymph of host
     larvae of the tobacco hornworm, Manduca sexta. Some hemolymph proteins appear specific to the
     host ('"'host-specific domain"), others are present only in the parasites, and a third set is
     shared by the two partners. The wasp larvae synthesize proteins de novo which are released into
     culture media ïn vitro and presumably the host's “hemolymph in vivo; thus, these parasitoids
     are similar to helminth and protozoan parasites which produce secretory/excretory products that
     circulate in the host. Both ‘early'" and "late" arrays of parasitism-specific proteins appear
     in the host. The most abundant "early" protein is glycolsylated, has a native MW of 190 kd, and
     is comprised of multiple subunits in the 33-35 kd range. Its subunits are now being sequenced
     for comparison to other insect and parasite-derived molecules. This protein is induced by the
     polydnavirus injected by the wasp during oviposition. These virions are enveloped and contain 1
     to 10 nucleocapsids each. A second virus phenotype - a "long" virus with a single nucleocapsid
     - replicates in other ovarian calyx cells and is only rarely seen extracellularly in the calyx
     lumen. Following oviposition, the polydnavirus virions are rapidly taken up by host cells and
     their genes are rapidly expressed after their DNA enters host cell nuclei in the fat body and
     other tissues. This viral "third party agent" likely plays a major role during successful
     parasitism by the wasp.</p>

    <p>Anopheles stephensi - Midgut - Monoclonal antibodies - Digestion Recent successful
     immunizations of cattle against ticks, using tick extracts as antigen, have regenerated much
     interest in vaccination as a potentially viable approach to ectoparasite control. Only very
     limited suppression of fecundity and decreased longevity have been achieved previously when
     immunizing laboratory animals against mosquitoes.</p>
    <p>Using standard techniques plus immunosuppression with cyclophosphamide, two series of
     monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) have been produced which are reactive against midgut tissue of
     mosquitoes. In IFATSs using cross-sections of midguts from both fed and unfed A, stephensi,
     three binding patterns were consistently observed: |) reaction against the midgut contents,
     usually at the periphery of the midgut lumen; il) reaction against the microvilli of the midgut
     epithelium; Hi) reactions at intracellular sites within the epithelial cells Mice producing the
     MAbs from ascites cells were used in feeding experiments to determine the effects of the MAbs
     on longevity of and egg laying by the female mosquitoes. Seven different MAbs were fed three
     times over a period of seven days to two cages each of 70-100 female À, stephensi, and were
     compared to those fed on two groups of control mice - pristane treated with no hybridoma or
     with an anti-CSP hybridoma.</p>
    <p>MAb 27.49.65 caused reduced longevity over the feeding period but had no long term effects.
     At least one MAb (25.68.3) enhanced the survival of mosquitoes without affecting fecundity.
     Fecundity was reduced over a 16 day period by four of the MAbs (25.35.2, 27.41.6, 27.58.2,
     27.61.1). So far, only one MAb (25.35.2) has been identified by immunoblotting, localizing to a
     30 KDa protein throughout a 65 hour feeding cycle.</p>
    <p>These antibodies are currently being assessed further for their effects on the mosquito and

    <p>Using an alcoholic extract of A. maritima dissolved in water a LC. of 450 mg/1 was obtained
     for fries of the guppv (Lebistes reticulatus). This value is 6 to 12 times higher than the
     molluscicidal concentration of 35 tot 70 mg/l used in field experi- ments in Egypt. The LC-, of
     a similar extract of A. maritima for Daphnia magna was 770 mg/1. Doses of 1.008 mg/1 of À.
     maritima had no effect at all on algae (Selenas- trum capricornutum). It can be concluded that
     A. maritima, when used at mollusci- cidal concentrations of 35 to 70 mg/1, is not toxic for
     fishes, neither for zoo- and phytoplancton or small mammals.</p>

     Supella longipalpa, introduite en Europe au cours des dernières décennies, devient une espèce

     pathogènes pour l'Homme, agents qu'elle transporte sur son tégument ou dans son tube digestif,
     les dispersant selon les cas, par sa salive ou ses fèces. De plus, elle induit des allergies,
     dont l'importance et la gravité dépendent de la dispersion des Blattes, de la taille de leurs
     populations et de leurs relations avec l'Homme.</p>
    <p>Les oeufs sont pondus dans des oothèques disséminées dans les recoins et recouvertes de fèces

    <p>Chaque oeuf, enfoncé dans un oeuf de Blatte, est relié à l'extérieur par une plaque

     nymphose débute vers 12 jours. Elle aboutit à la libération d'un adulte, 35 jours après la

    <p>Food competition - Fichhornia crassipes - Simulium damnosum s.1.</p>
    <p>Since the antivectorial campaign in 1948, there has not been a repopulation by S. damnosum
     s.1. of the Kinshasa focus. In the fifties, the Zaire Basin was overgrown with waterhyacinths
     or FEichhornia crassipes.</p>
    <p>We assessed theif effect on the development of S. damnosum in the lab.</p>
    <p>Several rearing tests were simultaneously conducted with and without E. crassipes using a
     simple device with compressed air in glass aquariums.</p>
    <p>The presence of E. crassipes extends the preimaginal development time of blackflies by a
     factor 1.6 and multiplies the daily constant mortality rate by 5. Moreover it induces the
     forming of much smaller imagos. These effects are not due to a toxicity of the waterhyacinth.
     The plant impoverishes rearing water by catching suspended particles in its roots.</p>
    <p>Because of the nutritional competition between E. crassipes and the Simulium larvae, the
     available food is decreased and the development of S. damnosum becomes hampered.</p>

    <p>Spiroplasmas - mosquito vector control For a variety of reasons, our attempts to control
     mosquito vectors (Aedes, Anopheles and Culex) have largely been unsuccessful, while the major
     tropical diseases they transmit (Malaria, Filariasis, Dengue Fever and Yellow Fever) remain an
     imposing challenge to public health authorities. An efficient biological control of mosquito
     vectors or a control based on naturally occurring toxins may provide a means of combatting many
     of these problems in the future. With this optic, ve have been examining mosquito spiroplasmas
     and have identified an organism, Spiroplasma taivanense originally isolated from An. sinensis
     in Taiwan, which has been shown to: 1) significantly reduce the flight capacity of females and
     the survival of adult males and females of Ae. aegypti and An. stephensi following
     intra-thoracic inoculation; 2) significantly reduce larval survival following per os infection
     of larval Ae. ae ti; 3) possess a persistent form in its life-history; 4) lyse Ae.</p>
    <p>albopictus C6/36 cells in vitro; and most importantly, 5) have a reproductive capacity
     typical of procaryotes. Furthermore, S. taivanense is considered an unlikely pathogen of warm
     blooded vertebrates due to its inability to persist at 37°C in vitro and the absence of
     observable pathogenicity following intra-cerebral inoculation of day-old suckling mice. Future
     research vill be directed tovards identifying the molecular basis of this pathogenicity.</p>

    <p>Hunterellus hookeri, parasitoid, Ixodes dammini, Lyme disease, Biological control The
     entomophagus wasp, Hunterellus hookeri (Hymenoptera: Encyrtidae), is known to infest several
     species of ixodid ticks and to result directly in their mortality. Use of this phenomenon to
     possibly lower the population levels of the deer tick, Ixodes dammini, in areas of high tick
     density and a significant incidence of Lyme disease is under study in Rhode Island (USA).</p>
    <p>Described in 1908, this wasp was introduced into Massachusetts (Cape Cod) in 1926 for use
     against the American dog tick, Dermancentor variabilis, without success. In Rho in I.</p>
    <p>was at n = de Island the wasp is now known to be present on Prudence Island, a small iskand
     Narragansett Bay, site of a large deer herd and one of our highest populations of dammini. In
     1988 the proportion of wasp parasitism in questing I. dammini nymphs greatest in May (46%, n =
     46), declined abruptly in June (18%, n = 90) and remained this lower level in ticks collected
     during July (18%, n = 51) and August (11%, 56). Engorged nymphs taken from the white-footed
     mouse, Peromycus leucopus, principal host for immature I. dammini, showed only a 4% incidence.
     There was no evidence of wasp parasitism in engorged larvae collected from P. leucopus. Nymphal
     tie ks parasitized by H. hookeri may be inhibited from acquiring a host.</p>

     hebdomadaire de 60 pondoirs pièges et captures quotidiennes sur appât-humain. Ces donnée sont

     s'attend à un bon contrôle des populations de Culex sp.par G. affinis et des Aedes sp. par M.

     control of snails, the intermediate hosts, is being actively pursued to reduce transmission of
     trematodiasis. Now more emphasis is on biological control since the chemical control is costly
     and harmful.</p>
    <p>Six species of beetles, one waterbug and anymph of dragonfly were screened as predators of
     freshwater snails. Individual species of aquatic insects were placed with one or more members
     of separate or combined species of snails in a water trough filled with dechlorinated water.
     Among beetles, Cybinter tripunctatus asiatus was found to be most voracious consuming Lymnaea
     acuminata, Viviparus bengalensis and Indoplanorbis exustus, respectively, in 15 mins., 24h, and
     24h, followed by Dyticus sp. larvae in 24h and 48h, Laccophilus inefficiens in 24h, 48h,
     Hydaticus incertus in 24h and 28h but not completely consuming the third one, though it died.
     Erectes sticticus was effective against the first two species of snails, consuming in 24h and
     28h, respectively, but not effective against the third species. Dineutes (Spinosodineutus)
     unidentatus and Nepa cinerea were effective only against L.acuminata eating in 48h and 72h,
     respectively. All these insect species, except the nymph of dragonfly, appeared to have been

     Biopesticide - Sporulation - Proteinases Clostridium bifermentans serovar malaysia (C.b.m.) is
     toxic by ingestion to mosquito and blackfly larvae. The larvicidal activity is related to the
     bacterial cells and to the sporulation process. Toxicity against Anopheles stephensi larvae of
     cells grown in a fermentor is very high at t, reaches a maximum around t3-t5 but sharply
     decreases after the sporangium lysis (around t9).</p>
    <p>Such a decrease is, at least partly, due to extracellular metallo- and cysteine-proteinases
     produced mainly during the vegetative growth of the bacteria, and still active after completion
     of sporulation. The alteration of the larvicidal activity after the cell lysis can be partially
     prevented by the addition of proteinase inhibitors such as EDTA or iodoacetic acid. Electron
     microscopic observations revealed the presence of parasporal inclusion bodies and bottle
     brush-like appendages by t4-t5. These protein parasporal inclusions are larvicidal when assayed
     after purification on sucrose density gradients, while the eventual participation of spore
     appendages in the toxicity remains unknown. The study of C.b.m. larvicidal toxins may lead to
     new biopesticides against vectors of human diseases.</p>

     1983 to a group of water-cress cultures which constituted one of the last tran- smission sites
     of intestinal schistosomiasis on the island. In just less than three years after the
     introduction of the competitor, the snail vector Biomphalaria glabrata and also the related
     species B. straminea have totally disappeared from the site.</p>
    <p>Following this success, M. tuberculata was introduced to the other groups of water- cress
     beds which had been discovered at the beginning of the eighties. B. glabrata and B. straminea
     have now totally disappeared from seven groups and in the five remaining groups only rare
     individuals have been collected. Maximum densities of M. tuberculata are reached two years
     after its introduction and this snail is able to maintain high densities several years after.
     The densities may vary between 1,000 to 15,000 individu- als per m2 according to the type of
     soil of the water-cress beds. Biological control is a success in this type of habitat in
     Martinique because of particular ecological conditions which are favourable to the competitor :
     presence of permanent and shallow waters which are well oxygenated, relatively constant
     temperatures all the year and presence of emerged plants regularly distributed.</p>

    <p>Four stations with Lymnaea truncatula, located on siliceous ground (drainage gutters) and
     four habitats on sedimentary ground (road ditches) have been treated by way of a mi- xed
     control associating the use of a molluscicide in April-May (8 1 of CuCl, at 1 mg/1 on a 17-30
     m? surface per station) and the use of zonitid molluscs in July at the begin- ning of the
     summer drying. The final effects of this control have been studied for five years after the
     treatment compared to control habitats (3 and 5 respectively). The trea- ted stations have not
     been recolonized by L. truncatula. Four aquatic snail species have revealed a growth in their
     numbers and an increase in the surface of their habitats at the expense of the former habitats
     for L. truncatula: L. glabra on siliceous ground, L.</p>
    <p>glabra, Physa acuta, P. hypnorum, and Planorbis rotundatus on sedimentary ground. The numbers
     of L. glabra and of P. acuta reached their maximum around the third year and de- creased
     thereafter; those of P. hypnorum and of P. rotundatus increased slightly from the fourth of
     fifth year on after treatment. The colonization of L.-truncatula habitats was incomplete and
     did not reach over 50 7% of the surface for L. glabra and for P. acuta, 20 % for P. hypnorum
     and for P. rotundatus. The bivalve Pisidium casertanum did not show signs of recolonization in
     the treated habitats. Hygrophilous terrestrial molluscs did not reveal any modification in
     their numbers during the five after-treatment years when compared to the control stations. The
     author hypothetizes L. truncatula would be able to prevent the colonization of its habitats
     under normal conditions and admits the existen- ce of a factor, probably emitted by L.
     truncatula, explaining this isolation.</p>

     microscopy (LM) and by electron microscopy (EM) in 90 Lymnaea truncatula infected by Fas- ciola
     hepatica during individual monomiracidial exposures. These molluscs were raised at 20° C and
     killed at day 30 postexposure. In LM, 32 % of the snaiïls had a normally develo- ping tissue
     and 40 % had a fibrous tissue; these tissues had a "spongy"" structure and the amebocytes are
     generally located in the cavities. The tissue of the other 28 7 showed a dense amebocytic
     proliferation. In EM, unproliferative tissues consisted in a juxtaposi- tion of dilated
     lamellae bordered with a basal lamina and filled with intercellular subs- tance. This
     juxtaposition leads to the formation of microcavities which are linked to the central lumen;
     moreover, luminal recesses passed into the lamellae. This aspect does not explain the
     "spongy'"' structure observed in LM. The amebocytes bathed in the intercellular substance and
     easily stuck to the basal iaminae; some are inserted in the microcavities or in the luminal
     recesses. Fibroblast-like cells are always surrounded by basal laminae; their structure was
     near to those of the amebocytes located in the luminal recesses. Col- lagenic-type fibers were
     rare in the tissue. Periluminal squamous cells, covering the la- mellae of the tissue, had a
     morphology not unlike that of the stretched amebocytes or of the fibroblasts; no junction has
     been observed between them. The authors assume that the amebocytes located in the luminal
     recesses, the fibroblasts, and the periluminal squamous cells could all correspond to a one and
     only cellular type.</p>

     l'île de Mayotte. Le pourcentage des gîtes larvaires positifs pour A.gambiae a diminué de 40,6%
     à 5,6% pendant une année. Les captures au pyrèthre ont montré une réduction de la densité par
     chambre de 5,5 à 0,3 femelles de A.gambiae. Le nombre de piqûres par homme, mesuré au moyen de
     captures nocturnes, est passé de 6,3 à 1,2. La réduction des indices entomologiques a fait
     chuter de 50% l'indice plasmodique dans l'échantillon de la population de 0 à 4 ans. Les
     méthodes de contrôle biologique testées, bien acceptées par la population, pourraient être

     50250, Israel Entomoparasitic nematodes, Nematodes, Ticks, Biological control Ticks are
     estimated to cause worldwide losses of as much as US$ 7000 million per annum.</p>
    <p>Ticks of domestic animals are controlled mainly by dipping or spraying of chemical acaricides
     at up to weekly intervals. Widespread efforts have not been directed as yet towards developing
     methods for the biological control of ticks. Ticks are found in the course of their cycle
     mostly în the upper layer of the ground. The entomoparasitic nematodes' infective stage live in
     nature also in the upper layer of the ground. It is attracted by and penetrates the insects
     where its symbiotic bacteria kKi11 their host by septisemia. Nematodes of the Steinernematidae
     and Heterorhabditidae families are known to attack different insect species but they were not
     shown to attack and ki11 ticks.</p>
    <p>In our preliminary work nematodes of different species were found to differ considerably in
     their anti-tick activity. An inoculation of 1000 nematodes killed al] fully engorged ticks in a
     5 cm diameter petri dish. Ticks surviving a lower concentration of nematodes displayed a marked
     reduction in egg production.</p>
    <p>Entomoparasitic nematodes can be promising agents for the biological control of ticks.</p>
    <p>They can be readily cultivated industrially. The nematode's infective stage can survive
     without finding a host for long periods in nature. Due to its motility it is capable of
     .reaching immobile ticks hiding in the upper layer of the ground. It is simple and inexpensive
     to apply nematodes by spraying or as an additive to irrigation water in potentially tick
     contaminated areas.</p>

    <p>THE LATEX OF EUPHORBIA SPLENDENS AS A MOLLUSCICIDE: INVEST IGATION OF SEASONAL, TEMPORAL AND

     splendens - Plant molluscicides - Biomphalaria spp - schistosomiasis Laboratory studies of
     aqueous solutions of the latex of E. splendens var hisloppi according to the WHO standard
     methodology as advised for molluscicide test, demonstrated a strongçactivity against
     Biomphalaria spp. Further studies showed the stability of the molluscicide action along the
     four seasons for Biomphalaria tena gphila, and the LC90 found were: 1,14 ppm (spring); 1,02 ppm
     (autum); 1,09 ppm winter and 1,07 ppm (summer).</p>
    <p>It was also demonstrated the stability of the mollu:scicide property of the latex ‘in natura'
     stocked at room temperature and the product lyophylyzed stocked at 100C, until 90 days (3
     months). The solutions of the latex from two other states of Brazil (endemic areas of
     schistosomiasis), were active against the snails in similar concentrations, as: 0,7 ppm (Minas
     Gerais) and 1,3 ppm (Pernambuco). An aqueous solution at a conçentration of 5,0 ppm was 100%
     lethal for the snails until 13 days, losing gradually the molluscicide property until it is
     almost inactive in the 30th day, under laboratory conditions. Other results demonstrated that
     the lethal dose for mice (5g/kg) was much higher than the lethal dose for snails and no acute
     toxicity and mutagenic activity was found through the studies as: Ames test, microtox,
     chromotest and citotoxicity using CHO (Chinese Hamster Ovary Cells). These date indicate that
     the latex has several characteristics desirable to a molluscicide since it is easily extracted
     from a hardy and widely distributed plant in Brazil.</p>

    <p>THE AMEBOCYTIC REACTION AND THE PRODUCING TISSUE IN FOUR LYMNAEID SPECIES.</p>

    <p>Amebocyte. Amebocyte-producing tissue. Fasciola hepatica. Lymnaea sp.</p>
    <p>The intensity of the circulating amebocytic reaction and the structural aspects of the
     producing tissue have been studied by light microscopy in four species of Lymnaea (L.</p>
    <p>glabra, L. palustris, L. peregra ovata, L. truncatula) and in four life stages per spe- cies
     (newborns, 1, 2, and 4 to 6 mm high molluscs) during a fasciolid infection on day 45 at 20° C.
     Circulating amebocytes were few in number, or absent in newborns; their number was low, or
     medium in most young and adult snails, and high in others. The pro- ducing tissue had an
     inter-reno-pericardial location, sometimes with micro-settlements in the neighbouring
     connective tissue (L. glabra, L. palustris). It could show a normal development, a fibrosis, or
     a more or less stressed proliferation of stem cells, some- times associated to the fibrosis;
     living rediae could dwell in its place. The fibrosis and the proliferation were frequent enough
     in the various experimental groups (from 8 to 66 % for each aspect), whether the infection was
     evolutive or abortive; both aspects did not seem to depend on the snail size measured at
     miracidial exposure. The parasites in the producing tissue are only observed in newborns and in
     the L and 2 mm high snails with a low frequency (less than 13 Z%). The number of circulating
     amebocytes and the aspect of the producing tissue are closely related. The authors infer a) the
     similarity of the structural aspects of the producing tissue, whatever the lymnaeiïd species
     and the life stage, and b) the progressive development of this tissue“s functions, related to
     the size of snails when infected by Fasciola hepatica.</p>

    <p>HOST-PARASITE RELATIONSHIPS : THE "DYSDERCUS-ACAULONA" MODEL

    <p>Dysdercus,Tachinidae,host-parasite relationships,biological control The life cycle of
     Acaulona brasiliana (Diptera:Tachinidae), a parasitoid of the "cotton stainer" Dysdercus
     albofasciatus (Heteroptera:Pyrrhocori- dae),was partially clarified in laboratory conditions.
     ParasitoidS fema- les pierce the abdominal cuticula of the D. albofasciatus nymphalIlI with the
     ovipositor and introduce one egg. The larva grows up in the abdominal cavity of the.-host and
     leaves just before the latest starts its last molting. The released host dies and the larva
     searches actively on the soil for a hiding-place to pupate. The imago of A. brasiliana hatch
     after 15 days (+25°C) and develop well when fed on 10% sucrose solution.Parasi- toid females
     and males are able to copulate 48 hours after hatching and the former starts soon with
     oviposition. In field conditions, this cycle reiterates four or five times during the summer,
     superimposed on the host$s generations. On the other hand, the overwintering of A. brasiliana
     takes place inside the host and not in a soil-slit; at the beginning of the next summer-season,
     the larva releases from just molted imagines and not from late NV as in the ‘summer cycle".</p>
    <p>To search for a possible hormonal factor that would regulate the striking synchronization
     between parasite and host through a "summer" and a winter cycle", juvenoid MPCD (specific for
     Pyrrhoc.) were-assayed. The larva inside a MPCD-treated host does not leave the NV before a
     super- numerary molt.</p>

    <p>EFFECT OF ASCOGREGARINA CULICIS PARASITISM ON AEDES AEGYPTI I.Sulaiman. School of Biological
     Sciences Universiti Sains Malaysia, 11800 USM, Pulau Pinang, Malaysia Ascogregarina culicis -
     Aedes aegypti The purpose of this study is to provide more information on the host- parasite
     relationship between the host - Aedes aegypti and the parasite - Ascogregarina culicis and the
     pontential of the parasite as a biological control agent for Ae. aegypti which is a known
     vector of diseases.</p>
    <p>Four strains of the parasite and 3 stocks of the mosquito were used.</p>
    <p>One day old mosquito larvae in groups of 100 were infected with known concentrations of
     Ascogregarina oocysts. Larval mortality was noted and LD509 and LD9 determined. In a separate
     experiment, the median pupation times o larvae infected with different concentrations of
     oocysts were compared.</p>
    <p>The results show differences in virulence among the strains of As.</p>
    <p>culicis tested. The effect of the parasite is seen from the increased mortality of the
     mosquito larvae and the shortening of the pupation time. The results also show differences in
     the susceptibility among different stocks of Ae. aegypti to infection with Ascogregarina.</p>
    <p>Ascogregarina has a good potential as a control agent for. Ae. aegypti.</p>
    <p>There exist strains of As. culicis with differing virulence as well as stocks of Ae. aegypti
     with differing susceptibility. This suggests a genetic basis in the host-parasite
     relationship.</p>
