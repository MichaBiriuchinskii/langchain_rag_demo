                    these volumes These books,which are supplements of the Bulletin of the french
                    Society of Parasitology, contain the abs- tracts which were accepted after
                    review by the section presidents and sub-section chairmen.</p>
                <p>The abstracts are published under the headings of the sections and sub-sections
                    in whichthey were admitted.</p>
                <p>Each abstract has on the left a three part code, which will be used for reference
                    throughout the Congress: section number-sub-section letter-abstract number.</p>
                <p>For example, S10.C.8 signifies : abstract number 8 - in sub-section C of section
                    10.</p>
                <p>On the right of each abstract is the letter P (= poster ) All accepted
                    communications have to be presented as a poster. For those which are also
                    accepted by the Scientific Comitee for oral presentation, +O is added.</p>
                <p>Among the names of authors is underlined the one of the oral presenter (if work
                    accepted for oral communi- cation...) Ces deux suppléments au Bulletin de la
                    Société fran- çaise de Parasitologie contiennent les résumés qui ont été
                    acceptés apres examen par les présidents de section et les responsables de
                    sous-section.</p>
                <p>Ces résumés sont publiés dans l'ordre des sections et sous-sections dans lesquels
                    ils ont été acceptés.</p>
                <p>Chaque résumé a , à sa gauche, un indicatif de code en trois parties, qui sera
                    utilisé tout au long du Congrès: numéro de section - lettre de sous-section -
                    numero de résumé. Ainsi, S10.C.8. signifie: résumé numéro 8 dans la sous-section
                    C de la section 10.</p>
                <p>A droite de chaque résumé figure la lettre P (=poster ).</p>
                <p>Toutes les communications acceptées doivent en effet être présentées sous cette
                    forme. Pour celles qui ont été retenues par le Comité Scientifique pour
                    présentation orale, est ajouté +0.</p>
                <p>Parmi les noms des auteurs est souligné celui du cosignataire devant assurer la
                    présentation orale, si celle-ci a été acceptée.</p>
                <p>Note de l'éditeur Editor's note For lack of both money and time (we had too
                    little time to print the texts after we received them and moreover many arrived
                    after the deadline ) , it was not possible to have the abstracts ( more than
                    2.300!) typed again.</p>
                <p>They were therefore printed by offset as they were.</p>
                <p>Unfortunately , some were very poorly typed. In addi- tion, the strict
                    instructions we had given were not always respected, many summaries were too
                    long or continued beyond the margins , some photocopies could hardly be
                    deciphered and others texts were not even typed.</p>
                <p>More than 10% of the summaries had to be modified as a consequence (they were
                    reduced and cross-out were rubbed ). This time lost correcting the proofs, you
                    will notice many defects in the reproduction of the Congres abstracts.</p>
                <p>We deeply regret this , but reject all responsibility.</p>
                <p>Pour des raisons d'argent et de temps, il ne nous a pas été possible de faire
                    retaper à la machine les plus de 2.300 résumés acceptés , dont beaucoup ont
                    d'ailleurs été reçus bien après la date limite fixée. Ces résumés ont donc été
                    reproduits en offset, c'est à dire tels qu'ils nous ont été envoyés.</p>
                <p>Malheureusement , beaucoup étaient de mauvaise dactylographie. De plus, les
                    instructions pourtant très précises données pour la présentation n'ont souvent
                    pas été respectées, beaucoup de résumés étant trop longs et sortant des marges
                    indiquées. Certains nous sont par- venus sous forme de photocopies parfois à
                    peine lisi- bles . Quelques uns n'étaient même pas dactylogra- phiés ! En
                    conséquence, plus de 10% de ces résumés ont dû faire l'objet de modifications,
                    réduction, nouvelle frappe, etc….Outre le temps perdu, tout cela se traduit par
                    de nombreux défauts dans dans leur impression.</p>
                <p>Nous le regrettons vivement , mais en déclinons toute responsabilité.</p>

                <p>P. falciparum; gametocytogenesis; stage specific gene P. falciparum parasites in
                    the bloodstream can develop either into asexual schizonts or into the sexual
                    stages, the gametocytes. Analysis of the way the parasites become committed to
                    either type of development using monoclonal antibodies specific for asexual
                    parasites and for gametocytes indicated that this developmental decision occurs
                    during the maturation of the asexual schizonts. At this stage the parasites
                    respond to the environmental conditions and commit the resulting merozoites to
                    differentiate either into asexual parasites or into sexual forms upon entering
                    red blood cells.</p>
                <p>The earliest detectable event in sexual differentiation is the expression, at 30-
                    40 hrs after entering the red blood cell, of an abundant gametocyte specific
                    protein, identified as Pfg 27/25.</p>
                <p>The gene encoding Pfg 27/25 has been cloned from a gametocyte cDNA expression
                    library probed with monoclonal antibodies against the protein. Northern blot
                    analysis showed that the gene is transcribed only in gametocytes and not in ring
                    forms, trophozoites or schizonts. The activation of the transcription of the Pfg
                    27/25 gene occurs at an early stage of gametocytogenesis. The study of its
                    regulation is likely to extend our knowledge of the molecular mechanisms
                    governing P. falciparum sexual differentiation. , S1.A - Contrôle génétique et

                <p>The expression site for the VSG gene of T.brucei contains 7 genes of unknown
                    function (ESAGs, for Expression Site-Associated Genes). Among these, ESAG 4
                    shows homology to eukaryotic adenylyl/guanylyl cyclase genes, in the region
                    encoding the presomptive catalytic domain. The analysis of T.brucei nuclear DNA
                    in ‘Southern blots" experiments reveals that this gene belongs to a family of
                    related sequences and is conserved in other trypanosomatids, such as T. vivax,
                    T. congolense and T. mega.</p>
                <p>In this family, we have detected at least three other members which show
                    extensive open reading frames (GRESAGs, for Genes Related to ESAGs). These
                    encode non variable transmembrane proteins showing high sequence conservation
                    mainly in the region corresponding to the adenylyl/guanylyl cyclade catalytic
                    domain. These putative surface proteins are potentiel candidates for
                    immunoprophylaxy.</p>

                <p>In order to identify molecules with specialized functions in the life-history of
                    Onchocerca concerned with the period of transition between hosts, we set out to
                    identify genes expressed in infective larvae immediately prior to transmission.
                    To do this, we have used a recently devised method for labelling proteins
                    synthesized by developing stages in the vectors, involving the micro-injection
                    of [35S] methionine into the thorax of infected blackflies. Pulse labellings of
                    Onchocerca lienalis larvae within Simulium ornatum s.l. revealed a major acidic
                    protein of 23kD, which is developmentally expressed almost exclusively by

                <p>While most of the estimated 500 million annual infections with the gut parasite
                    Entamoeba histolytica are asymptomatic, in around 10% the amoeba attacks the
                    intestinal mucosa producing invasive Amoebiasis. Little is known of the genetic
                    determinants of invasivness, and whether thé morphologically indistinguishable
                    invasive and non-invasive forms represent distinct sub-species, or two

                <p>filarial nematode, antigen, developmental regulation A 30 kDa glycoprotein is the
                    immunodominant member of a limited set of polypeptides expressed at or close to
                    the surface of adult Brugia pahangi. The expression of this antigen in the
                    larval stages of B. pahangi has been examined using extrinsic labelling with
                    1251 and metabolic labelling with 39S methionine, followed by
                    immunoprecipitation with a rabbit antiserum raised to the 30 kDa adult
                    antigen.</p>
                <p>lodination of the post-infective third stage larva (p.i. L3) reveals a
                    polypeptide at approximately the same molecular weight as the adult antigen. The
                    identity of the p-i. L3 antigen has been confirmed by two dimensional (2D) gel
                    electrophoresis and by peptide mapping of the immunoprecipitated product. In
                    contrast, iodination of mosquito derived L3 suggests that the 30 kDa antigen is
                    either inaccessible to labelling with 125I or is poorly expressed in the
                    cuticle. Iodination of fourth stage larvae (Ly) reveals a major component at
                    approximately 32 kDa. This polypeptide is the Ly homologue of the adult 30 kDa
                    antigen; it is immunoprecipitated with the anti-serum raised against the adult
                    30 kDa antigen and resolves on 2D gels with a similar pattern to the adult
                    antigen. L3 and Ly have been metabolically labelled with 39S methionine.</p>
                <p>Synthesis of the 30 kDa homologue is first observed at day 6-7 p.i., coincident
                    with the start of the L3-Ly moult. The p.i. L3 and the Ly of B. pahangi contain
                    an homologous antigen to the immunodominant 30 kDa antigen. Analysis of mosquito
                    derived L3 suggests that the expression of the 30 kKDa homologue coincides with
                    the infection of the vertebrate host.</p>

                <p>Leishmania gene family; differential regulation By differential cDNA library
                    screening, we have isolated and characterised a number of genes that show either
                    increased or unique expression in the infective (metacyclic) promastigotes of
                    Leishmania major. Lm CDNA 16 recognises 5 transcripts that are regulated
                    differentially during the parasite life cycle. Of these, 2 are present only in
                    metacyclic and amastigote forms. The RNAs map to a closely-linked family of
                    genes (on chromosome 14) that share sequence homology but are not identical.
                    Hybridisation of steady-state RNA with strand specific probes has confirmed that
                    transcription in this region initiates from both strands, although one strand
                    predominates in a manner suggestive of polycistronic transcription. Differential
                    expression of these genes is therefore probably regulated at a post-
                    transcriptional level. Sequence analysis of the Lm cDNA 16 sequence has not
                    shown strong homology to any known gene sequence but has provided indirect
                    evidence for alternative codon usage in Leishmania.</p>
                <p>The identity of the protein product has been investigated, by raising antibodies
                    to fusion proteins translated from constructs in which Lm CDNA 16 sequences are
                    fused downstream of the glutathione-S- transferase gene of Schistosoma
                    japonicum. These antibodies recognise a 50 KD promastigote protein.</p>

                    and parasite integration conception is proposed on the base of systemic approach
                    and law of gene induction.The first stage is opistorchis metacercaria ectivation
                    by signal host products.This non - specific activation of parasite genome(stress
                    genome) is characterized by a wide spectrum of opistorchis gene products with
                    their selection ïin to two groups: 1Î1.necessery for prolonged functioning and
                    2.excessive products.The latter ones are eliminated with the help of regulatory
                    pearasite-host apparetus.The following stage is host receptor system inc lusion
                    complementary to parasite signal(host stress genome).As e result of gene product
                    exchange synchronizeation takes place and dynemic equi- librium of genetic(and
                    metabolic) host end parasite programs establish- es.The host organism changes at
                    all the levels of its structure The re - construction mechanism is the
                    following:genome reprogramming(expressive gene profile changing).Genetic
                    host-perasite program interaction isn't perfect.Genotoxic effect increase leads
                    to permanent host DNA molecule damage(parasite DNA damageis possible).Pathologic
                    process develops.A new quality important mechanism is genotoxic product

                    accomplished under chemically defined conditions. This differentiation process
                    involves differential gene expression and is stimulated by cyclic AMP. Important
                    changes are observed on the fatty acids and surface carbohydrate composition of
                    the parasites during the differentiation process. The metacyclogenesis process
                    also involves cell-adhesion to a substrate. During this adhesion process
                    parasites express developmentally regulated genes, including those encoding
                    cysteine proteases. The differentiation process is blocked by inhibitors of

                    are located at telomeres of the largest chromosomes. We have investigated the
                    gene activation mechanism in metacyclic trypanosome clones and studied the
                    structure of nearly 20 kilobases from each of two such telomeres. The genes are
                    activated in situ, rather than by being copied to a special expression site on
                    another chromosome.</p>
                <p>The two telomeres are very different from VSG expression sites used in

                <p>We believe this results from the metacyclic stage using a gene activation

                    activation mechanism from bloodstream VSG (B-VSG) genes. They occupy telomeres
                    of the largest chromosomes and are activated in situ. We have cloned two of
                    these loci: they have a much simpler structure than telomeres used for
                    expression of B-VSG genes and lack expression site associated genes (ESAGs). We
                    have examined transcription using nuclear “run-on" and Northern blot analyses.
                    The transcription units are very short and contain only the VSG genes. ESAGs are

                    survive in its mammalian host it must first differentiate in the insect vector
                    to a metacyclic trypomastigote form, a process previously shown to be influenced
                    by cyclic AM, By using à substractive hybridization strategy, we have identified
                    a gene (TC26) which is expressed in metacyclic and tissue culture derived
                    trypomastigotes but not log stage epimastigotes and is induced during the
                    differentiation of metacyclic stages in vitro. In contrast, the TC26 transcript
                    was absent in stationary phase epimastigotes of a strain which fails to undergo
                    metacyclogenesis under the same culture conditions. Transcription of TC26 can be
                    induced in epimastigotes by incubation with cyclic AMP and cyclic AMP analogues
                    but is inhibited by activators of cAMP dependent phosphodiesterases. While
                    present in the genome in multiple copies, the TC26 gene is expressed as a single
                    mRNA species of approximately 5kb. Computer analysis of the sequence of a 650bp
                    cDNA clone revealed no significant homologies at eîther the nucleotide or amino
                    acid levels with other known proteins. Using oligonucleotides derived from the

                    study these mechanisms in Eimeria tenella. We targeted genes expressed
                    differentially between the oocyst and second generation merozoite stages. An E.

                <p>Taken together with restriction mapping data, these results indicate that the
                    cDNA clones correspond to unique loci. Northern blot analysis indicate that each

                    kb. E. tenella chromosomes separated by field inversion gel electrophoresis were
                    probed with nick- translated clones to identify their chromosome of origin. Each

                    polypeptides which ranged in size from approximately 13%kDa to 4ZkDa. Southern
                    blotting analysis has indicated that at least 2 tandemly linked copies of the
                    gene are present per genome, and that restriction fragment length polymorphisms
                    occeur both between and within stocks. Sequence analysis of the gene has
                    revealed repeats of either 73bp or 76bp flanked by a 14bp direct repeat. An open
                    reading frame extends through and beyond the repeat sequences. Analysis of RNA
                    levels during a time course of macrischizont differentiation has shown that the
                    gene is partially regulated at the RNA level.</p>

                    - metacyclogenesis - second messengers In previous work, we have developed a
                    metzcyclic (MTC) differentiation system involving epimastigote (EPI) stimulation
                    with T.infestans intestinal macerate. Here the relation between morphogenesis
                    and 2nd messenger participation (Ca?+, diacylglycerol, inositol triphosphate)
                    was studied. Ca?2+ depletion in EPI after sequential passages in LIT medium+EGTA
                    14mM, induced a gradual decrease in growth up to its arrest in the Sth passage;
                    growth was totally recovered by a single passage without EGTA. EPI from each
                    passage in LIT+EGTA were stimulated to differentiate, morphogenesis dropping
                    62-65% from the 2nd passage. To determine the effect of diacylglycerol and
                    inositol triphosphate respectively, phorbol 12 myristate 13 acetate 3nM änd
                    ionophore À 23187 O.2uM, were employed. Morphogenesis. induced in stimulated EPI
                    was as follows: a)when ionophore A 23187 or phorbol were individually used, data
                    dispersion was important and no signifi- cant differences were observed compared
                    with the values for unsupplemented controls; bjwhen both phorbol+ionophore were
                    simultaneously added, morphogenesis of stimulated EPI (11.9%+8.8) were
                    significantly different with respect to their unsupplemented controls
                    (75.0%+16.5). Spontaneous differentiation for unstimulated EPI was invariably
                    below 7%. Besides, the addition of calmodulin inhibitors (chlorpromazine,
                    dibucaine, trifluorperazine, O0.01mM each) reduced differentiation by 95%; this
                    activity might also be related to proteinkinase C inactivation. Results suggest
                    the participation of 2nd messengers in Trypanosoma cruzi morphogenesis.</p>

                    phosphoproteins, protein kinase, cde2 Protein phosphorylation, one of the major
                    processes for regulating cellular functions, plays an essential role in the
                    control of biochemical pathways and is particularly important for proliferation
                    and differentiation processes. Since the significance of such events for the
                    growth and maturation of the human malaria parasite, Plasmodium falciparum, is
                    still unknown, we started with the investigation of phosphoproteins and protein
                    kinases of P. falciparum.</p>
                <p>In a biochemical approach we characterized the P. falciparum specific
                    phosphoproteins by 32P-orthophosphate labeling of parasite cultures and
                    32P-y-ATP labeling of lysates.</p>
                <p>Both methods were used to look for the stage specific distribution and cellular
                    local- ization of the P. falciparum specific or induced phosphoproteins in the
                    erythrocytic cycle. With the 32P-orthophosphate labeling experiments we found
                    about 18, with the 32P-y-ATP labeling experiments about 46, P.falciparum
                    specific phosphoproteins. Some of the proteins show either a stage or a fraction
                    specific distribution or both. More detailed studies are in progress.</p>
                <p>In a molecular genetic approach, based on the amino acid sequence homologies
                    between known protein kinases as defined by Hanks and coworkers we looked for
                    protein kinase coding genes with oligonucleotide mixtures directed against
                    conserved domains. We were able to ïisolate a clone from a genomic library of
                    the K1 strain of P. falciparum.</p>
                <p>Sequence analysis revealed that this clone contains only a part of the potential
                    protein kinase coding gene, which seems to contain at least three introns.
                    Analysis and comparison of the deduced amino acid sequence shows the typical
                    domain structure of protein kinases and revealed the highest degree of homology
                    to the cdc2 kinases. We are now planning to clone the missing part and the cDNA
                    version of this gene.</p>

                <p>As part of a study on growth regulation in trypanosomes we were interested in
                    determining whether a protein with characteristics similar to mammalian protein
                    kinase C exists in T.brucei. Bloodstream and procyclic stages were lysed ïin the
                    presence of chelating agents and high speed supernatants prepared from the two
                    stages were subsequently loaded on to DEAE-cellulose columns and protein was
                    eluted by a NaCl gradient. Different fractions were assayed for the ability to
                    phosphorylate histone, phosvitin and protamine in either the presence or absence
                    of phospholipid, diacylglycerol and calcium. Five protein kinases were eluted
                    from the bloodstream extract applied to the column and at least one of these
                    shared many characteristics with mamnalian protein kinase C. In contrast only
                    three kinases were eluted from the procyclic column and these did not have
                    protein kinase C-like properties. Differential expression of kinases between
                    procyclic and bloodstream stages vas confirmed by an in situ assay after
                    separating proteins by isoelectricfocussing. Nine protein kinases or protein
                    kinase isoenzymes were separated from bloodstream and three from procyclic
                    T.brucei. À commercially available monoclonal raised against mammalian protein
                    kinase C detects a polypeptide in bloodstream lysate but not in procyclic
                    lysate. It seems therefore that a number of kinases are differentially expressed
                    between bloodstream and procyclic T.brucei and at least one of these
                    kinases,shares many properties with mammalian protein kinase C, on the basis of
                    substrate specificity, dependence on phospholipid and diacylglycerol and
                    stimulation by Ca2+.</p>

                <p>P.falciparum, serine rich protein, homology, genomic structure, proteinase We
                    have isolated a DNA fragment coding for a protein sequence highly homologous to
                    a region of the 113 kDa serine rich protein SERP which confers protective
                    immunity to monkeys (1, 2). Using this DNA probe we have screened different
                    genomic and cDNA libraries in order to isolate larger gene fragments.
                    Additionally the polymerase chain reaction was used for extension into the 5’
                    and 3’ regions of the gene. The gene consists of four exons interrupted by three
                    short introns located at positions corresponding to those of the SERP gene. Both
                    genes were shown to be localized on the same P.falciparum chromosome by pulse
                    field gel electrophoresis suggesting that both originate from a common ancestral
                    gene. Both genes are expressed in the blood stage as 3.8kb mRNAs in high yield.
                    The deduced amino acid sequence is highly homo- logous to SERP, but it does not
                    contain a serine stretch. A highly hydrophilic region specific for the protein
                    was expressed in E.coli for preparation of antisera. These recognize a schizont
                    polypeptide of 140 kDa within the parasitophorous vacuole as estimated by
                    Western blot analysis and immunoelectronmicroscopy. Like SERP the 140 kDa
                    protein also exhibits a region highly homologous to cysteine proteinases (3)
                    suggesting that both proteins may function as proteinases at the time of
                    merozoite release from the infected erythrocyte.</p>

                <p>Previous studies have demonstrated that differentiation of the macroschizont of
                    T.annulata to the merozoite in vitro (over a period of up to ié6 days) results
                    in alterations in monoclonal antibody reactivity and the expression of a SÿkDa
                    polypeptide in merozoites. Here we investigated the point at which novel
                    polypeptide expression occurs in a time course of parasite differentiation. The
                    antigen recognised by monoclonal SEi has been located to the merozoite surface.
                    By immunof luorescence assay we have found that the antibody does not react with
                    early differentiating forms, but clearly reacts with differentiating
                    macroschizonts and free merozoites in the later stages of the time course
                    (around day 9 to 14). From this result and the fluorescent staining pattern we
                    conclude that the detected polypeptide is first expressed on the membrane of
                    differentiating macroschizont, and beromes located on the surface of the
                    merozoite through a process of membrane budding. Using immune bovine sera and
                    monoclonal antibodies we have identified, by western blotting, novel
                    polypeptides in extracts of differentiating cultures. The most notable of these
                    polÿypeptides are of 3%%kDa and 129kDa, and are first detected around day 8.</p>

                    domains in T. brucei and in two corresponding but small domains in L. tarentolae
                    and Crithidia fasciculata. Editing of one of the domains was developmentally
                    regulated in T. brucei. Numerous partially edited RNAs were characterized as
                    cDNAs.</p>
                <p>The partially edited regions ranged in size from 1 to over 107 nts, overlapped
                    others and most had a 3’ boundary identical to that of at least one other
                    partially edited regions. The characteristics of these regions suggest that
                    editing occurs generally but not precisely in the 3’ to 5’ direction and acts on
                    blocks of RNA sequence.</p>

                    congolense; chancre; M-VAT In order to understand the role which chancre forms
                    of trypanosomes play in the induction of host immunity, it is necessary to
                    obtain more information on the antigenic expression of the parasites at this
                    early stage of infection. In this study, the expression of metacyclic variable
                    antigen types (M-VATSs) among dividing populations of T. congolense growing both
                    in vivo in rabbit chancres and in vitro on bovine aorta endothelial cell
                    monolayers was studied. Selective neutralisation experiments were performed in
                    which a single M-VAT was deleted from a cultured metacyclic population by
                    incubation with a specific monoclonal antibody and guinea pig complement.</p>
                <p>Subsequent expression of the deleted M-VAT and of two other unrelated M-VATSs was
                    determined by an indirect: immunofluorescent antibody test. The deleted M-VAT
                    was re-expressed both in vivo and in vitro and the propor- tions of unrelated
                    M-VATS were not markedly affected by the neutralisation of this single M-VAT.
                    This demon- strates that antigenic switching is occurring and suggests that each
                    trypanosome in these populations has the ability to express any M-VAT within its
                    repertoire. In addition, an overall similarity was observed between M-VAT
                    expression and re-expression in the in vivo and in vitro systems, suggesting
                    that the in vitro system may provide a useful model for investigating the
                    trypanosomes occurring in the tsetse infected mammalian host at an early stage
                    of infection.</p>

                <p>African trypanosome, differentiation, developmental regalation, transcript levels
                    Of the few developmentally regulated nuclear genes from trypanosomes, none have
                    had the molecular mechanisms underlying their differential expression
                    elucidated. Such genes are potentially powerful tools with which to dissect
                    regulatory networks controlling gene expression during differentiation. We have
                    isolated a CDNA clone corresponding to a gene that is positively regulated
                    during in vitro differentiation of Trypanosoma rhodesiense bloodstream
                    trypomastigotes to procyclic forms. Insert from this clone detects a minor
                    transcript of 1.4kb and a predominant polyadenylated transcript of 1.6 kb that
                    is 15 times more abundant in procyclic forms than in bloodstream forms. The
                    kinetics with which these transcripts accumulate in steady- state RNA during
                    differentiation have been investigated by probing Northerns of total RNA
                    isolated from differentiating bloodstream forms at different time points after
                    introduction into culture at 27°C. Transcript levels begin to increase within
                    thirty minutes of the shift to culture and peak 48 hours before the culture
                    exhibits a procyclic morphology. Southern analysis of genomic digests reveals
                    that both transcripts arise from a single genetic locus probably residing on
                    nuclear rather than maxicircle DNA since the transcripts are detected in
                    dyskinetoplastic mutants. Positive regulation of this gene was found to occur
                    both in the absence of protein synthesis and in a nontransforming strain blocked
                    very early in the developmental program, both conditions under which
                    accumulation of procyclin transcripts did not occur in control experiments.
                    Thus, these two positively developmentally regulated genes appear to be under
                    the control of distinct classes of regulatory factors. The class controlling
                    expression of genes like the procyclins must be synthesized de novo upon the
                    environmental shift, while expression of genes such as this novel one is
                    mediated by a class of activatable factors present in latent form in bloodstream
                    trypomastigotes. DNA sequence analysis reveals an open reading frame sufficient
                    to encode a protein of about 37 kDa within the cONA insert, but data base
                    searches for homology at the amino acid or nucleotide level have yielded nothing
                    to suggest what the nature of the gene product might be. Supported by NIH grant

                    to procyclin, two abundant glycoproteins at the surface of bloodstream and
                    procyclic forms,respectively, was studied in a pleamorphic population of
                    Trypanosoma brucei. After triggering differentiation, the bloodstream forms
                    transformed synchronously and arising procyclic cells divided after a lag phase
                    of 12h. Within 12h the cells acquired a full complement of procyclin. After a
                    lag of 4h, the cells lost mfVSG with a half time of about 8h.</p>

                    and clinical aspects of Trichinellosis.</p>
                <p>At present, the most common techniques used to confirm this variability are
                    isoenzyme electrophoresis and restriction endonuclease analysis of DNA.</p>
                <p>In the present study fifteen Spanish isolates of Trichinella, from domestic and
                    wild origin, were compared by genomic DNA cross-hybridization and by
                    electrophoresis following restriction endonuclease digestion (Eco RI and Hind
                    III). Digested DNAs were also analy- zed by hybridization using a P-32 labelled
                    DNA probe specific for cysted Trichinella iso- lates.</p>
                <p>Two restriction endonuélease and cross-hybridization patterns were observed. One
                    was exhibited by two: wild isolates while a second was shared by the other wild
                    and the si- nanthropic ones. These two patterns respectively correspond to TB

                <p>As diagnostic application of these studies, crude larval and adult antigens
                    prepared from representative isolates of each of the two genetic patterns were

                    responsible for the infection. Furthermore, no serological

                    well as a size variation of homologous chromosomes. We attemp- ted to identify
                    the molecular events responsible for the polymorphism of the three smallest
                    chromosomes of various strains. These chromosomes vere isolated by pulse field
                    gel electrophoresis and identified with specific probes or by using restriction
                    mapping studies. We found an im- portant variation affecting up to 20% of the
                    chromosome size. In five cases out of six, the size variation of the chromosome
                    I was confined to the same fragment containing the telomeric extremity.
                    Furthermore, various homologous chromosomes of different size were found within

                <p>In this case, each of the three smallest chromosomes were present in two copies
                    of different sizes. In this way the identification of homologous chromosomes by

                <p>Screening of a genomic DNA library from the cestode Echinococcus multilo- cularis
                    provided a 1.3 kilobase fragment which strongly hybridizated with Echinococcus
                    species DNA but did not with Taenia saginata DNA. Using this latter as probe, it
                    was found that: (i) this insert cross-hybridized with all 20 E.multilocularis
                    isolates and 2 E.qgqranulosus isolates tested (ii) after HaelIlI digestion,
                    differences appeared in the hybridization pattern between both species (a 1,2 kb
                    band for E.qgranulosus and a 1,1 kb band for E.multilocularis) (iii) a
                    ladder-effect with multiples of 1.3 kb was evident in both species after partial
                    Sau3A and Taql digestions (iv) the genomic copy number was roughly estimated at
                    50.</p>
                <p>DNA sequence analysis of the whole insert did not show any evidence of similarity
                    with known sequences. À possible open reading frame of 714 nucleotides was
                    found. Northern-blot hybridization indicated that this 1.3 kb element is
                    transcribed in E.multilocularis.</p>
                <p>Thus E.granulosus and E.multilocularis share a homologous tandemly arrayed,
                    moderately repetitive DNA family. This fragment may serve as a basis for the

                    tissue specific expression The aim of our work is to characterise the
                    organisation and structure of the genome of the major parasitic nematodes of
                    sheep, Trichostrongylus colubriformis, Haemonchus contortus and Ostertagia
                    circumcincta, with a view to developing improved methods of diagnosis and to
                    facilitate rational drug or vaccine design. The first step in achieving this aim
                    was to isolate, clone and characterise repetitive sequences in the parasite
                    genome and to develop diagnostic probes. Repetitive sequences have been isolated
                    from the DNA of each species by shotqun cloning genomic DNA into pUC-18 followed
                    by colony hybridisation using labelled genomic DNA as a probe. Repeat sequences
                    specific for each species have been analysed by Southern blot, dot blot and DNA
                    sequence analysis. Plasmid pTcl5 contains a 1.2 kb insert that hybridises
                    specifically to the DNA of T.</p>
                <p>colubriformis. Plasmid pHc44 contains a 150 bp insert specific for H. contortus.
                    The plasmid pOcl contains a 1.1 kb insert specific for O. circumcincta DNA.
                    Further characterisation of the genome was achieved by cloning genes present in
                    single copies in the parasite genome. Differential screening of uterine and
                    intestinal specific cDNA libraries of H. contortus using uterine or intestinal
                    cDNA-probes resulted in the isolation of genes expressed in a tissue specific
                    manner and therefore represent potential targets for drugs or antibodies. These
                    cDNAs are currently being characterised by sequence analysis and homology
                    studies. Our results show that sheep parasitic Trichostrongylids contain
                    significant amounts of repetitive DNA sequences arranged throughout the genome
                    often in tandem arrays. Some of these repeats are specific for each species and
                    are therefore potentially useful for differential diagnosis. Tissue specific
                    single copy genes from H. contortus have been isolated and are being assessed
                    .</p>

                    Plasmodium berghei - subtelomeric repeats - chromosome size polymorphism The
                    presence in immediate subtelomeric position of tandem repetitive ele- ments
                    separated by stretches of telomeric sequence makes the organisation of
                    chromosomal extremities in P.berghei very similar to that of the yeast
                    S.cerevisiae. Recombinational events involving loss or addition of repeti tive
                    units (2.3 kb in length) explain the size contraction or expansion affecting in
                    particular 2.3 kb-rich chromosomes. Pairing between actual telomeres and
                    internal telomeric sequences residing on non-homologous chro mosomes can promote
                    the transfer of 2.3 kb units to chromosomes originally lacking the repeated
                    subtelomeric structure. Experiments supporting the proposed mechanisms are

                    950 Kb. In vitro translation of RNA produces a 57 kd peptide immunoprecipitated
                    by a specific rabbit serum raised to a 66 kd peptide recognised by VL patients.
                    Our studies suggest greater complexity in gp63 gene organisation and expression
                    than previously reported.</p>

                    at physiological conditions, and after DNA purification, denaturation and
                    spreading. Psoralen crosslinking of soluble chromatin at low salt conditions at
                    pH7 or pHi0 resulted in an irregular array of single stranded (ss) bubbles
                    separated by variable stretches of double stranded (ds) DNA. The ratio of the
                    total length of ss bubbles to the contour length of the DNA molecules was low.

                <p>Plasmodium falciparum - Phosphoglycerate kinase gene Malaria parasites are highly
                    dependent upon the glycolytic pathway for energy production, which therefore
                    presents a potentially attractive target for new antimalarial drugs. As part of
                    a programme to characterise the genes encoding the enzymes of this pathway, we
                    have isolated the phosphoglycerate kinase (PGK) gene from the most pathogenic
                    human malaria parasite P. falciparum. Owing to the ineffectiveness of both
                    heterologous and oligonucleotide probes, we took advantage of the extreme
                    sensitivity of the polymerase chain reaction (PCR), employing multiply redundant
                    primers based on the highly biased codon usage of this organism. Sequencing
                    shows that the malarial enzyme bears a moderately close resemblance to other PGK
                    molecules, with ca.</p>
                <p>65% amino acid homology to the human enzyme overall, but with a closely similar
                    pattern of highly conserved residues. The gene is currently being characterised
                    with respect to copy number, chromosomal location and expression in vitro and in
                    vivo. The abundance of structural data available for PGK molecules of other
                    organisms will facilitate characterisation of the malarial protein beyond the
                    primary sequence level, which in turn may eventually allow differences between
                    the parasite and host enzymes to be exploited.</p>

                <p>Trypanosoma brucei,Variant Specific Glycoprotein(VSG) gene promoter The
                    identification of trypanosome promoters has,until now, proved
                    impossible.However,low level UV irradiation of trypanosomes (Pays et
                    al,1989.Mol.Cell.Biol.9,4018-4021), has allowed us to map the start site,and
                    clone cDNAs from the beginning of the VSG transcription unit of AnTat1i.3a,and
                    localise the putative promoter region.lt has been difficult to obtain DNA clones
                    from this region.However,when a 1.6kb fragment from the probable allelic
                    locus(AL) of the expression site,spanning the putative promoter region ,was
                    cloned upsteam of the chloramphenicol acetyl transferase(CAT)gene,with the polyA
                    addition site from ESAG7(for expression site associated gene)downstream,this
                    construct directed the expression of the CAT gene,and low,but detectable,levels
                    of enzyme activity were present after thin layer chromatography of CAT assay
                    products.A control construct, which lacked the AL sequence showed no
                    activity.This result provides further evidence that we have indeed located the
                    trypanosome VSG gene promoter.The fact that the promoter region used is believed
                    to be silent in AnTat1.3a indicates that there are multiple VSG promoters in the
                    T.brucei genome which are capable of directing transcription,but which are
                    repressed by an unknown mechanism.</p>

                <p>We have used several genes from the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans and other
                    organisms to probe southern blots of DNA prepared from the parasitic nematode
                    Ostertagia circumcincta. Even when using highly conserved genes under conditions

                <p>We probed a lambda (EMBL-4) genomic library of O.circumcincta with a collagen
                    gene from C.elegans. Five positive clones have been identified. An analysis of
                    these clones indicates that they are all different from each other and that they
                    do contain homologies to the C.elegans collagen gene used to detect them. The
                    genomic organisation of the cloned sequences is being investigated, and
                    subclones are being constructed for DNA sequence analysis. The characteristic
                    amino acid repeats contained in collagens should be evident if the clones do
                    indeed encode coïlagens.</p>

                    systems.</p>
                <p>The isolates could be divided into two groups on the basis of enzyme banding
                    patterns.</p>
                <p>The majority of Giardia isolates (84%) showed a single-banded pattern for all the
                    enzymes as would be expected for an asexual, haploid organism. A second group of
                    isolates (16%) produced a multiple-banded pattern for one or more of the enzymes
                    examined, which were retained in cloned populations. A number of interpretations
                    may be considered to explain the multiple-banded patterns. The isolates may be
                    haploid, with isoenzymes specified by multiple loci or they may be diploid (or
                    polyploid), with isoenzymes specified by different alleles at the same locus.
                    Distinguishing between the two alternatives is complicated by the existence of
                    two apparently identical nuclei.</p>

                <p>tRNA genes, U SnRNAs, Mitochondrial import, tRNA genes appear to be absent from
                    the mitochondrial genome of trypanosomes suggesting that tRNAs are either
                    cryptically encoded in the Kkinetoplast DNA and subsequently edited or that they
                    are nuclear encoded and imported into the mitochondrion. We have isolated genes
                    coding for tRNA arg (anticodon GCA), and tRNA lys (TTC). The predicted
                    trypanosome tRNA sequences conform in every respect to the consensus sequence
                    and secondary structure requirements for eukaryotic cytoplasmic tRNAs. The two
                    tRNA genes are 90nt apart and are located immediately upstream of the U RNA B
                    gene. Further upstream of the tRNA lys is a 275nt RNA gene that has no apparent
                    homologue in the data bases. The tRNA 1ys and U RNA B genes are transcribed off
                    one strand whilst the tRNA arg and 275nt RNA are transcribed in the opposite
                    orientation. Two further tRNAs, tyr (anticodon ATG) and thr (anticodon TGC),
                    were discovered upstream of the U6 snRNA gene. The distance between the RNAs and
                    the direction of transcription are almost identical for both the RNA B and U6
                    loci. As the tRNA lys gene hybridises to mitochondrial RNA we are analysing the
                    tRNA lys gene family in order to investigate structural features that may be
                    important if tRNAs are imported into the mitochondrion. At least four copies of
                    the gene are detected on Southern blots and these are being cloned and

                    found that most genes are associated with the largest diploid bands,with
                    ocassional representation at the smaller bands. Some genes for specialized
                    functions (species specific) present larger copy numbers at the smaller

                    a radioactive probe is a new stage in marking of genomes. The technology called

                    Plasmodium.vinckei (3 isolates) have been studied using orthogonal field
                    alternation gel electrophoresis (OFAGE). The genome of each species was resolved
                    into 9 to 11 chromosomal DNA molecules of varying intensities which seem to
                    represent 14 chromosomes ranging in size from 600kb to 3500kb. The position of
                    certain chromosomes allowed the identification of an unique karyotype for each
                    of the isolates and lines studied.</p>
                <p>Furthermore, the chromosome pattern is strictly conserved in the different
                    developmental stages and in both hosts, suggesting that important chromosomal
                    rearrangement do not occur during the life cycle of the parasite. Some isolates
                    showed less than 14 chromosomes suggesting that the number of chromosomes could
                    be different among the members of plasmodium genus.</p>

                    screened with serum from a patient with chronic Chagas heart disease (c Ch H D
                    serum). One clone, JLS, from the epimastigote library and two clones, G-13 and
                    S-23, from the trypomastigote library reacted strongly with c Ch H D sera, and
                    were selected for further study. All three clones encode the following 14 aa,
                    C-terminal sequence: EEEEDDDMGFGLED. It is highly homologous to the sequence
                    found at the C- terminus of the human P proteins SD (D/E)DMGFGLFD. The T. cruzi
                    clones hybridize on Northern blots with two mRNA bands of similar size as those
                    coding for the human P proteins (0.7 and 1.3 kb). A probe derived from G-13 only
                    hybridizes with the 0.7 kb MRNA band. Southern analysis of genomic DNA together
                    with the sequences of the cDNAs suggest that there are, at least, four P protein
                    genes in T. cruzi.</p>

                    However, a closely related species, T. saginata, whose larvae is not infective
                    to humans, is also found ïin human intestine. To ascertain if specificity could
                    be obtained when comparing DNA from T. saginata with T. solium, eggs and genomic
                    DNA were obtained and dotted onto nitrocellulose membranes. T. saginata DNA,
                    used as probe, was quite specific since it hybridized only slightly with T.

                <p>Unexpectedly, T. solium DNA used as probe, hybridized with T. saginata eggs or
                    DNA similarly as with homologous eggs and DNA. A reasonable explanation is that
                    T.</p>
                <p>saginata and T. solium share DNA sequences, present in a higher number of copies
                    in the first species. The presence of repetitive sequences was tested by
                    restriction enzyme analysis of DNA samples from both species; one to three
                    repetitive fragments ranging from about 2 to more than 10 Kb were delected in T.
                    saginata DNA digested with 5 out of the 7 enzymes tested. In contrast, in order
                    to observe repetitive fragments in T. solium DNA it was necessary to digest a
                    larger quantity of DNA. These results are consistent with a higher number of
                    repetitive sequences ïin T. saginata. The repetitive fragments were also
                    hybridized with sequences of ribosomal DNA from Trypanosoma cruzi; since no
                    hybridization was found with the repetitive fragments, we discarded the
                    possibility of these repetitive sequences being ribosomal genes. We are now
                    analyzing which of these sequences are common to both species, and which are
                    specific.</p>

                <p>Electrophoretic karyotype analysis of Giardia has shown different DNA patterns
                    for Giardia duodenalis (human, beaver, sheep, dog, and muskrat isolates), G.
                    muris (mouse), and G. ardeae (great blue heron). In an attempt to study Giardia
                    taxonomy at the DNA sequence level, the rDNA genes of these three Giardia were
                    cloned and restriction enzyme maps were constructed. The rDNA repeats of these
                    Giardia show completely different restriction enzyme recognition patterns. The
                    size of the rDNA repeat ranges from approximately 5.7 kbp in G. duodenalis to
                    7.6 kbp in G. muris; the size of the rDNA operon in G. ardeae type is 7.5 kbp.
                    These size differences are mainly attributable to the variation in the length of
                    the spacer. Minor differences exist among these Giardia in the sizes of their
                    small subunit rRNA and the internal transcribed spacer between small and large
                    subunit rRNA. The sequence of the small subunit rRNA of G. muris and G. ardeae
                    was determined and compared to that of G. duodenalis.</p>
                <p>Furthermore, the 5.8S rRNA sequences of all three Giardia were determined. Both
                    the small subunit rRNA and the 5.8S rRNA showed considerable sequence
                    variation.</p>
                <p>The rDNA sequences of G. duodenalis and ardeae type appear more closely related
                    to each other than to G. muris. These findings suggest that the rDNAs may be
                    useful DNA probes for species identification. This research was supported in

                    Theileria parva, a protozoan parasite of economic importance to the livestock
                    industry in eastern, central and southern Africa, exhibits genotypic and
                    phenotypic polymorphism as evidenced by the presence of restriction fragment
                    length polymorphism and lack of cross-protection between different stocks of the
                    parasite. To study the genetic basis of these polymorphisms we are attempting to
                    construct a genomic restriction map of the parasite using the infrequently
                    cutting restriction enzymes, Not I and Sfi I. Not I linking fragments are
                    normally cloned by co-circularisation with a selectable marker, digestion with
                    Not I and ligation into a vector Not I site. Since different Sfi I sites
                    generally have different cohesive ends, this approach requires modification for
                    Sfi I linking clones. We have developed an alternative technique in which the
                    ‘specifically linearised molecules are physically separated using a high
                    concentration of Seaplaque agarose. We were able to achieve a 25-fold enrichment
                    for linking clones, expected at a frequency of 1/60 in the initial library of
                    T.parva made in Bluescript vector from 4-6 Kb Sau3A partial fragments of the
                    genomic DNA. The linking clones prepared in this manner enabled mapping of
                    approximately 80% of the T.parva genome of 10 million bp. This technique is
                    applicable in mapping small genomes for which representative plasmid libraries
                    are comfortably handled.</p>

                    kinetoplast DNA (kKDNA) was purified from ten Phytomonas isolates originating
                    from various countries and recently cultured in vitro. Topoisomerase II resolved
                    the huge kDNA network in free minicircles which were then analyzed by electron
                    microscopy, restriction endonucleases and Southern blot hybridization. The sizes
                    of the Phytomonas minicircles varied from 1.3 to 2.8 kilobase pairs (kb).
                    Restriction endonuclease analysis showed that they were heterogeneous in base
                    sequences and that heterogeneity could be elevated in certain isolates. However
                    most minicircles from two isolates were homogeneously cleaved with a variety of
                    endonucleases, allowing to map the restriction sites. Moreover restriction
                    endonuclease cleavage permitted to separate after electrophoresis maxicircles
                    usually present in low proportion (&lt;5% of the total KDNA).</p>
                <p>Cross hybridization experiments were performed by Southern blot technique using
                    free minicircles from different isolates as probes. Data show that minicircles
                    from most Phytomonas isolates contain homologous DNA sequences ranging from less
                    than 10% to large homology. In conclusion, our data suggest that the restriction
                    cleavage and hybridization techniques could be used to characterize
                    Phytomonas.</p>

                    1.12, 1.13, and 1.14 are progeny of WaTat 1.1 and share some surface exposed
                    epitopes with 1.1. 5 surface-reactive monoclonal antibodies (MoAbs) were
                    prepared against WaTat 1.1. Of these, all but MoAb 22A1 recognize 1.12, all but
                    24Al recognize 1.14 and none of the 5 MoAbs recognize 1.13. There is surface

                    length VSG-cDNAs were prepared and sequenced from each trypanosome.</p>
                <p>The sequences were partially homologous and distinguished from one another by
                    multiple point substitutions throughout. There were the following base changes
                    from the 1.1 progenitor organism: 44 base changes in 1.12, 156 in 1.13 and 143
                    in 1.14. The substitutions were clustered; relatively more were found in the
                    first 800 bases and last 200 bases coding for protein and the fewest in
                    positions 800-1300. These resulted in 25 amino acid substitutions in 1.12 (all
                    in the coding sequence for the mature protein), 58 amino acid substitutions in
                    1.13 (12 in the signal peptide, 5 in the C-terminal extension and 41 in the
                    coding sequence for mature protein) and 59 amino acid substitutions in 1.14 (4
                    in the signal peptide, 4 in the C-terminal extension and 51 in the coding
                    sequence for mature protein). Although the total number of changes was similar
                    in 1.13 and 1.14, more of the substitutions in 1.14 (38/59) than 1.13 (14/58)
                    were clustered close to the C- terminus. This may explain the greater
                    differences observed in 1.13 surface exposed epitopes using MoAbs. Analysis of
                    genomic DNA by Southern blotting revealed that perfectly faithful basic copies
                    do not exist for the 5’ region of 1.12, 1.13 or 1.14 VSG genes in the progenitor

                    fingerprint We have examined over 50 isolates of Giardia duodenalis from human
                    and other animals to determine the extent of intraspecific variation. Such
                    studies are important in understanding the epidemiology of giardiasis and the
                    functional significance of biochemical variation. Protein analysis by
                    polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and immunoblotting suggests few differences
                    exist between isolates. Chromosome analysis using Field Inversion Gel
                    Electrophoresis has indicated two electrophoretic karyotypes, one with 3
                    chromosomes smaller than 800kb and the other with 4 chromosomes of this size.
                    These karyotypes appear to be associated with geographic distribution of the
                    strains. Allozyme analysis of the same isolates showed four discrete genetic
                    groups with fixed genetic differences at 23-69% of loci examined. Isolates
                    established from human and other animal sources share the same characteristics
                    and while not specifically answering the important question of whether
                    giardiasis is a true zoonosis do indicate that until further information is
                    available it would be appropriate to assume that this is so. A DNA

                    and the peptidase detected using the substrate Phenylalanyl-glycyl-glycine). The
                    parental stocks (STIB 386 and STIB 247) are homozygous but variant for
                    isocitrate dehydrogenase and alkaline phosphatase and allow the typing of the 27
                    progeny clones as either hybrid or parental. On this basis 22 clones were shown
                    to be identical to STIB 247 and 5 to be hybrid. The peptidase (Phe-Gly2} is
                    heterozygous in STIB 247 and 3 of the 22 parental STIB 247 clones were show to
                    be homozygous for this marker, implying that these three clones were the meiotic
                    products of self- fertilisation. Pulse field gel electrophoresis of perparations
                    from two of these clones (clones 57 and 58) have been used to define their
                    karyotype relative to the original parental stocks; both clones are different
                    from each other and from the parental stock. Clone 57 lacks a chromosome band in
                    the 2-3Mb region while clone 58 lacks a chromosome band at “1:5Mb. Our current
                    interpretation of these alterations is that they arise from chromosomes
                    segregating at meiosis. At the present time chromosome specific gene probes are
                    being isolated to establish this.</p>
                <p>These results demonstrate, for the first time, that genetic exchange in T.brucei
                    not only involves cross-fertilisation but also self-fertilisation.</p>

                    fragment lenght polymorphisms(RFLPs) have been carried out to investigate
                    eventual differences among several strains of T. gondii. The restriction
                    endonuclease Sal I was used to obtain different fragments from isolateÿ
                    parasitic DNA. These fragments were further analysed by Southern blot using a
                    specific P-labelled repetitive sequence T. gondii probe (pTGRIE). Four different
                    RFLP patterns were observed among the 6 tested strains : the pattern À was
                    linked to the virulent RH Sabin strain : the pattern B was associated with two
                    strains of intermediate pathogenicity (C and M7741) ; the pattern C was found in
                    two chronic strains of human origin (PRUGNIAUD AND HARAN) ; the pattern D
                    corresponded to a chronic strain of ovin origin (C56). Therefore, as observed
                    with other parasites, T. gondii also presented DNA polymorphism associated with
                    strain patho- genicity.</p>

                    result in the appearance of a new parasite population resistant to the

                <p>For all the markers studied, the patterns are identical including the patterns

                    indicates that the variant and the original parasites population can be regarded

                    The molecular analysis of the antigen(s) involved has been undertaken, and is of

                    of P. falciparum can be propogated, either by direct blood transfer in naïve
                    monkeys or by in vitro culture within human red blood cells.</p>
                <p>We have found that parasites derived in vivo or in vitro are genetically
                    different. Restriction mapping and PCR analysis indicate they differ for
                    numerous genetic markers such as P 190, S-antigen, 9%61R, Pf11.1 and rep20
                    genes. Two sub-populations at least coexist within the original isolate of the
                    Palo Alto strain. The first one, PAP, minor n vivo is major in the in vitro
                    culture, whereas the second one, PAC, is major in the Saimiri monkey and rapidly
                    lost in culture.</p>
                <p>When injected in monkeys, the PAP population procured low grade parasitemias. But
                    interestingly, this strain induced a potent immunity in the Saimiri, that
                    enabled the monkey to completely block subsequent challenge with a virulent
                    strain. The PAP strain thus behaves as attenuated parasites, and could represent
                    an attractive model to assess the feasability of an attenuated vaccine.</p>

                    nematodes A potentially useful strategy for probing cDNA or genomic libraries
                    from parasitic nematodes for specific proteins of interest is to use DNA
                    sequences which code for the desired protein in other organisms. However, among
                    metazoans, the majority of cloned genes have been obtained from mammals, and
                    their use in cross-phylum probing of nematode gene libraries is problematic.
                    Similarly, the free-living nematodes (such as C. elegans) are thought to have
                    diverged from parasitic species as much as 5 x 108 years ago. Differences in the
                    frequency with which various codons are used among species (the codon bias) may
                    impede attempts to detect homologous genes with DNA probes. To determine if a
                    common codon bias exists among nematodes, we compared codon frequency among
                    species of the orders Rhabditata (Caenorhabditis elegans), Strongylata
                    (Haemonchus contortus), Ascaridata (Ascaris suum) and Filariata (Brugia malayi,
                    B. pahangi and Onchocerca volvulus}" Comparison by simple correlation among
                    these organisms showed that the three filariae were quite similar (r&gt;0.8),
                    that H. contortus was similar to these three species and to A. suum (r&gt;0.69),
                    and that A. suum was distinct from the filariae (r&lt;0.6).</p>
                <p>There was little similarity between the filariae and C. elegans (r&lt;0.4). These
                    data demonstrate that not all nematodes share a common codon bias and that genes
                    obtained from one may not necessarily be useful as probes for the homologous
                    genes in others.</p>

                    future studies directed at characterizing the molecular interaction between
                    benzimidazole anthelmintics and their target, the microtubules. A B. pahangi
                    genomic clone containing a B-tubulin gene was isolated and the gene was
                    sequenced using the dideoxy chain termination method. The coding sequence of the
                    B-tubulin gene is organized into 9 exons spanning 3.8 kbp (kilobase pairs). The
                    gene expresses an mRNA of 1.8 kbp which codes for a predicted protein of 448
                    amino acids. The amino acid sequence of the B-tubulin gene shares 89%, 87% and
                    93% similarity with the Caenorhabditis elegans B-tubulins, tubfil, mec-7 and
                    ben-1, respectively. Southern hybridization analyses show banding patterns
                    consistent with a single B-tubulin gene when the homologous sequence is used as
                    a probe under stringent hybridization conditions. Western blot analyses using
                    polyclonal rabbit antisera raised against a peptide coding the divergent 18
                    amino acids of the predicted f- tubulin carboxy-terminus show isoform patterns
                    identical to those found with a species cross-reactive monoclonal antibody
                    (Amersham), which recognizes a conserved epitope.</p>
                <p>These data suggest that the B. pahangi B-tubulin gene we have characterized
                    accounts for the major B-tubulin isoforms; however, the possibility of an
                    additional fB-tubulin gene in the B. pahangi genome cannot be excluded since
                    Southern hybridization analyses using either the homologous sequence or a

                    experiments we studied the process of the loss of gametocyte production in
                    clones of Plasmodium berghei. During prolonged periods of asexual multiplication
                    in mice we determined at regular intervals gametocyte production, karyotype

                    experimentally mixed gametocyte producer parasites and non- producer parasites
                    to visualize and quantitate competition between these parasites.</p>
                <p>We found that: 1. The capacity to produce gametocytes is an unstable
                    characteristic, readily subject to mutation. 2. Non- producer parasites have a
                    strong selective advantage over gametocyte producers during asexual
                    multiplication. 3. The time of appearance of non-producer parasites in a
                    population originating from a producer clone can differ substantially, from 10
                    to 60 weeks of asexual multiplication. 4. The loss of the capacity to produce
                    gametocytes often coincides with a change in the molecular karyotype.</p>

                    colubriformis, benzimidazole, tubulin, DNA The effectiveness of benzimidazole
                    (BZ) compounds as anthelmintics is due to their biochemical action of binding to
                    the structural protein tubulin and inhibiting the rate of formation of polymeric
                    microtubules. BZ resistance in nematodes has been shown to be due to a change in
                    the site of action which reduces the effectiveness with which the drug binds to
                    the protein. The mutations responsible for resistance can be identified through
                    comparisons of the nucleotide sequences encoding resistant and susceptible
                    tubulin and changes in protein structure deduced from the genetic code.</p>

                <p>Trypanosoma brucei, differentiation, antibody-dependent immunity There are two
                    morphological types of bloodstream trypanosome. "Slender" forms divide, are
                    responsible for population growth and give rise to “"stumpy" forms that do not
                    divide and are infective to the tsetse fly vector. Within each of the waves that
                    characterize a trypanosome infection, slender forms predominate over stumpy
                    forms as the parasitaemia increases and the converse occurs during remission. We
                    have investigated the causes of this change of predominance. Observation of the
                    changes in absolute, rather than relative, abundance show that the change in
                    predominance is not caused by an increase in stumpy form production but rather
                    by a decrease in the numbers of slender forms. This decrease could be caused by
                    limitations on the rate of division of slender forms or by an increase in their
                    mortality rate. Evidence against the former possibility is that challenge
                    infections given to mice at the peak of a parasitaemic wave grow at rates that
                    do not significantly differ from those of primary infections. Evidence to
                    support the latter explanation comes from the observation that, in vitro,
                    slender forms are approximately five times more susceptible than stumpy forms to
                    killing by antibody-dependent complement-mediated lysis. We propose, therefore,
                    that, in vivo, early antibody responses selectively kill slender forms causing a
                    change in the relative proportions of the two types of trypanosomes and that as
                    immunity develops both forms are killed causing parasitaemic remission.</p>

                    kinetoplast DNAs (kDNA) of six strains of Trypanosoma evansi from different
                    areas(4 from China,i from Ethiopia and 1 from the Philippines). All strains are
                    characterized by the absence of maxicircies as determined by southern blotting.
                    Two strains from China lack the minicircies. The electrophoretic analysis of the
                    minicircies digested with various restriction endonuclieases ciearly shows that
                    ali the kinetoplastic strains are not heterogeneous in minicircie sequence
                    except the Philippine strain which has two types of molecules, differing only at
                    one Hinf I restriction site. The nucleotide sequence analysis indicates that the
                    minicircies consist of many different 4 or 5 bp repeats and extensive homologies
                    exist among the different strains. We propose that the heterogeneity of the
                    Philippine strain is probably the result of mutation.</p>

                <p>The gene fragment produced by this PCR has been shown to be of a significantly

                    determined: a) total amount of protein and DNA per cell type; b) polypeptide
                    patterns after polyacrylamide electrophoresis(SDS-PAGE); c) relative contents of
                    alpha-tubulin by quantitative west- ern blots with a monoclonal antibody;

                    alpha-tubulin after metabolic labelling with radioac- tive methionine and
                    immunoprecipitation with a monoclonal antibody. The results indica- ted that
                    upon differentiation of E to M there was a 2.5 fold decrease in total protein
                    content, primarily at the expense of polypeptides with Mr in the range of 50K to
                    15K.</p>
                <p>The amount of alpha-tubulin per parasite form, however, was not affected, but its
                    specific mRNA gradually decreased, down to 4 fold: during the growth cycle of E.
                    We concluded then, that the regulation of gene expression of tubulin during this
                    process of differentiation is most likelyexerted at the post-transcriptional and
                    post-transla- tional level.</p>

                    variation, African trypanosome, Trypanosoma equiperdum The African trypanosomes
                    evade elimination by the host immune system via a complex system of antigenic
                    variation. The single variable surface glycoprotein (VSG) that forms the coat of
                    the trypanosome can be changed by the activation of a series of VSG genes.
                    During infection this activation usually involves a gene conversion-like process
                    that creates and inserts a copy of the new antigen gene into an expression site.
                    Studies of the gene coding for VSG 78, an antigen expressed late in a T.
                    equiperdum infection, showed that the active gene is a complex gene containing
                    pieces from at least three different pseudogenes. The region coding for the
                    exposed epitopes was created as a patchwork of segments from different genes in
                    the same gene family (Roth, et.al., PNAS 86:9375). This result suggested that
                    the exposed VSG epitopes might be changed by gene conversions that replaced
                    expressed epitopes with those from other members of the same gene family. To
                    test this hypothesis, monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) were selected that killed
                    trypanosomes expressing VSG 78 and these MAbs were use to select variants that
                    had altered the recognized epitope. The active VSG genes from the MAb-resistant
                    variants were cloned and sequenced to determine the molecular mechanism used to
                    alter the epitopes. Two independent isolates resistant to the MAb H3 were found
                    to have changed serine 192 to arginine though by different nucleotide
                    alterations. In both cases the change was due to a mutation in the active copy
                    of the gene and not to a gene conversion. À variant resistant to MAb H7 had a
                    series of amino acid changes some of which were the result of a gene
                    conversion-like process while other changes were due to mutations. Thus in the
                    case of VSG 78, the active copy of the gene undergoes changes resulting both
                    from mutations and gene conversions but no direct evidence was found that
                    demonstrated resistance to antibody killing due to small gene conversion
                    events.</p>

                    Genetics, RFLPs, drug resistance The resistance of Plasmodium falciparum to
                    chloroquine treatment is a growing public health problem worldwide. One
                    mechanism of this resistance has been identified: the overexpression of the
                    multidrug resistance gene in parasites which have been selected by a gradual
                    increase in the concentration of chloroquine. Our goal is to understand the
                    mechanism of action of chloroquine using somatic cell genetics. We are selecting
                    in culture P. falciparum mutants which have become resistant to the drug in a
                    single step. As a first step, we have developed a rapid method for typing
                    strains and clones of P. falciparum using RFLPS. DNA is prepared in agar blocks,
                    digested with appropriate restriction enzymes, separated and blotted to nylon
                    filters. The blots are probed with oligonucleotides from conserved regions of
                    the following genes: RESA, HRP l, HRP 11/111, CSP, S-Ag, gp 195 and mdr. The
                    method requires only a small volume of parasites, and a modest time input. It
                    gives a quick molecular profile of each clone, and facilitates the molecular
                    analysis of mutants selected in culture.</p>
                <p>It could be equally useful as a rapid method for identifying and following
                    isolates taken from field samples, or for monitoring cultures during routine

                <p>Genetic exchange occurs when two stocks of T.brucei are co-transmitted through
                    tsetse flies. Results of the analysis of progeny clones from three such crosses
                    using both isoenzyme and single copy gene markers will be presented. These
                    results show that allelic segregation and recombination between loci are central
                    features of the genetic exchange system and, therefore, that meiosis occurs. We
                    have used such progeny clones in order to determine how the three major classes
                    of chromosome (mini, intermediate and large) are inherited. The chromosomes have
                    been separated by pulse field gel electrophoresis and conditions determined for
                    the separation of the 59-100 mini-chromosomes, the 2-3 intermediate chromosomes
                    and a set of large chromosomes of 1-3Mb. On the basis of the ethidium bromide
                    stained pattern and a series of chromosome specific gene probes, we have
                    identified the homologous chromosomes in the 1-SMb region and shown that they
                    segregate and recombine in the progeny. The intermediate chromosomes are
                    inherited in a non- mendelian manner, while the mini-chromosomes are inherited
                    additively. These results show that the large chromosomes are inherited in a
                    manner consistent with meiosis while the intermediate and mini-chromosomes are
                    inherited in a non-mendelian manner, suggesting that they do not take part in

                    had an identical nucleotide change at amino acid 223 (Phe to Ser) of DHFR. One
                    of those mutants, FCR3-D8, was further selected at a higher concentration of
                    pyrimethamine and subcloned. One selected mutant, FCR3-D81, that grew at 1x1076
                    M pyrimethamine, contained a single point mutation in the DHFR domain at amino
                    acid 223, whereas another mutant, FCR3-D85, that grew at 5x10-6 M pyrimethamine
                    had an additional point mutation that changed amino acid 54 (Asp to Asn). The
                    chromosome patterns of those mutants were examined. FCR3-D81 and FCR3- D85 cells
                    each contained different pairs of polymorphic chromosomes. These polymorphic
                    chromosomes each hybridized to a DHFR-TS probe as well as other chromosome 4
                    specific DNAs, indicating that at least part of chromosome 4 had been duplicated
                    and that these parasites were anuploid with 15 father than 14 chromosomes. We
                    consider the relation- ships of polymorphic chromosome duplications and DHFR

                    expression Two distinct B-tubulin genes have been isolated and sequenced from a
                    benzimidazole (BZ)- susceptible Haemonchus contortus egg cDNA library. The
                    predicted amino acid sequences of both B-tubulins are 448 residues long. These
                    fB-tubulin cDNAs have been used to probe genomic DNA from BZ-susceptible (S) and
                    resistant (R) H. contortus strains. DNA from S and R H. contortus eggs was
                    digested with EcoRI, Sphl, Spel and Hind III restriction enzymes and subjected
                    to Southern blot analysis. The restriction enzyme patterns between S and R
                    strains were different for each B-tubulin probe. The results indicate that there
                    is at least one f-tubulin gene that is different between the S and R strains and
                    are consistent with resistance being associated with a loss of one B-tubulin
                    gene.</p>
                <p>Northern blot analysis of mRNA from S and R H. contortus eggs indicated that the
                    levels of mRNA are similar between these strains. B-tubulin was expressed in
                    vitro by transcription and translation of a cDNA tubulin gene from S H.

                    electrophoresis and Western blot using a B-tubulin monoclonal antibody. The in
                    vitro expressed f-tubulin was shown to bind Pa oxibendazole.</p>

                <p>S. marsoni - tegumental protein - fusion protein - protein purification The 15 kD
                    peptide is a major protein of the tegument of S. mansoni. It is highly
                    processed, as suggested by the size of its encoding cDNA. We here report data
                    concerned with the expression of different parts of this cDNA as a
                    glutathione-S-transferase (GST) fusion protein and the purification of the S.
                    mansoni peptide after cleavage of the fusion protein. The open reading frame of
                    the cDNA (1041 bp} and its 5' and (510 bp) were cloned in pGEX-2T and the genes
                    expressed in E. coli TG2. After purification of the fusion protein by
                    glutathione affinity chromatography and cleavage with thrombin, the S. mansoni
                    protein could be separated by affinity chromatography. The 5' end of the gene
                    expressed a stable fusion protein in large amounts, whereas the whole open
                    reading frame expressed an unstable protein with many degradative products. In
                    conclusion, the cloning and expressing of different parts of the gene in pGEX
                    expression vectors can be a useful approach to obtaining stable and pure
                    recombinant proteins. These proteins are being used to raise high titre

                <p>The genes of Caenorhabditis elegans as well as of Ascaris suum which code for the

                    University, West Mains Road, Edinburgh EH9 3JN, UK Work is in progress to clone
                    P. falciparum genes encoding sexual stage surface proteins. Our primary interest
                    in these proteins is their potential in transmission blocking immunity but we
                    are also interested in their role in host-parasite interactions. One such
                    protein being investigated is of molecular weight 17kD and is present in
                    gametocytes and on the gamete and zygote surface. The monoclonal antibody (Mab)
                    2G7, which recognises a reduced and denatured epitope on this protein has been
                    used to screen a recombinant gametocyte cDNA library in E. coli. One clone,
                    2G7.15, isolated using this Mab contains about 400bp of P. falciparum sequences
                    with an uninterrupted open reading frame, capable of coding for 93 amino acids
                    (about 10kD) of the C-terminus of a protein which contains a putative
                    hydrophobic transmembrane domain. Oligonucleotides designed from the 267.15
                    sequence recognise two discrete bands of 1.3 and 0.9kb on a Southern blot of
                    Rsal digested P.</p>
                <p>falciparum DNA. This is consistent with the presence of an Rsal site in the
                    2G7.15 sequence. Work is in progress to isolate the complete coding region of
                    the gene by screening cDNA and genomic libraries with the oligonucleotides, and
                    also to demonstrate that this sequence codes for the 17kD protein.</p>

                    City, Iowa 52242 USA Ascaris suum - neutral lipids - epicuticle - Nematoda The
                    outermost layer of the cuticle of nematodes (the epicuticle) is a thin,
                    electron- dense film which some authors have suggested may be composed of lipid.
                    We extracted lipids from the epicuticle of adult A. suum by dipping worms for
                    short time periods (30-90 seconds) in chloroform-methanol (2:1, v:v),
                    characterized the extracted neutral lipids by thin-layer chromatography (TLC)
                    and examined extracted cuticles by trans- mission electron microscopy (TEM) to
                    determine the effects of lipid extraction on cuticular morphology. TLC of the
                    neutral lipids resolved at least ten lipids, five of which were present in
                    appreciable amounts. Cholesterol, accounting for about 30% of the total neutral
                    lipid fraction, was the only lipid identifiable by comparison with authentic
                    standards (cholesterol oleate, triolein, diacylglycerols and oleic acid) or witb
                    the lipids of A. suum female reproductive tissues. Thus, the major cuticular
                    lipids are not ascarosides or their esters. Because the cuticles of A. suum
                    often harbor colonies of bacteria, the lipids of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, a
                    common cuticular symbiont, were compared to worm lipids and found to be totally
                    different in TLC mobilities.</p>
                <p>Comparisons of extracted and unextracted worms by TEM revealed no discernible
                    changes in the morphology of the epicuticle. Instead, chloroform-methanol
                    extraction appeared to cause a distinct decrease in electron-density of the
                    outer cortical layer, a 2-3 um region immediately beneath the epicuticle. These
                    results suggest that the epicuticle does not contain significant amounts of
                    lipid and that the major source of the complex mixture of lipids in the cuticle
                    of A. suum is the outer cortical layer.</p>

                    antigen - cross-reactivity The rapid growth of Trypanosoma brucei brucei in the
                    blood requires the receptor-mediated endocytosis of LDL from its host, and is
                    slowed down by a monospecific rabbit antiserum against the purified LDL receptor
                    of the parasite (Coppens et al, 1988, PNAS 85:6753). In search of a vaccine
                    against African trypanosomiasis, we have studied the expression of the receptor
                    in several well-characterized variants (117a, 117d, 118a, 120b, 224) and have
                    used the antiserum to examine whether the LDL receptor of T, brucei brucei is a
                    stable surface antigen, common to all strains of the parasite despite antigenic
                    variation of its major surface glycoprotein, and whether it is immunologically
                    distinct from the LDL receptor of the host. Binding of rat LDL at 4°C to all
                    variants was specific and was saturable at =60,000 molecules per cell with a Kd
                    =1 M. The binding at 4°C of 20-80 nM rat LDL to different variants of
                    trypanosomes and to isolated rat hepatocytes was inhibited to the same extent
                    (-70 to -90 %) by the antiserum. In double immunodiffusion, the antiserum
                    produced a single precipitation line, showing continuity between the extracts of
                    all variants, as well as between trypanosomes and mammalian extracts.</p>
                <p>In Western blots of trypanosome extracts, the LDL receptor was strongly labeled
                    as a single band of Mr 86,000, whereas in the rat liver extract, a single band
                    of Mr 130,000 was weakly labeled at a high concentration of the antiserum. In
                    conclusion, the LDL receptor of T. brucei brucei is present in all variants
                    studied, is a stable surface antigen despite variation of the major surface
                    glycoprotein, but shows a great similarity with the LDL receptor of the host.
                    Further work with monoclonal antibodies is required to search for
                    parasite-specific epitopes.</p>

                    Malaria- P,vivax- Surface antigen- DNA sequence A high molecular weight (180-230
                    kDa) precursor to a major merozoite surface antigen CPMMSA) has been shown to
                    constitute a vaccine candidate of interest in several mlarial species. The gene
                    coding for this parasite protein has been characterized in P.falciparum and
                    P,yoelii and we have previously reported the sequence of part the gene in
                    P,yivax. Ve here present the complete primary structure of the gene coding for
                    the PMMSA of the Belem strain of P,vivax. As in P,falciparum and P,yoelii, the
                    P,vivax PMMSA gene contains a cystein-rich region ( 11 cystein residues
                    distributed over a 102 amino-acid segment) at its carboxy terminal end ; such
                    conservation between species suggests that this part of the molecule plays an
                    important role in structure or function of the antigen.</p>
                <p>Sequence comparison of the PMMSA gene of different P,falciparum strains bas
                    revealed that it is composed of conserved, semi conserved and polymorphic
                    regions. The polymorphic regions seem to be evolutionary products of few
                    ancestral alleles. In the case of P,vivax, using monoclonal antibodies we had
                    shown that indeed the PMMSA is polymorphic; to ïinitiate studies of polymorphism
                    at the genetic level and to determine the extent of allelic polymorphism of the
                    vivax PMMSA gene, a 1.5 kB DNA fragment was amplified by PCR in a Sri Lankan
                    strain of P,vivax and its sequence was compared to that of the Belem strain.
                    Number of first and second base position variations as well as the appearance or
                    disappearance of several codons were detected in the Sri Lankan isolate.</p>

                    stage specific and common surface antigens have been found in Brugia malayi.
                    Among the microfilarial parasites, we have compared sheathed and exsheathed
                    microfilariae, particularly with respect to a 65-70 kKDa triplet. Infective
                    larvae show a very different surface profile to microfilariae, but two shared
                    components include a 17-200 kDa complex, and a 15 kDa surface protein which may
                    be conserved throughout the developmental cycle.</p>
                <p>The majority of infective larval surface proteins are recognised by infected
                    human and animal sera. However, certain antibodies which show differential
                    binding to the larval surface in immunofluorescence assays do not bind
                    surface-labelled proteins; we are currently exploring if glycolipid or other
                    non-protein molecules are acting as the target of these antibodies.</p>

                    FALCIPARUM INFECTED RED BLOOD CELLS.</p>
                <p>Grellier P., Rigomier D., Clavey V., Fruchart J.C. and Schrével J. Muséum Several
                    intraerythrocytic growth cycles of Plasæodium falciparum were achieved in vitro
                    using a serum-free medium supplemented only with the human high density lipopro-
                    tein (HDL) fraction (d=1.063-1.210). The parasitaemia obtained was similar to
                    that in standard culture medium containing 5 % human serum. The lipid traffic
                    from HDL to the infected erythrocytes was demonstrated by pulse-labelling
                    experiments using HDL loaded either with fluorescent phosphatidylcholine
                    (NBD-PC) or radioactive [3H]-palmitoyl-PC.</p>
                <p>At 379C, the lipid probes were rapidly accumulated in the infected cells. After
                    incuba- tion with PC labelled HDL, a postincubation with an excess of native HDL
                    or 20 % human serum induced the disappearance of the label from the erythrocyte
                    plasma membrane but not from the intraerythrocytic parasite. Internalization of
                    lipids did not occur at 4°C.</p>
                <p>The absence of P. falciparum labelling with HDL 125-I iodinated on their
                    apolipoproteins or with antibodies against the apolipoproteins À I and À II by
                    immunofluorescence and immunoblotting, implies an unidirectional flux of lipids
                    but no endocytosis via apolipo- proteins. By fluorescence videomicroscopy,
                    numerous organelles labelled with NBD-PC were moving between the parasitophorous
                    and the erythrocyte membranes. The intensity of the lipid traffic is
                    stage-dependent, with a maxiaum at the 36th hr of the erythrocyte life cycle,
                    and a conversion of the PC to phosphatidylethanolamine was observed in infected
                    erythrocytes. In conclusion, the HDL fraction appears to be a major lipid source
                    for the Plasrodium falciparum growth in erythrocytes.</p>

                <p>A surface antigen 3 Theileria annulata sporozoites has been characterized using a
                    monoclonal antibody (1A7) . This antibody inhibits in vitro penetration of
                    sporozoites into peripheral blood mononuclear cells. In western blots a series
                    of bands of 115,85, 72,63 and 54 kDa are recognised. Cell free-translation has
                    demonstrated that the 115 kDa molecule is a precursor of the other peptides. The
                    gene for this antigen has been iso- lated from a Àgtll library, and rabbit sera
                    against the expressed product inhibit sporo- zoite penetration in vitro.
                    Sequencing studies have revealed the presence of tandem repeats of the sequences
                    VPGVG at two locations in the protein. Attempts are now being made to express
                    the complete protein in bacteria or yeast, from cDNA clones, in order to
                    facilitate the epitope mapping of this antigen, and the progress of these
                    studies will be reported.</p>

                <p>Leishmania mexicana - Cell surface antigens In the present study a biochemical
                    and immunological characterization of the proteins expossed on the surface of
                    radioiodinated L. mexicana promastigotes was carried out. By means of SDS-PAGE
                    followed by autoradiography we demonstrated, under reduced conditions, the
                    presence of three iodinated polypeptides: one major component of 50 kDa and two
                    minor ones, 65 and 27 kDa. Under non-reducing conditions, only the 65 kDa
                    iodinated component underwent a large shift in migration (to 59 kDa) while the
                    electrophoretic behavior of the other two remain the same. Peptide digestion
                    profiles of the 65 and 50 kDa polypeptides showed à complete lack of homology
                    between the maps obtained, implicating that both polypeptides are structurally
                    different. Furthermore, these structural differences correlate with the
                    enzymatic activities of acid phosphatase and protease detected at the L.
                    mexicana cell surface: the 50 kDa component is responsible for the acid
                    phosphatase activity whereas the 65 kDa one was characterized as the structural
                    polypeptide of the surface protease. The different immunochemical nature of L.
                    mexicana surface components was further demonstrated using different
                    anti-Leishmania Sera. Rabbit anti-promastigote antiserum procipitated mainly the
                    50 and 27 kDa surface components whereas rabbit anti- amastigote serum as well
                    as serum from à patient with cutaneous leishmaniasis immunoprecipitated almost
                    exclusively the 65 kDa polypeptide. These results altogether demonstrate the
                    heterogeneity in the expression of antigens as well as of the enzymatic
                    activities they display on the L. mexicana cell-surface.</p>

                    protein, receptor Human erythrocytes lacking Duffy blood group antigens are
                    refractory to invasion by P. vivax and P, knowlesi merozoites. Previously a 135
                    kDa protein that binds to the Duffy erythrocyte antigen in a receptor-like
                    manner was described in P, knowlesi and P,._ vivax. Now cDNA clones to the Duffy
                    binding protein in P, knowlesi have been identified and isolated by screening a
                    P, knowlesi lamda gtll expression library with affinity purified anti-Duffy
                    receptor antibodies. Specific antisera were generated to fusion proteins from
                    two non-cross hybridizing fragments, DR.1 and DR.2, of a sequenced cDNA clone.
                    Antisera to both fusion proteins immunprecipitated the 135 kDa protein from
                    culture supernatant. Sequence data from the cDNA clone identified a
                    transmembrane segment followed by a cytoplasmic tail consistent with the
                    function of a receptor molecule. Southern blot analysis (PFGE and restriction
                    digested genomic DNA) identified 3 homologous genes with sequence differences
                    detected by hybridization of oligonucleotide probes. From in vitro translation
                    of mRNA it appears that only a single gene is expressed. An in vitro translated
                    180 kDa protein was consistently immunoprecipitated by antisera to DR.1 and DR.2
                    fusion proteins. An antisense oligonucleotide, specific for only one gene,
                    blocked the synthesis of the 180 kDa protein. In conlusion the gene encoding the
                    135 kDa binding protein of P, knowlesi is part of a gene family with only one
                    gene producing the precursor protein of 180 kDa.</p>

                <p>Trypanosoma cruzi antigens are polymorphic. To better understand this a large
                    family of cCDNA clones, which are recognized by chronically infected mouse serum
                    (CIMS), has been partially analyzed. Sequence analysis of 10 clones revealed
                    open reading frames with 60-80% sequence homology, interrupted by short
                    nonhomologous regions. Probes to the unique region permitted the localization of
                    some members of the gene family to telomeres. All probes revealed a 5.0 kilobase
                    message, specific for the mammalian stage of the parasite. Antibodies against
                    the cDNA clones and specific epitopes were selected from CIMS. Western analysis
                    revealed antigens of 85 kilodaltons (kd). Radioimmune precipitation of surface
                    antigens revealed a single major band at 85 kd. Immunoflouresence with
                    epitope-specific antibodies revealed surface staining of mammalian stage
                    specific forms. The data suggests the existence of a large, diverse, family of
                    surface antigens, specifically expressed in the mammalian stage.</p>

                <p>Leishmania promastigotes - Surface enzymatic activities.</p>
                <p>In the present work we carried out a comparative study of different New and Old
                    World Leishmania in terms of the enzymatic activities (protease and acid
                    phosphatase) displayed at the surface of Leishmania promastigotes and the
                    expression of the cell-surface antigenic components responsible for the above
                    mentioned activities. It was found that each of the stains tested differ in the
                    expression of the enzymatic activities displayed at the surface of the cell i.e.
                    in L. major and L.b.panamensis a high level of protease activity and a low level
                    of acid phosphatase, in L.mexicana a 1ow level of protease and a high level of
                    acid phosphatase and in L.b.braziliensis, an intermediate level of protease and
                    a high level of acid phosphatase activity. Furthermore, a great variability in
                    the expression of surface polypeptides was also observed, as assesed by the
                    surface iodination protein profiles and confirmed by structural and
                    immunological analysis. Of particular interest was the finding that simple
                    iodination patterns correlate with a high surface protease activity, associated
                    with the expression of one polypeptide (63-65 kDa for L.major and
                    L.b.panamensis), whereas more complex iodination patterns correlate with a high
                    surface acid phosphatase activity, associated with the expression of a distinct
                    polypeptide (50 kDa for L.mexicana), with the exception of L.b.braziliensis
                    which only express a 72 kDa surface polypeptide probablv responsible for both
                    activities. This variability suggests that different surface entities may be
                    involved in host-parasite interaction and survival depending on the infecting
                    Leishmania strain. It could also be used as à tool for parasite identification
                    and diagnosis of leishmaniasis.</p>

                    00137 Rome, Italy Schistosoma mansoni - Surface antigen - Cloning We have
                    previously shown that surface labeling of 3-hour schistosomula with
                    lactoperoxidase catalyzed iodination results in the preferential accumulation of
                    radioactivity in a protein of approximately 18 KDa. This protein is
                    stage-specific, since it is no longer labeled in lung forms or in adult
                    parasites. Taking advantage of the peculiar solubility of the 18 KDa protein in
                    thrichloroacetic acid, we were able to purify sufficient amounts of it to obtain
                    a specific rabbit antiserum and a partial aminoacid sequence. Biosynthetic
                    labeling experiments using radioactive methionine as a precursor showed that
                    immunoprecipitable material of the expected molecular size could only be
                    obtained from infected snaïl sporocysts, while it was absent in 3-hour
                    schistosomula or older forms. Poly-A* RNA was isolated from infected sporocysts
                    and was shown to direct the synthesis of immunoprecipitable material
                    corresponding to the 18 KDa protein. A cCDNA library was constructed from this
                    RNA in the expression vector Agtil and was screened using the specific rabbit
                    antiserum. Positive clones were isolated and the production of the 18 KDa
                    protein was confirmed by Western blotting. The insert of one of the clones was
                    amplified using the polymerase chain reaction and sequenced using the dideoxy
                    chain termination method. At the same time, the fusion protein produced in Agt1
                    1 was isolated and injected into mice to test its immunoprotective activity.</p>

                    domestic dogs and cats were infected with alveolar hydatid cysts from white mice
                    which had been given alveolar hydatid cysts from naturally infected Myospalax

                    from both dog and cat re-infected to mice, and the mature alveolar hydatid cysts
                    were recovered. The eggs of E. multilocularis were first seen in the dog feces
                    39 days after infection, but the peak number of eggs were found within 60 to 90
                    days. It was found that the most of adult.</p>
                <p>mainly occurred in the small intestine of both hosts. From a dog in autopsy at 39
                    days after infection, there were 1,257 worms in the ileum, 957 in the jejunum
                    and 895 in the duodenum. Besides, the post-mortem made on a cat infected by 15
                    days, 717 adults were seen in the ileum, 611 in the jejunum and 503 in the
                    duodenum. After comparison between the adult numbers, the egg numbers in the

                <p>The tissue-chemistry studies showed that the medulla of adult and its protoscolex

                    layers of fertile and steril cysts also had glycogen in plenty, but the cvary,
                    rostellar hooks and egg shell were absent of glycogen. There were rich

                <p>Brugia malayi third stage larvae possess a species-specific surface epitope
                    recognized by à monoclonal antibody DI1E5. The epitope is expressed transiently
                    by the parasite during the period of transmission from the insect to vertebrate
                    host.</p>
                <p>Numerous attempts to identify this antigen using a variety of immunochemical
                    techniques have been unsuccessful. Since the epitope is first detected on the
                    surface of the second stage larvae of B. malayi, it is most likely synthesized
                    at this time; therefore, we are constructing a PCR-based cDNA library from this
                    stage of the parasite.</p>
                <p>The method involves isolation of total RNA from a small number of second stage
                    larvae dissected from the thoracic muscles of mosquitoes. The first cDNA strand
                    is synthesized from total RNA by conventional means using an oligo(dT) primer.
                    After tailing with terminal transferase and dGTP, the cDNA is amplified by PCR
                    using two primers complementary to oligo(dA) and oligo(dG) ends. The amplified
                    cDNA is then clone into a bacteriophage À expression vector. The resulting
                    library will be screened with the D1ES antibody. This method may be more
                    generally applied to other systems in which limited parasite material has
                    hindered the construction of cDNA libraries.</p>

                <p>To isolate these antigens a lambda gtll cDNA library was screened with antisera
                    from dogs that had been immunized with irradiated L3s of Dirofilariae immitis.
                    One recombinant antigen, recognized by the immune serum, was also recognized by
                    antisera to D, immitis L4s. Southern blot and DNA sequence analysis of genomic
                    DNA led to the surprising observation that this antigen is organized as 25 or
                    more units of a 399 bp direct tandem repeat. Pulse-chase studies, followed by
                    immunoprecipation of the protein, indicate that the antigen is made as a high
                    molecular weight precursor [over 300 kD] and is cleaved to give a ladder like
                    array with the bands 15-16 kD apart. Antisera made against the D, immitis
                    recombinant antigen cross-reacts with a Bolton-Hunter iodinated protein of
                    Brugia malayi. The location of the antigen in sections of D, immitis female was
                    visualized in the electron microscope with the aid of immunogold. The antigen
                    was in the hypodermis and throughout the cuticle. The protective ability of the

                    report the isolation and identification of a new gene of P. falciparum, denoted
                    Pfs16, which is transcriptionally active in the sexual stages but silent in the
                    asexual erythrocytic bloodstages of the parasite. The Pfs16 gene encodes a
                    protein of 157 amino acids in which characteristic peptide-repeats are absent.
                    As the protein has structural features characteristic for a membrane protein,
                    the Pfs16 gene product might be a potential candidate for the development of a
                    malaria vaccine.</p>
                <p>Rabbit antisera raised against a synthetic peptide of the 16 kDa protein have
                    been used to localize the corresponding antigen in the sexual and asexual
                    parasitic forms. A 16 kDa antigen was detected in both the protein extracts of
                    gametocytes and macrogamete/zygotes by Western blot analysis. The same antigen
                    was also detected in protein extracts of sporozoites. Antibodies raised against
                    the synthetic peptide also reacted with dried gametes and gametocytes and with
                    sporozoites in a standard immunofluoresence assay.</p>
                <p>By immuno-electron microscopy using the protein A-gold method the 16 kDa protein
                    could be clearly visualized in the gametocyte and macrogamete membrane as well
                    as on the sporozoite surface membrane, whereas the antigen was not detectable in
                    the asexual erythrocytic stages of the parasite. To determine the prospects of

                <p>Recent studies from our group have suggested that surface antigens of Giardia
                    lamblia play a role in parasite attachment to epithelial cells. In particular,
                    an antigen of ap- proximately 65 Kd has been identified and seems to be a major
                    surface antigen component of this parasite. To further characterize this surface
                    molecule, as well as to understand its expression, a recombinant clone from a G.
                    lamblia cDNA library prepared in Àgtll vas isolated using a rabbit serum
                    prepared against the 65 Kd surface molecule. The fusion polypeptide expressed by
                    the recombinant clone, upon induction with IPTG, has a molecular weight of
                    approximately 140 Kd as determined by SDS-PAGE and Western blot analysis. South
                    ern hybridization analysis of total parasite DNA digested with various
                    endonucleases, to the cDNA insert suggest that the 65 Kd antigen is encoded by
                    multiple closely related --- genes. Sequencing analysis revealed that the insert
                    has 572 base pairs and contains 60 Z G/C. The cloned DNA insert encodes for a
                    peptide composed of 190 aminoacid residues that has an apparent M.W. of 19 Kd.
                    Hydrophobicity plot of this polypeptide showed a -- high number of hydrophilic
                    domains. The aminoacid sequence derived from the DNA sequence of the cDNA clone
                    revealed that it has a high (11%) percentage of cysteine residues. We are
                    currently characterizing this clone by Northern analysis.</p>

                    Furthermore, these antibodies recognize the expressed RCb clones, and molecular

                    variant surface glycoprotein (VSG), epitopes In order to characterize
                    immunodominant epitopes monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) against three VSGs were
                    raised in mice. 11 mAbs were obtained against BeNat 1-, 5 against BeNat 1.2-,
                    and 7 against BeNat 1.3-VSG. The reactivity of the antibodies with the cor-
                    responding proteins was analyzed by dot blot and western blot procedures. The
                    results can be summarized as follows: 1. A11 mAbs bind to enzymatically
                    deglycosylated VSG equally well, indicating that the N-glycans of the proteins
                    are not immunogenic.</p>
                <p>2. None of the mAbs detects the cross reacting determinant being present in all
                    VSGs, and being part of the membrane anchoring structure of the molecules.</p>
                <p>3. AI1 mAbs react with denatured VSG, thus all epitopes belong to the
                    "sequence'"- and not to the "conformational'"-type.</p>
                <p>&amp;. By the method of "limited proteolysis" 5 different epitopes could be
                    defined for BeNat 1-VSG, 4 for BeNat 1.2-VSG, and 7 for BeNat 1.3-VSG.</p>
                <p>5. Besides one exception in each case all mAbs show positive reactivity with the
                    cell surface both in indirect immunofluorescence and in cell agglutination
                    tests.</p>
                <p>Despite of antigenic differences due to amino acid sequence variations the
                    general reactivity of the mAbs with the individual proteins seems to be similar,
                    indicative probably for conserved structural principles within VSGs.</p>

                <p>Promastigotes of all Leishmania spp. have been shown to express a surface
                    protease, gp63. This abundant glycoprotein possesses site- specific
                    endopeptidase activity, and is also capable of mediating attachment to the
                    macrophage. Analysis of gp63 expression throughout the parasite's life cycle has
                    shown that the glycoprotein is expressed, but differentially processed and
                    localized, in the amastigote stage.</p>
                <p>Amastigote gp63 is glycosylated differently from the form found in promastigotes.
                    In addition, the majority of the protein apparently lacks the
                    phosphatidylinositol membrane anchor, whether through by-passing processing or
                    cleavage after processing is unclear. Differential labelling procedures, in
                    conjunction with immunoelectron microscopy, indicate that the "soluble" form of
                    gp63 is localized in the lumen of the amastigote flagellar pocket. Although the
                    majority of gp63 in amastigotes is not situated on the cell plasmalemma,
                    experiments combining metabolic labelling and surface-derivatization with
                    NHS-biotin, suggest that gp63 is the most abundant protein exposed on the
                    amastigote surface. Heterogeneity has also been found within the genes encoding
                    gp63 in L.mexicana and the possible relevance of these differences to the
                    heterogeneity found at the protein level is at present under examination.</p>

                    times faster than rat plasma proteins. These preliminary data suggested the

                    polymorphism presents a barrier to any succesfull vaccination. As laboratory
                    established lines probably do not reflect the field situation, we have analysed,
                    by the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) the allelic distribution of the major
                    merozoite surface antigen (p190) in wild isolates taken directly from Brazilian
                    patients. Sequence analysis and oligonucleotide typing of the PCR products
                    following separation on agarose demonstrated that a third form of p190, which is
                    very conserved among distinct parasite isolates, is found in 53% of the
                    Brazilian malaria patients. This allelic type appears at low frequency in
                    laboratory strains. Thus, in Brazil, the allelic distribution was not that
                    predicted from the laboratory analysis. Finally, we show that the amplification
                    of the polymorphic 5’ end of the p190 gene can detect mixtures of genetically
                    distinct parasites in the blood of humans infected with malaria.</p>

                <p>Leishmania - Protease - Phosphatidylinositol - Membrane - Antigen The protozoan
                    parasite Leishmania expresses at its surface an abundant membrane-bound
                    metalloprotease of approximatively 63 kDa.This protease is anchored in the
                    plasma membrane by a glycosyl-phosphatidylinositol (GPI).</p>
                <p>The lipidated anchor was prepared and analysed using physical, chemical and
                    enzymatic methods. The structure of the GPI containing peptide was found to be:
                    Asp-Gly-Gly-Asn-ethanolamine-PO4-(6)Man(œi-2)Man(œl-6)Man(œl-
                    4)GIcN(œ)myo-inositol-1-PO4-(1-alkyl-2-acyl-glycerol). The glycan structure is
                    identical to the conserved glycan core regions of the GPI anchors of Trypanosoma
                    brucei variant surface glycoprotein (VSG) and rat brain Thy-1 antigen,
                    supporting the notion that this portion of GPIs is highly conserved. However,
                    the lack of phosphoethanolamine, acyl or carbohydrate side chains suggest that
                    this GPI might be the simplest structure that will be found in this type of
                    anchor. The four amino acids found at the COOH-terminus of the mature protease
                    are located 25 amino acids before the predicted COOH-terminus of the precursor
                    protein. The lipid composition differs significantly from those of the GPIs of
                    T,brucei VSG and mammalian erythrocyte acetylcholinesterase but is similar to
                    that of a family of glycosylated phosphoinositides found uniquely in the
                    leishmania.</p>

                <p>Leishmania- Promastigote- Metacyclogenesis- PNA receptors The relationship
                    between L. major cell surface PNA-receptors expressed under different conditions
                    and the virulence was studied. À virulent (Sch) and a non virulent (rbla) line
                    of L. major promastigotes at stationary phase of growth were isolated in
                    Schneider's medium and rabbit blood agar. After 90 days of inoculation into
                    susceptible BALB/c mice, none of the animals inoculated with rbla showed signs
                    of infection whereas all mice inoculated with Sch, either log or stationary
                    phase, were infected. It was found that stationary Sch promastigotes were more
                    infective than the log counterpart. The induced PNA agglutination of
                    promastigotes, either grown in Schneider's medium or rabbit blood agar,
                    increases along the log phase until it reaches the stationary phase, when in
                    both cases a decrease in the PNA induced agglutination was observed. However,
                    the degree of agglutination shown by both strains at log and stationary phase
                    was very similar despite differences in virulence. The increased PNA
                    agglutination of promastigotes along the log phase in Schneider's medium
                    correlated wi£h an increase in the number of PNA receptors as determined by
                    Scatchard analysis using 1251I-PNA and FITC-PNA. In contrast, a correlation
                    between the decreased PNA agglutination of Sch promastigotes at stationary phase
                    and the number of PNA receptors could not be established. UV-microscopic
                    observations of the population of Sch promastigotes at stationary phase
                    incubated with FITC-PNA, revealed however, that the 10-12% of total
                    promastigotes was not stained with FITC-PNA. These results altogether are
                    consistent with a developmentally regulated cell surface expression of PNA
                    receptors on L. major promastigotes during metacyclogenesis in vitro, which
                    seems to be independent of growth conditions, and also of the virulence of the
                    strain.</p>

                <p>The enzyme Acetylcholinesterase (ACRE) has been previously shown to be present in
                    all stages of the life cycle of Schistosoma mansoni. It is present in muscle
                    tissues and there is evidence that it is involved in neuromuscular transmission.
                    AChE has also been shown to be located on, and easily released from the surface
                    of these parasites since it is anchored to the membrane via covalently attached
                    phosphatidylinositol. A function for this surface/released ACHE is less easily
                    understood.</p>
                <p>Schistosoma haematobium andS.mansoni exhibit different in vivo susceptibilities
                    to the drug metrifonate which is thought to act via inhibition of AChE activity.
                    Short term in vitro exposure to metrifonate produces fully reversible paralysis
                    in both species at similar drug concentrations. This differential susceptibility
                    suggested that these species of schistosome might have differing requirements
                    for the enzyme, perhaps in its alternative role as a surface molecule. In this
                    study we compare the ACHE's of S.haematobium, S.bovis andS.mansoni and in terms
                    of location, stage specificity, molecular species and size, they are highly
                    conserved.</p>
                <p>However differences in the ratio of true- and pseudo- AChe's, in specific
                    activity and inhibitor sensitivity do suggest significant differences in these
                    parasites requirements for the enzyme.</p>

                    undergo.transbilayer movement and gain access to the parasite, but direct import
                    of PL from the serum, in situ, remains to be demons- trated and quantified.
                    Finally, this intensive and crucial PL metabolism is an ideal target for
                    chemotherapeutic attack (see Ancelin and Vial, in this congress). Information
                    now exists on the structural organization of lipids in host cell membranes,
                    demonstra- ting that overall lipid composition is not changed after infection.
                    In contrast, intra- erythrocytic parasite induces numerous changes in fatty acid
                    composition, particulary in PL molecular species in host cell membrane, and even
                    differences between uninfected and normal erythrocytes. The transbilayer
                    mobility of PL in malaria-infected erythro- cytes is greatly increased, but
                    there are small, or no, changes in their asymmetric distribution. Together, this
                    leads to PL packing modifications within the host membrane which could modulate
                    the lipid bilayer properties, perhaps increasing membrane permeability in order
                    to gain better access to nutrients. Lastly, this reflects the extensive
                    intracellular dynamics of lipids in infected erythrocytes associated with
                    intense membrane trafficking.</p>

                <p>A glycoprotein of 78.000 molecular weight (78kDa), associated with the membrane
                    of Leishmania infantum promastigotes was identified and immunopurified by
                    monoclonal antibody (mAb) LD9 produced against isolated membrane preparations.
                    mAb LD9 was subsequently found to bind to human transferrin. Sufficient
                    experimental evidence supports the identity of the immunopurified
                    iron-containing 78kDa Leishmania membrane-associated glycoprotein as human
                    transferrin.</p>
                <p>We also demonstrated the presence of high-affinity specific binding sites (Kd=2.2
                    10-8M) for transferrin on the We suggest that the 78kDa glycoprotein recognized
                    by mAb LD9 is transferrin (present in the culture medium) which binds to the
                    surface of Leishmania promastigotes via a transferrin receptor. It is also
                    suggested that transferrin requirement by Leishmania, related to its iron
                    transport function, may be exploited for chemotherapy of leishmaniasis.
                    Purification and biochemical characterization of transferrin receptor on

                    phospholipids and glycolipids are important as the components constructing cell
                    membranes. Glycosphingolipids are located on the outer surface of plasma
                    membranes and implicated in various cell surface-related functions such as cell
                    to cell recognition and cell differentiation; the components change with the
                    ontogenic and phylogenic development both in the vertebrates and invertebrates.
                    However, very little is known about glycolipids of Plathelminthes. This study
                    aims to characterize the glycosphingolipids of the tapeworm. Lipids were
                    extracted from the plerocercoid of the tapeworm. Total lipid content was 3.7% of
                    the whole body in wet weight: phospholipids and cholesterol accounted for 35%
                    and 19% of the total lipids, respectively. Major fatty acid composition of
                    cholesterol ester was found to be 16:0, 18:0, 18:1, 18:2 and 22:1. Glycolipids
                    were fractionated by DEAE-Sepharose column chromatography and then by silicic
                    acid column chromatography. All glycolipids were recovered in the neutral lipid
                    fraction. By thin-layer chromatography, four to five bands were detected in the
                    cerebroside region; and three migrated slightly faster than globoside. Gas
                    liquid chromatography analysis showed that galactose and glucose were contained
                    in cerebroside; fucose and hexosamine were also found in the more polar
                    glycolipids. The chemical structures of these glycolipids will be presented.</p>

                    spiralis muscle larvae in the induction of protective immune response and their
                    use in diagnosis of trichinellosis. It is our interest to study the molecular
                    organization and expression of the genes that encode for these surface
                    components. We have previously described the isolation of 3 clones from an
                    expression library of T. spiralis muscle larvae; these express T. spiralis
                    fusion peptides that share antigenic determinants with surface antigens of this
                    parasite. We have further characterized one of these clones (Ts-3) by
                    restriction enzyme analysis, Northern hybridization and DNA sequencing. DNA from
                    this clone has been isolated and digested with Eco R1 and two fragments were
                    obtained showing that the insert contains an internal Eco R1 recognition site.
                    The size of the fragments were determined to be 1,500 and 500 bp; both fragments
                    were purified from low melting point agar and used separately in Northern blot
                    analysis. Both restriction fragments hybridized to the same RNAs species with
                    sizes of 2, 1.7 and 1.3 Kb. At present we are sequencing the 1,500 bp fragment
                    by cloning this insert into Ml3mp8 followed by the dideoxy chain termination

                    MICROFILARICIDAL FACTORS It is postulated that melanization of some parasites in
                    susceptible host occured when certain components of the mosquito haemolymph
                    killed the invader and thus made them visible to the mosquito defence system. In
                    the present study, it was demostrated that Armigeres subalbatus released
                    microfilaricidal factors in response to a Brugia pahangi infection. The factors
                    were non-specific; both B. pahangi and B. malayi microfilariae were killed in
                    haemolymph obtained from mosquitoes infected with B. pahangi. Maximum
                    microfilaricidal activity was observed in the haemolymph from mosquitoes with a
                    24 hour old B. pahangi infection.</p>
                <p>Haemagglutinins were also detected together with microfilaricidal factors.</p>
                <p>Maximum haemagglutination activity was seen at 24 hours post infection (p.i.),
                    followed by day 6 p.i; it corresponds with the presence of microfilariae in the
                    haemocoel and stage-2 larvae moulting into stage-3 respectively. The
                    häemaggiutinins in Ar. subalbatus were shown to be lectins. Sugar imhibition

                    Palmer Gainesville, FL 32610, USA Anaplasma marginale, vaccine, genes Anaplasma
                    marginale is a tick-borne rickettsial parasite severely constraining cattle
                    production world-wide. Cattle can be protected against homologous and
                    heterologous challenge by immunization with the A. marginale surface protein
                    MSP-1 isolated from infected erythrocytes. This protein consists of two
                    polypeptides of similar molecular weight in an isolate from Florida (apparent
                    molecular weights on electrophoresis of 100,000 and 105,000). In other parasite
                    isolates the 105,000 polypeptide exhibits dramatic size variations of up to 50%,
                    but consistently bears an epitope defined by monoclonal antibody 22B1. This
                    antibody neutralizes the infectivity of parasites for cattle. To understand the
                    basis for these observations and develop a recombinant or synthetic vaccine we
                    have cloned and sequenced the genes for both polypeptides. Major observations
                    from these analyses are: 1) the 105,000 and 100,000 polypeptides both contain
                    domains of tandemly repeated peptides. In the 105,000 polypeptide these are
                    either 28 or 29 amino acids in length and vary in number from 8 to 2 in the 4
                    different isolates tested. These differences, taken together with anomalous
                    migration on SDS gels, completely account for the size polymorphisms.
                    Neutralizing monoclonal antibody 22B1 recognizes a minimal epitope of 6 amino
                    acids within these repeats. In the 100,000 polypeptide there is a 7 amino acid
                    peptide in the Florida isolate, repeated 4 times with minor modifications. The
                    structure of this domain in other isolates is not yet known. 2) Both genes use
                    promoter structures similar to the consensus E. coli sequence. 3) The N- and
                    C-termini of the 100,000 polypeptide are Gln-rich and contain unusual runs of
                    this amino acid.</p>
                <p>Availability of these sequences and definition of a conserved
                    neutralization-sensitive epitope allow several alternative possibilities for
                    vaccine development.</p>

                <p>Two stages of Toxoplasma gondii are found in the mammalian host; the prolific
                    tachyzoite responsible for dissemination of tne infection and the Mdormant''
                    tissue cyst containing bradyzoites which persist for the lifespan of the host.
                    The functional differences between these forms are echoed in the metabolic
                    profile of the parasites.</p>
                <p>We are currently mapping the proteins expressed by cysts and tachyzoites via
                    2D-SDS-PAGE combined with imnunoblotting. Studies using monoclonal antibodies
                    and polyspecific sera have shown that a number of immunogenic molecules of low
                    molecular weight are present in both forms (45, 35, 27 &amp; 23kDA). Other
                    proteins such as tne P30 tachyzoite surface antigen exhibit stage specific
                    expression. Abundance of non-immunogenic proteins also varies, for example,
                    tachyzoites show high expression of an acidic 28kDa protein.</p>

                    antisense oligodeoxynucleotides to artificially regulate the expression of a
                    target gene. Two different types of modifications have been introduced into the
                    antisense molecule: i) œ-anomers have been used instead of natural B-anomers,
                    leading to oligomers fully resistant to DNases, ii) an alkylating agent,
                    [4(N-2-chloroethyl-N- methyl)amino-benzyl]methylamine, was covalently linked at
                    the 5' end of the oligomer. We targetted such modified oligonucleotides either
                    to the rabbit B-globin gene or to the mini-exon sequence present at the 5’ end
                    of all mRNA from Trypanosoma brucei (T.b.). An @&amp;-17-mer, complementary to
                    the coding region of the rabbit B-globin gene, had no effect on protein
                    synthesis in cell-free extracts. This was ascribed to the fact that
                    œ&amp;-oligomers did not elicit RNase- H activity. In both cases (globin and T.
                    b. mRNAs) we detected a specific cross-linked product between the target RNA and
                    a complementary alkylating antisense oligomer (no cross-linking was observed
                    with non-complementary sequences). The effects of such modified oligonucleotides

                    These monoclonal antibodies were used to screen a pannel of genomic expression

                <p>Trypanosoma cruzi - mRNA capping - trans-splicing - SL-RNA - U-RNA Messenger RNA
                    in kinetoplastid protozoa undergoes a unique trans-splicing process of
                    maturation in which a 39 nucleotide (nt) spliced leader (SL) from a small pri-
                    mary transcript (SL-RNA) is ligated to the 5' termini of the mature mRNAs. The
                    5' cap from the SL-RNA becomes the cap on the mature mRNA. Thus, the only RNAs
                    that need be capped in these organisms are the SL-RNA and the U-RNAs. We have
                    begun to examine the biochemical mechanisms of mRNA maturation in nuclear ex-
                    tracts from T. cruzi. We have found that when these extracts are incubated in
                    the presence of [a-®P]GTP and ATP, several small RNAs are labelled. Analysis of
                    nuclease digestion products of these labelled RNAs by thin layer chromato-
                    graphy showed that the labelling was due to 5’ capping of these RNAs. Sequence
                    analysis identified three of these RNAs as the T. cruzi SL-RNA, U2-RNA and an
                    unassigned U-RNA (Ux). In contrast to other known soluble capping reactions,
                    capping in the T. cruzi extract is ATP dependent and shows specificity; i.e.,
                    only the SL- and U-RNAs are capped. We have fractionated the capping activity in
                    glycerol gradients and by large pore gel filtration chromatography. Prelimi-
                    nary results suggest that the capping activity fractionates as a -20S particle
                    containing the small RNAs to be capped. In conclusion, we have observed an RNA
                    capping activity in T. cruzi nuclear extracts with specificity reflecting the in
                    vivo requirements for capping in the kinetoplastid protozoa, and we have shown
                    that this activity fractionates as a small ribonucleoprotein particle.</p>

                    Bionmedicina,ïacultad de Medicina,Universidad Central,vVnzla We have previously
                    detected various enzymatic activities in Paracoccidioides brasiliensis. We now
                    studied Adenosine Triphosphatase ( ATPase ) activity in yeast phase cultures of
                    P. brasiliensis of in- creasing age. We employed Wachstein and Meisel”s method
                    and electron microscopy. Specific electron-dense deposits indicating ATPase
                    activ- ity were present in the cytoplasnm around vacuoles. Their distribution
                    varied according to age. Deposits decreased or became absent in old
                    cultures.</p>
                <p>We assume that in P. brasiliensis, ATPase is involved ( as in other systens) with
                    transport of Nat and K+.</p>

                <p>T.gondii, Secreted antigens; Ultrastructural localization Since we have
                    previously demonstrated the protective role played by Toxoplasma
                    excreted-secreted antigens (Darcy et al., 1988, Parasite Immunol., 10, 553), the
                    aim of the present work was an attempt to precise the location of these antigens
                    in the tachyzoite and the bradyzoite stages, in order to explore the mechanisms
                    of secretion of 7. gondii.</p>
                <p>We have produced three monoclonal antibodies directed against excreted-secreted
                    antigens of 21, 27 and 28.5 kDa. Colloidal immunogold labelling showed their
                    ultrastructural localization in the matrix of the dense granules of tachyzoites
                    and bradyzoites. They were moreover found in the parasitophorous vacuole after
                    host cell invasion and in the cyst ground substance. These observations suggest
                    the following mechanism of Toxoplasma secretion: secreted antigens are first
                    stored in tachyzoite and bradyzoite dense granules, and then released inside the
                    parasitophorous vacuole and the cystic matrix.</p>
                <p>Among the secretory molecules characterized here, the native 27 kDa antigen is a
                    calcium-binding protein found to be intermixed with the 21 and 28.5 kDa antigens
                    inside the dense granules, and hence could play a role in the packaging of
                    secretory products. The 21 and 28.5 kDa antigens were also located beneath the
                    parasite plasmalemma, that could reflect a transient step characteristic of
                    T.gondii secretion. Finally, the 28.5 kDa antigen was found preferentially
                    associated with the-ground substance of the cyst wall and the microvilli network
                    of the parasitophorous vacuole whereas the 21 kDa antigen was associated with
                    the delimiting membrane of both the cyst wall and the parasitophorous
                    vacuole.</p>

                    the United States of this protozoal parasite infecting a dog which had not
                    traveled overseas (Science 1979, 204:1431-1432). Since 1988 numerous indigenous
                    Californian dogs have been diagnosed with B. qgibsoni infections by our
                    laboratory. Babesia gibsoni has been isolated from naturally infected dogs in
                    California and the course of disease has been studied in experimentally infected
                    dogs.</p>
                <p>An indirect fluorescent antibody test was developed and used to evaluate the
                    immunological response of naturally and experimentally infected dogs to B.
                    gibsoni. The objectives of this study were 1) to investigate the antigenic
                    differences between B. gqibsoni and other endemic babesial parasites and 2) to
                    identify B. gqibsoni-specific antigens that can be used in the development of an
                    improved enzyme-linked immunoabsorbent assay for this parasite. Immunoblot
                    analyses have been performed using lysates of B. gibsoni and B. canis from dogs
                    and different isolates of B. microti which were taken from infected Peromyscus
                    mice and humans in the United States. In addition, piroplasm DNA was prepared
                    and compared by restriction enzyme analysis, as part of our initial studies to
                    better characterize these parasites at the molecular level.</p>

                    inducing a protective immune re- sponse. We used a rabbit serum raised against
                    the N-terminal 14 amino acids of a 22 kD L. carinii sheath antigen to screen a
                    cDNA expression library of adult B. pahangi worms (provided by Dr M. Selkirk,

                    molecular weight (185-200 kDa) schizont-specific polymorphic glycoprotein of
                    Plasmodium falciparum, MSA-1, is processed to major fragments of 76,41 and 19
                    kDa found on the surface of merozoites. The nature of this processing was
                    studied by immunoblotting with monoclonal antibodies (MABs) and also by
                    comparison of the N-terminal protein sequences of the fragments with the protein
                    sequence deduced from the known complete DNA sequence. Mature schizont/merozoite
                    extracts were immunoblotted with a panel of MABS. Antigen MSA-1 was affinity
                    purified from parasite extracts using MAB 4H9/19 and eluted as a complex. The
                    eluted proteins were separated on a multiphasic zone electrophoresis system,
                    electrophoretically transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane and the
                    N-terminal amino acid sequences of the protein bands determined by gas phase
                    sequencing using an ABI 470 protein sequencer. The MABs immunoblotted two
                    distinct groups of proteins. Fragments of MSA-1 with molar masses of 175, 135
                    and 76 kDa were derived from the N-terminus of the protein following cleavage of
                    a signal peptide. Other fragments with molar masses of 48, 44 and 41 kDa gave
                    peptide sequences located at the C-terminus of the protein. A putative
                    processing scheme for MSA-1 based on immunoblotting with MABs and sequencing of
                    affinity purified fragments is as follows: Cleavage of a signal peptide from the
                    N-terminus followed by processing into a series of fragments gives rise to the
                    76 kDa protein, concomitant with processing from the C-terminus to give the 41
                    kDa protein, both found on the merozoite surface. The apparent proteolytic
                    cleavage sites near the C-terminus were conserved between isolates hence the
                    same protease may be responsible for this processing.</p>

                    cells.</p>
                <p>Although poorly known, schizont bursting seems to be an active phenomena,
                    involving enzyme activities. Protein P126 is proteolyzed at the time of
                    schizonts bursting into two fragments of 50 KD (P50) and 73 kD (P73) that are
                    released in the culture medium. P73 is made of two polypeptides of 47 kD (P47)
                    and 18 kD (P18) bound by disulfide bridges.</p>
                <p>P50 has been shown to be the processing product of a 56 KkD (P56) intermediate
                    that is proteolyzed by a cysteine protease which can be inhibited by leupeptin.
                    Nucleotide sequence of the gene coding for P126 and deduced aminoacid sequence
                    have been published by different authors. It was therefore interesting to map
                    the proteolytic fragments of the molecule on the precursor and to determine the
                    clivage sites in order to deduce informations on the proteolytic activities
                    involved in the processing of p126 and possibly on merozoite release. For this
                    purpose, using a combinaison of affinity purification on monoclonal antibodies,
                    gel electrophoresis and electroblotting, we have determined the N-terminal
                    amino-acid sequences of P126, P56, P50, P47 and P18 isolated from the culture
                    medium. These sequences were mapped on the deduced amino-acid sequence of P126.
                    This study showed that P50 and P56 have the same N-terminus and that the
                    leupeptin sensitive cleavage is in the C-terminal part of P56.</p>

                    High-mannose oligosaccharides are synthesized in the do- lichol cycle and

                    transfer of additional glycosyl units may follow. In contrast to mammalian and
                    some other protozoal systems, very little is known about glycoproteins and
                    glycosylation reactions in P.falciparum.</p>

                <p>Having seen that P.falciparum does synthesize glycoproteins, a number of specific
                    inhibitors affecting different steps of the dolichol cycle and of the trimming

                    intraerythrocytic P.falciparum. Inhibitors of the dolichol pathway inhibited
                    growth, suggesting the involvement of this metabolic route in malaria parasite
                    growth. Parasite growth was most susceptible immediately prior to onset of
                    segmentation. Trimming inhibitors examined so far did not impair growth of
                    P.falciparum, suggesting that oligo- saccharide processing may not be of great
                    importance for parasite survi- val. - A cell-free system for the study of

                <p>The excreted or secreted products of parasitic helminths are of interest to a
                    number of laboratories studying the basic biology of helminths, their
                    interaction with host animals and their potential use as anti-parasite vaccines.
                    Using the guinea pig as a laboratory model, protective immunity against
                    infection by T.colubriformis can be induced by immunization with
                    excretory/secretory (ES) antigens from either the L4 stage or mature adult
                    worms. ES products were obtained by overnight culture and affinity
                    chromatography on a lentil lectin-Sepharose 4B column. Whole ESA, the lectin
                    bound (LL+) and unbound (LL-) fractions, and purified major components, are all
                    protective when used to vaccinate guinea pigs, the protection ranging from 50%
                    to greater than 90%.</p>
                <p>Limited amino acid sequence data have been obtained for five adult ES antigens
                    and three of these, one from the LL+ fraction (ESAl), and two from the LL-
                    fraction (ESA3 and ESA4), have been cloned and sequenced. ESAIl, the major
                    component of ESA, has a molecular weight of 15,000 based on the cDNA sequence,
                    and is glycosylated although the carbohydrate is not essential for protection.
                    It has a cleaved signal sequence and four potential N-glycosylation sites. There

                    Enzyme Adult Japanese Fasciola sp., whose proper scientific name has been de-
                    bated were examined for some proteases. Enzymes were extracted with deion- ized
                    water from the homogenate of the parasites collected from the bile duct of
                    naturally infected cattle, and the extract was then applied to gel filtration
                    with a Cellulofine GCL-300-m column. In the resultant chromato- gram,
                    L-leucine-p-nitroanilide (Leu-pNA) amidolytic activity was clearly detected in
                    two peaks, the first one with very low activity and the second with high
                    activity, although N-0-benzoyl-DL-arginine-p-nitroanilide, glut-
                    aryl-L-phenylalanine-p-nitroanilide, and succinyl-L-alanyl-L-alanyl-L-ala-
                    nine-p-nitroanilide amidolytic activities were all very low. The second Leu-pNA
                    amidolytic enzyme above mentioned had a molecular weight of 2.5 x 10* daltons
                    estimated by gel filtration and showed the optimum pH of 7.0 - 7.5. This enzyme
                    seemed to be a metal ptotease because its activity was inhibited by EDTA, EGTA,
                    and o-phenanthroline. Similar Leu-pNA amidolytic enzymes were also detected in
                    an additional experiment from the cestode Dipylidium caninum and the nematode
                    Dirofilaria immitis, and the enzyme of D. immitis resembled the Fasciola's one
                    in molecular weight, optimum pH, and inhibitors. Accordingly, Leu-pNA amidolytic
                    enzymes seem to be widely distributed in parasitic helminths and the enzymes of
                    some species, re- gardless of their taxonomic situations, have almost the same
                    properties.</p>

                <p>Trichostrongyle, Haemonchus, Ecdysis, Cuticle Infective third stage
                    trichostrongyle larvae retain the second molt (2M) cuticle as free-living larvae
                    on pasture. Upon ingestion of infective larvae by a ruminant host, ecdysis of
                    the 2M cuticle occurs. We have purified and characterized a 44 kDa
                    zinc-metalloprotease from Haemonchus contortus and shown that this enzyme
                    mediates this ecdysis. The action of this protease results in the enzymatic
                    degradation of a specialized region of the second molt cuticle, approximately 20
                    um from the anterior end. We have shown that this region of the 2M cuticle
                    contains a biochemically unique polypeptide with a Mr of 160 kDa. The 160 KkDa
                    polypeptide and related polypeptides (120 and 105 KkDa) are synthesized in the
                    2M cuticle at approximately six days of free-living larval development. Isolated
                    160 KkDa polypeptide is degraded in the presence of purified 44 KkDa enzyme.
                    Polypeptides, structurally similar to the 160 kDa polypeptide from H. contortus,
                    occur in other ruminant trichostrongyles suggesting conservation of this
                    substrate region.</p>
                <p>Cuticle polypeptides digested during ecdysis differ from protease insensitive
                    second molt cuticle collagens in amino acid composition and collagenase
                    sensitivity. However, some antigenic homologies do exist between the 160 KDa
                    polypeptide and the cuticle collagens suggesting structurally similar regions.
                    These collagen-like regions of the 160 kDa substrate polypeptide might serve to
                    anchor these polypeptides in the cuticle until digestion by parasite protease
                    causes their release.</p>

                <p>Trypanosomes - Transcription - RNA-Polymerases We have characterized the RNA
                    polymerases (Pol's) of Trypanosoma brucei at the biochemical and at the
                    genetical level. We could demonstrate that T.brucei contains the classical set
                    of Pol I, II and III (1-4). The presence of an additional gene encoding a second
                    copy of the largest subunit of Pol II supports the observation that the surface
                    antigen genes are transcribed by an amanitin-resistant Pol II in in vitro
                    transcription assays using isolated nuclei (run-ons) (4). The biochemical
                    characterization of the trypanosomal Pol I-III was confirmed by a specific
                    recognition of the Pol fractions by gene-specific antibodies. We were, however,
                    unable to identify an amanitin-resistant Pol II by chromatography. We also
                    obtained preliminary data from run-on experiments, suggesting that pol III might
                    transcribe the mini-exon genes, which encode the 5' end of each trypanosomal
                    mRNA. Since it has been demonstrated that the La-protein is involved in
                    transcription termination of class III genes, we used a monoclonal anti-La
                    antibody to immunoprecipitate trypanosomal RNAs. With this monoclonal antibody
                    we could immunoprecipitate TtRNAs, 5S RNA and medRNA as a primary transcription
                    complex together with Pol III. These last results, which will be presented,
                    provide strong support for the hypothesis that the mini-exon genes are
                    transcribed by Pol III.</p>

                <p>Cell Cycle, T. Brucei, DNA synthesis We have described a quantitative, linear map
                    of the T. brucei cell cycle in terms of nuclear and kKinetoplast division phases
                    and flagellum elongation. We have also used immunof luorescence detection of
                    5-bromo-2-deoxyuridine substituted DNA to determine the timing of initiation and
                    duration of nuclear and kinetoplast S-phases. Both are periodic having a
                    calculated duration of 0.18 and 0.12 of the cell cycle respectively. In addition
                    initiation of both S-phases were in approximate synchrony, differing by only
                    0.03 of the cell cycle. We have also used a monoclonal antibody which recognises
                    the basal body of T. brucei in order to determine the time of probasal body
                    formation within the cell cycle. Probasal body formation was found to occur
                    within a few minutes of initiation of nuclear S-phase, at 0.41 of the unit cell
                    cycle. This provides detection of the earliest known cell cycle events at the
                    level of the light microscope. Cell cycle events including initiation of nuclear
                    and kinetoplast DNA replication and probasal body formation may be strictly
                    coordinated in T. brucei in order to maintain the precise single kinetoplast,

                    predicted amino acid sequence of Sm20 shows significant homology with the family
                    of calcium binding proteins which include calmodulin, troponin C and the
                    regulatory light chain of myosin. However, no immunological cross- reactivity
                    could be demonstrated between Sm20 and calmodulins from a range of other
                    species. The fusion protein of Sm20 was able to bind a radioactive isotope of
                    calcium showing that it is a functional calcium binding protein. This antigen is
                    expressed in all life cycle stages except eggs, the majority being localised in
                    the muscle layers.</p>

                    between isolates, even within the same zymodeme. Further studies are required to
                    determine if antigenic epi- topes are altered during the growth and cell
                    division cycles of Giardia and whether a possible link between virulence and the

                    protein In Schistosoma japonicum adult worms, a female-specific protein which
                    has approxi- 4 mately 34 kDa in molecular weight was prominently labelled with L
                    C-tyrosine by the pulse incorporation in vitro. This female-specific protein was
                    clearly demonstrated to localize exclusively in the vitelline cells by
                    immunofluorescence using the rabbit anti-34kDa protein antiserum. However, this
                    protein could not be found in the extract of newly-laid eggs by immunoblots
                    using the same antiserum. These results may indicate the occurrence of
                    cross-1inking in an eggshell precursor protein, namely tyrosine-rich 34 kDa
                    protein, during eggshell hardening, though some other possibilities can not be
                    excluded. This idea is supported by the following facts that 1) the pulse
                    labelled autoradiograph showed that VC _tyrosine was selectively incorporated
                    into vitelline cells. 2) The newly-formed eggshell become heavily labelled in
                    chase medium within two days of cultivation. 3) Consequently, the prominent band

                    subunit(Ip) deduced from cDNA was highly homologous with those of bovine heart

                    three cysteine-rich clusters, which may be the binding site for iron- sulfur

                <p>P.falciparum, differential splicing, genomic structure On screening a DNA library
                    from P.falciparum genomic DNA with an antiserum against the 41 kDa protein band,
                    which confers protective immunity to monkeys (1), a weakly reacting clone (41-3)
                    was isolated. The 41-3 insert was used to identify a genomic fragment of 3.15 kb
                    by screening of a genomic DNA library prepared using mung bean nuclease. This
                    fragment reveals only short open reading frames. To determine its exon-intron
                    pattern cDNA was prepared and amplified by the polymerase chain reaction using
                    different specific obligonnucleotides. These isolated cDNA fragments cover 1.9
                    kb of the S’end of the genomic clone and reveal a complex genomic structure of
                    the 41-3 gene. So far, seven short exons and six intervening sequences have been
                    determined.</p>
                <p>The isolation of three distinct but related cDNAs from this gene, which share
                    common sequences at their 5° and 3’ ends, demonstrates that small exons are
                    differentially spliced in an intricate combinational pattern to generate at
                    least three distinct mRNAs encoding different isoforms of a P.falciparum blood
                    stage antigen. Additionally it was shown that the gene seems to have two start
                    codons which would increase the number of different splice products. mRNA
                    expressed from this gene ranges from 1.3 to 2.5 kb as shown by Northern blot
                    analysis. Anti- sera raised against one of the E.coli expressed splice products
                    of the gene recog- nize a 41kDa antigen localized mainly within the
                    parasitophorous vacuole as demon- strated by Western blot analysis and

                    Naegleria-thermotolerance Heat-shock proteins (HSPs) have been found in all
                    prokaryote and eukaryote cells examined. The purpose of this study was to
                    ascertain the presence of HSPs in Naegleria species. N. fowleri (thermotolerant
                    and pathogenic) and N. gruberi (thermosensitive and non-pathogenic) were
                    observed for HSP synthesis and comparisons made. Cells (10° per treatment) were
                    heat-shocked, labeled with [35$]-L-methionine for 40 min, washed and processed
                    for polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and autoradiography.</p>
                <p>The possible association between HSPs synthesis and thermotolerance was studied
                    by pretreating cells with an elevated, sublethal temperature. Cells were then
                    heat-shocked and number of surviving cells quantitated post treatment. HSPs in
                    the 70 kDa family were produced in both N. gruberi and N. fowleri. Pretreatment
                    caused an increase in both protein synthesis and survival. We conclude that HSPs
                    and thermotolerance are associated. (Supported by NIH Grant AI-28041) 80 S 1.E -

                    kD. Hydrogenase is part of the metabolic pathway of pyruvate conversion to
                    acetyl- CoA and is responsible for the reoxidation of ferredoxin coupled with
                    removal of reducing equivalents as H,. Antiserum prepared against purified T.

                    foetus genomic DNA. Thirteen clones were obtained and they have been partiaïkly
                    characterized. Western blot analysis of these clones using hydrogenase antiserum
                    revealed six different clones, two producing beta-galactosidase fusion proteins
                    of 200 and 128 kD. Monospecific antiserum to these fusion proteins, eluted from
                    Western blots, showed immunoreactivity on Western blots of purified
                    hydrogenosomes with the 58 kD polypeptide. The DNA inserts from five of the six
                    different clones have been isolated. The clone producing the 200 kD fusion
                    protein has an insert size of 1.25 kbp. The four clones, which do not produce
                    fusion proteins, have inserts of 1.49, 1.75, 2.95, and 3.30 kbp. Supported by

                <p>Translation regulation - Gene expression A series of unmodified
                    oligodeoxynucleotides (termed AMEXOs = Anti-Mini-EXon Oligonucleotides) have
                    been targetted to the mini-exon sequence present at the 5' end of all mRNA from
                    Trypanosoma brucei (T.b.) or Leishmania mexicana (L.m.). On the one hand we
                    investigated the affinity of AMEXOSs for complementary and non complementary RNA
                    by thermal elution of filter-bound complexes. On the other hand we investigated
                    the effect of these AMEXOSs on protein synthesis in cell free extracts

                    However, a 12-mer oligonucleotide displayed unexpected antisense properties.
                    This was ascribed to the high sensitivity of the oligonucleotide/mRNA hybrid to
                    RNase-H: such an effect was not observed in the presence of homologous modified
                    oligonucleotides that do not induce RNA cleavage or in cell-free extracts devoid
                    of RNase-H activity.</p>

                <p>Promastigotes of Leishmania donovania constitutively secrete a soluble acid
                    phosphatase activity (S-ACP). This enzyme is also released by amastigotes within
                    infected macrophages in vitro. It has been suggested that S-ACP may play a role
                    in protecting both developmental forms within their respective hydrolytic
                    environments.</p>
                <p>Therefore, it was of interest to determine whether various protease treatments
                    had any effect on S-ACP.</p>
                <p>Culture supernatants from mid-log phase promastigotes grown in chemically defined
                    medium were used as a source of S-ACP activity. These were treated with a
                    variety of endo- and exoproteases. The activities of these proteases were
                    confirmed using azocasein.</p>
                <p>Dispase, elastase, pronase, subtilisin and tr sin, even at concentrations up to
                    1000 xg ml -1, had no apparent effect on the enzymatic activity of S-ACP. In
                    contrast, chymotrypsin, ficin, papain, SVB protease and thermolysin actually
                    increased activity.</p>
                <p>Only bromelaïin had anydeleterious effect on S-ACP activity. Results of SDS-PAGE
                    autoradiography showed that all of these proteases apparently degraded
                    metabolically labeled S-ACP. Preliminary experiments in which protease treated
                    S-ACP was resolved on non-reducing, native arcylamide gels and then stained for
                    acid phosphatase activity gave similar results. All the proteases, apart from
                    dispase and trypsin, degraded S-ACP.</p>
                <p>The cumulative results demonstrate that although the S-ACP molecule is hydrolyzed
                    by most of these proteases, active-site remains fully functional. The property
                    could be of importance in parasite survival.</p>

                <p>In the study of the development of the larval stage of E.granulosus (i.e. the
                    step of asexual reproduction by vhich the germinal layer of the hydatid cyst
                    gives the protoscoleces) and the mlecular bases of the parasite- host
                    adaptation, several approaches have been undertaken: Search of a) genes
                    differentially expressed in the germinal layer and in protoscoleces; b) genes
                    involved in developmental processes; c) host-parasite mediator molecules
                    involved in the adaptative process; and the study of d) the organization of the
                    parasite's genome. À genomic library of E. granulosus has been constructed in À
                    EMGL3 (1x10$ recombinants, inserts of 15-20 kb), and a cDNA library from
                    protoscolex mRNA has been constructed in Agt1l (5,5 x 105 recombinants, inserts
                    of 2500- 500 bp, as measured by PCR). Looking for differentiation markers,
                    several cytoskeletal protein genes have been primarily characterized by
                    Southern, Western and immmocytochemical procedures (el-tubulin, myosin,
                    actin).</p>
                <p>Concerning genes involved in development, three different kinds of putative
                    homobox containing clones have been isolated from the genomic library with a
                    synthetic consensus oligonucleotide. In relation to mdiator mle- cules, and from
                    the data previously reported for other platyhelminths, the search of peptidic
                    hormore-like pro- ducts has been done with human growth hormone and human
                    insuline nrobes. Positive bands have been obtained in Southern blots with both
                    probes. Finally, several clones bearing highly repetitive sequences have been
                    isola- ted from the genomic library, and one of them was subcloned and
                    analyzed.</p>
                <p>From our starting work we think that the knowledge of E. granulosus development
                    can contribute to the under- standing of the process of the parasitic adaptation
                    to the specific hosts.</p>

                    des trypomastigotes infectants; leur forte détection par immunofluorescence au

                    host immune response A cDNA encoding the carboxyl-terminal of the specific 12kDa
                    antigen (sub-unit of antigen B) of the hydatid disease organism, Echinococcus
                    granulosus, has been cloned and sequenced. In addition, amino-acid sequence has
                    been generated for the amino- terminal which is tentatively contiguous with the
                    open reading frame of the DNA- derived sequence. Comparison of the inferred
                    sequence of the 12kDa antigen with other known sequences indicated a limited
                    similarity to a-1 antitrypsin. In functional assays, gel-purified native 12kDa
                    antigen from natural infections inhibited elastase but not trypsin or
                    chymotrypsin, providing further evidence that this antigen is a parasite
                    protease inhibitor. Possibly unrelated to its anti- protease activity but a
                    potentially important function of the 12kDa antigen was its ability to inhibit
                    recruitment of neutrophils. These functions may be important to the viability of
                    the parasite in the face of the host immune response. In addition, the match
                    between the DNA-derived sequence and the protein sequence was imperfect, with
                    some residues having, according to the amino acid sequencing, two alternatives
                    in approximately equal concentrations, and four DNA-derived residues failing to
                    match with the protein sequence at all. The 12kDa may be expressed as isoforms
                    from a polymorphic gene and, as far as we are aware, this observed sequence
                    diversity has not, to date, been described for any other helminth antigen.</p>

                <p>This recombinant has been expressed as a f-galactosidase fusion protein and used
                    to raïse antisera, Immunofluorescent staining studies with this sera have shown
                    that the antigen is expressed in the tegument of the juvenile fluke and in the
                    reproductive system of the adult. Immunoblotting carried out on homogenates of
                    F. hepatica has shown that the differential expression seen in IFA is paralleled
                    by changes in the molecular weight of the antigen. Dideoxy nucleotide sequencing
                    has shown that the insert contains a repeat sequence conserved at both the
                    amino-acid and nucleotide levels, This suggests that F. hepatica may produce
                    decoy proteins during its migratory stage in the definitive host.</p>

                <p>Schistosoma mansoni, nucleotide sequence, FABP-homologue, Myelin P2- homologue
                    The complete nucleotide sequence encoding a Schistosoma mansoni protein Sml4 was
                    cloned in Escherichia coli. The 14.8K protein bears significant homologies with
                    a family of related polypeptides, which bind hydrophobic ligands. Members of
                    this group of proteins include fatty acid binding proteins and P2 protein of
                    peripheral nerve myelin. À comparison of the deduced amino acid sequence of Sml4
                    with lipid binding proteins reveals a high degree of homology at their
                    N-terminal regions. Conserved N- terminal structures may be a common feature of
                    these proteins, with regard to ligand binding or interaction with membrane
                    lipids. Using antibodies raised to MS2 polymerase fusion protein in
                    immunofluorescence experiments, Sml4 was identified on the tegumental membrane
                    of the adult schistosome. The antiserum does not cross react with the P2 protein
                    of murine peripheral nerve myelin. This, together with the fact that the
                    schistosome does not contain myelin would support the concept that the protein
                    is not associated with the nervous system. From these data, and the knowledge
                    that the schistosome is unable to synthesise its own lipids, it seems reasonable
                    to suggest that Sml4 is involved in a basic cellular function, like lipid
                    uptake.</p>

                    glutathione-S-transferase Glutathione-S-transferases (GST) are a group of
                    multifunctional proteins involved in the detoxification of toxic compounds such
                    as lipid hydroperoxides. The GSTs of Fasciola hepatica (liver fluke) have been
                    shown to significantly protect sheep against fascioliasis. As a step towards the
                    development of a recombinant GST vaccine, we have cloned cDNAS encoding GSTs of
                    F. hepatica. Expression cDNA libraries in gt11 and ZAP were screened with rabbit
                    antiserum raised against the native GSTs of F. hepatica. One cDNA clone (GST1)
                    was obtained. DNA sequencing of GST1 insert DNA revealed an open reading frame
                    encoding a polypeptide which was 52-56% homologous to the Schistosoma Mr 26,000
                    GSTs. To obtain CDNA clones encoding other GSTs, the GST1 fusion protein was
                    expressed and used to deplete the rabbit anti-GST antiserum of GST1
                    specificities.</p>
                <p>On using this depleted antiserum to rescreen the expression libraries another GST
                    cDNA clone (GST7) was identified which had 68% homology to GST1. GST7 insert DNA
                    was used to rescreen the expression libraries to isolate clones GST42, GST47 and
                    GST50 which showed significant homology (76-87%) but were not identical to GST7.
                    The F. hepatica GST cDNAs are 48-59% identical to the Schistosoma 26 KkD GSTs.
                    Antisera from sheep vaccinated with native GSTs recognise polypeptides expressed
                    from the GST1 and GST7 cDNAs. These results show that adult F.hepatica expresses
                    at least five GST genes, a diversity unparalleled thus far in other species.</p>

                    amastigotes of Leishmania differ in their antigenic and enzymatic
                    properties.</p>
                <p>Some of these changes are induced by the shift in temperature caused by
                    transmission from the invertebrate to the vertebrate host. Such temperature
                    shifts are an integral part of Leishmania life cycle, and play a major role in
                    stage transformation of these parasites. When Leishmania mexicana amazonensis
                    promastigotes are exposed to an increase in temperature, the synthesis of small
                    molecular weight proteins is induced, in addition to the major conserved 70 and
                    83 kD hsps. Analysis on 2-D gels of protein cell extracts metabolically labeled
                    with %H-leucine at 35°C as compared to 26°C reveals increased synthesis of a
                    group of small proteins with molecular weights ranging from 14 to 30 kD, most
                    prominent being a protein of 22 KD.</p>
                <p>Antibodies raised against this heat induced protein excised from 2-D gels, were
                    used to determine the subcellular distribution of this protein, using
                    immuno-gold labeling of electron microscopical cryosections. The 22 kD protein
                    was found in the mitrochondrion of the parasite, at all life stages. This

                    as the characterization of this protein, in the CAMP strain of P. falciparum.A

                    from a P.</p>
                <p>falciparum CAMP strain genomic DNA library. Overlapping restriction enzyme
                    fragments have been c'oned and sequenced. The open reading frame contains 2
                    different repeat regions. One of them includes a Glu-Glu dipeptide as has been
                    reported for some other malaria! proteins. Comparison of the nucleotide and
                    deduced amino-acid sequence with various sequence databases shows no overall
                    homology with other reported sequences. Peptides corresponding to repeat and
                    non-repeat regions have been synthesized. Sera from rabbiîts immunized with
                    these peptides have been used to characterize p230. Indirect immunofluorescence
                    performed on fixed parasitized erythrocytes suggests an association of the
                    antigen with the parasitophorous vacuole. Immunoprecipitation of metabolically
                    labeled synchronized parasites antigens at different times in the
                    intraerythrocytic cycle indicates that p230 is synthesized during the
                    schizogony. Preliminary studies in different strains of P. falciparum show that
                    p230 demonstrates some straiîn-specific polymorphism.</p>

                    a wide range of molecular weights were obtained (14.0 -$ 66.0 kDa).A major

                    VARIATION, ISOENZYME, MONOCLONALS PURPOSE OF STUDY: As a prelude to a larger
                    study on the genetics of P.falciparum strains found in Zambia, infected blood
                    was collected, randomly, from five adult patients with a parasitaemia of greater
                    than 800 parasites per 200 white blood cells as determined in thick Giemsa
                    stained smears. The objective was to assess quickly: 1. the extent of genetic
                    variation in P.falciparum in order to ascertain whether a large survey was
                    justifiable. 2. whether this variation, if it existed, showed any particular
                    trend within a given area.</p>
                <p>METHODS: Two methods were used to determine genetic variation in P.falciparum
                    strains: 1. Immunofluorescent antibody tests using monoclonals against P190
                    (MSA-1 or PMMSA), GPH3-53 &amp; P23, using the full three slide test developed
                    by Edinburgh University.</p>
                <p>2. Isoenzyme typing using cellulose acetate electrophoresis and monitoring
                    GPI,PEP &amp; ADA RESULTS: Each of the five patients demonstrated a different
                    combination of monoclonal antibody reactions as well as isoenzyme types. In one
                    case a mixed infection was indicated.</p>
                <p>CONCLUSION: The sample size was too small for a comprehensive conclusion, but the
                    results clearly indicated the need for a substantial survey particularly as the
                    merozoite surface protein precursor (P190) is a promising vaccine candidate.
                    Objective (2) can only be fulfilled by a large scale survey, which is now in
                    progress.</p>

                <p>It possible that Mab 1E10 recognizes an epitope of the Pf155/RESA antigen, which
                    epitope is normally accessible only in gametocytes, but not in asexual parasites
                    unless they are denaturated and reduced. Alternatively, Mab 1E10 may
                    predominantly recognize gametocyte specific antigens which are related to
                    Pf155/RESA and cross- react with this protein in asexual parasites under

                    falciparum clone 3D7A has been screened with Mab 1E10. The screening gave 8
                    positive clones one of which has been fully sequenced. The fragment is 300 bp
                    long and represents an open reading frame coding for 100 amino acids; it has 73%

                    induces antigenic changes on the surface of human erythrocytes. These parasite
                    dependent new erythrocyte antigens are potentially important to induce partial
                    protective immunity. We present the cloning and sequencing of cDNA clones
                    specifc for blood stages of P. falciparum. A Xgtii cCDNA library was screened
                    for clones reacting positively with sera obtained from rabbits immunized with
                    membran fractions of erythrocytes infected with P. falciparum trophozoites or
                    schizonts. Positive cCDNA clones were further characterized with defined human
                    anti- P. falciparum sera from individuals from different endemic areas and from
                    patients with a primary P. falciparum infection. Clones positive with these sera
                    were analysed by sequencing. The predicted amino acid sequences of seven
                    antigens contained 30-50% Asparagin residues. The Asparagin rich antigen 18C1
                    reacted strongly with all human sera tested. As can be seen from the predicted
                    sequence, the 18C1 antigen codes for 1258 amino acids and could be devided into
                    regions with inconspicuous amino acid composition and regions with more than 70%
                    of Asparagin residues. These regions were subcloned using the PCR method to
                    localize the dominant epitopes of the 18C1 antigen. Like many other known P.
                    falciparum antigens, 18C1 contains a tandemly repeated sequence. To isolate
                    recombinant Asparagin rich antigens, we constructed a plasmid pHIS8, that allows
                    the expression of the water insoluble Asparagin rich antigens as poly Histidin
                    fusion proteins in Escherichia coli. These fusion proteins were purified in 6M
                    guanindin using metal chelate chromatography, to make them available for
                    immunodiagnostics and for vaccination trials.</p>

                <p>Trypanosomatid stress-related proteins The genome of Leishmania major contains
                    several dispersed genes that show sequence homology to the tandemly-repeated
                    heat shock protein 70 genes of trypanosomatids (Searle et al, Nucl. Acid. Res.
                    17, 5081). The genes Lm hsp70.1 and Lm hsp70.4 are not heat inducible but are
                    constitutively expressed during the promastigote stage of the parasite life
                    cycle. They are found throughout the genus Leishmania. The predicted open
                    reading frame of Lm hsp70.1 possesses an N terminal leader sequence of 23 amino
                    acids that bears the features of a mitochondrial signal sequence. No comparable
                    sequence is present in the Lm hsp70.4 gene, which presumably has a cytoplasmic
                    location. In order to determine the location and function of these different
                    stress-related proteins within the cell, each gene has been expressed as a
                    C-terminal fusion protein with the glutathione-S-transferase of Schistosoma
                    japonicum. The antibodies raised against these fusion proteins recognise
                    Leishmania promastigote proteins of 70 and 71 kD on Western blots and are now
                    being used in immunochemical and biochemical studies, to characterise the native
                    parasite proteins and to determine their intracellular locations.</p>

                    and cDNA library in expressing phage À gt II were created as the basis for
                    molecular approach in diagnosticums. cDNA library was screened by antibodies of
                    a man in- fected with E.granulosus with use of avidin-biotin system. Three
                    clones Ech-0.4, Ech-I.8; Ech-2.8 giving positive reaction with antibodies were
                    selected and isolated. Hybridisation analysis with restriction fragments of
                    genome DNA of E.granulosus showed that clone insertions were represen- ted by
                    unique sequences of DNA. The sizes of cDNA insertions in the ob- tained clones
                    were O.4, I.8, 2.8 kb. Partly purified proteins coded by clone sequences were
                    used as antigenes in ELISA with blood sera taken from sick animals and people.
                    Protein of the clone Ech-0.4 was highly sensitive (to IO00%) but reacted with
                    sera from patients with ascarido- sis, trichinellosis and cysticercosis. Protein
                    of clone Ech-I.8 demon- strated weaker sensitiveness (70-807) but was not
                    specific. Protein of clone Ech-2.8 in reaction with human sera was sensitive
                    (90-I00%) and did not cause cross-reaction with alveococcosis but with sheep and
                    pig sera was less sensitive (70-907).</p>

                <p>Key words: Heat shock protein 83; Leishmania mexicana amazonensis.</p>
                <p>Changes in the environmental temperature regulate the differential expression of
                    genes during Leishmania stage transformation. Molecular analysis of the heat
                    shock proteins (HSPs) in these parasites is therefore of interest, as a model
                    for thermoregulation of gene expression. HSP83 is a highly abundant protein in
                    Leishmania amastigotes and promastigotes exposed to elevated temperatures.
                    Specific antibodies obtained by immunization against a synthetic peptide showed
                    that HSP83 is phosphorylated, and distributed in the cytoplasm of Leishmania
                    parasites. The gene for HSP83 from Leishmania mericana amazonensis is present in
                    multicopies arranged in tandem repeats of 4 kb units. Such a repeat unit was
                    cloned from a genomic library, and the nucleotide sequence of both the coding
                    and the intergenic regions was determined. The 5? boundary of the message which
                    combines with the 3’ end of the mini-exon was mapped 318 bp upstream to the
                    translational initiation codon ATG. A high degree of conservation (84%) was
                    observed between the coding sequence of HSP83 from Leishmania, and those of
                    Trypanosoma cruzi. Unlike the coding sequences, the intergenic region did not
                    bear any striking homology to similar published sequences from HSP83 of
                    trypanosomes, nor from HSP70 of Leishmania major. While conducting a search for
                    sequences that resemble eukaryote thermoregulated promoters, several regions
                    with dyad symmetry were detected, however, only one was partially homologous
                    with the consensus heat shock element (HSE), present upstream to all eukaryote
                    HSPs studied to date. The final proof whether this palyndrome indeed enhances
                    transcription at elevated temperatures will be obtained from future transfection
                    experiments.</p>

                    Trichinella spiralis, Fusion protein, Epitope selection An antigenic polypeptide
                    of T. spiralis-infective larvae has been studied at the gene level. T.
                    spiralis-infective larvae were cultured in methionine-free medium containing
                    S-methionine, and antigenic polypeptides in somatic extracts and ES products
                    were compared with those îin in vitro translation products of mRNA from
                    infective larvae.</p>
                <p>Then, the gene encoding an antigenic polypeptide of T. spiralis larvae was
                    studied using recombinant DNA technique. cDNA was ligated into phage, ÀAgtil DNA
                    and packaged in vitro. The phages were infected to E. coli and Agtll expression
                    library was constructed. cDNA clone encoding H6 kDa antigenic polypeptide was
                    selected by immuno- screening of the library and identified by the epitope
                    selection method. A clone containing nearly full-length of cDNA for 46 kDa
                    protein was isolated, Nucleotide sequence of the cDNA was determined by the
                    dideoxynucleotide chaïn termination method, The gene encoding 46 kDa antigenic
                    polypeptide was characterised by DNA and RNA blot analysis using the cDNA as a
                    probe, The gene was transcribed to mRNA with approximately 1,400 nucleotides and
                    translated to 46 kDa polypeptide. The antigenic polypeptide was demonstrated to
                    be excreted/secreted as a 46 kDa native antigen by the Western blot assay using
                    monoclonal antibody. The antigenic B-galactosidase-cDNA fusion protein
                    synthesized by bacteria had no cross-reactivity with other parasite-infected
                    sera.</p>

                <p>The major surface glycoprotein, gp63, has been demonstrated to be a potentially
                    important protein involved in parasite-macrophage interaction and a vaccine
                    candidate against leishmaniasis.</p>
                <p>The aim of our work was to clarify the discrepancies reported above. We have thus
                    extracted and purified gp63 from four species of Leishmania, including i 5 or,
                    L..tropica and L.m, amazonensis, Since gp63 is an amphiphilic membrane protein
                    it was extracted from promastigotes by phase separation in Triron X-114 and
                    purified by FPLC. The electrophoretic migration of the reduced purified gp63
                    from the strains used, varied from 60 to 68 kDa. The average content of gp63
                    purified from 101! parasites differed among the strains. Monoclonal antibody
                    LD27, raised against purified L. infantum gp63 and found to inhibit
                    promastigote-macrophage interaction, crossreacted with all purified gp63.
                    Finally, all purified gp63 exhibited protease activity at pH 8.5 using as
                    substrates 125 I-insulin 8 chain, azocasein and nonfat milk. However, their
                    optimum pH was substrate dependent. Using azocasein as substrate ail gp63 had an
                    optimal activity at alkaline pH whereas their activity was optimal at acidic pH,
                    when 125 I-insulin 8 chain was used as substrate.</p>
                <p>Our results suggest that the two different optima pH reported for gp63 may be
                    related to the different substrates used for their determination. Binding of the
                    substrate may affect the ionization of aminoacid groups at the active site of
                    gp63 or other groups elsewhere that are responsibie for maintaining the active
                    conformation of the enzyme.</p>

                <p>Two splenectomised chimpanzees, named Marcel and Theo, were infected with blood
                    stages of the second major human malaria parasite P. vivax. Tens of thousands of
                    female Anopheles stephensi mosquitoes were fed on the parasitised blood with the
                    aid of artificial membrane feeders. A third chimpanzee, named Femma, was
                    immunised at two different occasions with the sporozoites from the infected
                    mosquitoes by a direct, interrupted feeding procedure. Determination of the
                    humoral immune response revealed that a very strong antibody response towards
                    the sporozoites was induced, especially after the second challenging. Currently,
                    T-cell lines specific Br Pr vivax circumsporozoite protein have been isolated.
                    The cloning of these specific T-cells is in progress. The anti-sera from Theo,
                    who was challenged with blood stages twice, can be used as a readily available
                    source for P. vivax blood stage antibodies. The serum of Femma, who was kept
                    under chloroquin prophylaxis during the entire experiment, is a potential source
                    of antibodies towards P. vivax Rene antigens.</p>
                <p>The splenectomised chimpanzees Theo and Marcel were bled (about 500 ml) and the
                    parasites present in the blood were purified. Several hundreds of micrograms of
                    relatively pure genomic parasite DNA, which will be used for the construction of
                    genomic libraries, was isolated. RNA has been isolated at various stages during
                    the syachronous in vivo and in vitro growth of the parasite. Using a molecular
                    probe for the precursor of the major merozoite surface antigen (PMMSA) it was
                    demonstrated on Northern blots that this gene is expressed during late
                    schizogony. The mRNA has an apparent size of about 6.5 kB, which is not in
                    disagreement with the large molecular weight of the protein (over 200 kD). Using
                    RNA from ringforms, 24 hr old trophozoites and schizonts as a template, cDNA has
                    been prepared. After amplification of this cCDNA by a PCR-based method, it was
                    cloned in lambda gt11l DNA [1] and from one of the resulting. libraries a cDNA
                    clone (13 kB in length) cross-hybridising with a P. vivax PMMSA gene probe has
                    been isolated (collaboration with Dr. Peter David, Institute Pasteur, Paris,
                    France). In the near future the librariés will be screened with the sera from
                    chimpanzees Femma and Theo.</p>

                    fragments specific for Taenia Taiwan and T. saginata, respectively, when genomic
                    DNA is amplified by the polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Using this technique,
                    we are able to determine the identity of the cestodes using a single proglottid
                    and less than 500 ng of genomic DNA per reaction. Furthermore, comparison of
                    Taenia Taiwan PCR products to those of Taenia from Korea and geographical
                    isolates of T. saginata indicates that the Taenia Taiwan exists in other parts
                    of Eastern Asia and that adult morphology is insufficient to detect Taenia
                    Taiwan in other locations.</p>

                    immunofluorescence. Immunogold localization on Lowicryl K,M ultrathin sections
                    showed a specific labeling of micronemes. The apparent molecular weight of these
                    proteins were respectivly of 100 and 90 kDa as determined by western blotting
                    and after metabolic labeling and immunoprecipitation. Reduction by
                    dithiothreitol of the 90 kDa produced a 38 kDa protein which suggests that the
                    mature protein is a dimer of two 38 kDa proteins linked by disulfide bridges.
                    Pulse chase labeling followed by immunoprecipitation showed that the 38 KDA
                    protein is processed from a 40 kDA precursor.</p>

                <p>Leishmania donovani P-type ATPase An ATPase on the plasma membrane of Leishmania
                    donovani has been characterized. An antiserum, generated against ATPase active
                    bands from native gels, was specific for a 105 Kä protein in promastigotes.
                    However, in plasma membrane preparations the antiserum predominantly recognizes
                    a 70 Kä protein, suggesting proteolysis of the native, intact protein.</p>
                <p>nt FT NS of L. donovani promastigotes and plasma membranes with gamma [ -ATP
                    results in the phosphorylation of a 105 Kd and 70 Kd pro- tein. This
                    phosphorylation is sensitive to increasing amounts of vana- date, an analog of
                    phosphate. These data suggest that the L. donovani enzyme forms a transient
                    phosphorylated intermediate, characteristic of a ‘'p'-type ATPase. Western blot
                    analyses indicate that this protein is equally present in amastigotes and
                    promastigotes. Immunostaining of permeabilized promastigotes and amastigotes
                    show diffuse staining of the parasite surface, which is consistent with ar; îce
                    membrane protein.</p>
                <p>The antiserum immunoprecipitates a 70 Kd, C]-DCCD binding protein from whole
                    cells and plasma membranes of drones Ligotes Furthermore the anti- serum
                    immunoprecipitates a 105 Kä and 70 Kd protein which can be subse- quently
                    phosphorylated. These results indicate the presence of a 105 Kd ‘p'-type ATPase
                    on the L. donovani plasma membrane which is similar to the mammalian and fungal
                    cation pumps.</p>

                    and only 2 of the polyclonal antisera reacted with the parasites in both assays.
                    Each antiserum detected a different protein associated with Triton
                    X100-insoluble cytoskeleton of bloodstream forms. One protein, 13-p4l, was
                    localized primarily in the flagellar pocket and in the cytoplasm between the
                    pocket and the golgi where coated-vesicles are known to be abundant.</p>
                <p>Protein 14-p46 is localized almost exclusively in the flagellar adhesion

                <p>Cryptosporidium sp., monoclonal antibodies, ultrastructural immunodetection,
                    western blot The antigenic structure of Cryptosporidium sp. at different
                    development stages was analyzed.15monoclonal antibodies (McAb) raised against
                    oocyst walls and sporozoïtes were used in western blot on purified oocysts and
                    in immunoelectron microscopy on infected rat ileum. Four distinct epitopes were
                    characterized. An antigen of 20 kilodaltons (kd) is located in the cytoplasm of
                    all developmental stages. À complex antigen with major bands ranging from 40 to
                    200 kd is found at the surface of trophozoïites, merozoïtes, macrogamonts and
                    oocysts. À third McAb reacts weakly with the merozoïte membrane and recognizes
                    13 distinct bands from 50 to 210 kd. A IgM isotype McAb binds an oocyst wall
                    antigen and reacts with major bands ranging from approximately 40 to 250 kd. We
                    have thus identified stage specific as well as stable epitopes of
                    Cryptosporidium sp.. The complex pattern observed in western blot with some McAb
                    suggests that the corresponding epitopes might be located on glycoproteins.</p>

                    et al, in prep) have been localized on Toxoplasma gondii ultrathin sections
                    using four monoclonal antibodies (Mab) (IE 0° ILg; Gr and IV,,) which detect
                    membrane and cytoplasmic antigens (Bonhomme et “al, 1989).</p>
                <p>Thi sections as well as the whole surface of RH tachyzoïîtes of T.gondii are

                    complex.</p>
                <p>In the present study, the quantification of gold labelling was performed with the
                    help of a semi-automatic procedure developed by us (Lebonvallet et al, 1990)
                    whieh uses digital images stored in an image analysis system (Bio 500, BIOCOM,

                <p>The gold particles are quantified per pm’ inside three cellular compartments
                    rhoptries, submembrane area and surface membrane, drawn on the video screen. The
                    density of labelling was more important in the rhoptries than on the cell
                    surface for the proteins of 66-70 kDa and 43-45 kDa recognized by Mab IE, et II
                    respectively.</p>
                <p>Proteins of 30 kDa detected with Mab GII, essentially found on the cell surface
                    were poorly labelled in the rhoptries. For thé proteins of 28 kDa recognized by
                    Mab IV, ; the labelling was very intensive in the submembrane area. Control
                    labelling background was quantified without Mab, in the remaining cellular
                    compartments and in the acellular compartments. The results support the
                    hypothesis that rhoptries are the essential cellular compartments where the
                    immunodominant antigens are synthezised, in different proportions.</p>

                    immuno-localization Both. adult Filariae and microfilariae contain significant
                    concentrations of the antioxidant enzyme superoxide dismutase (SOD) (Callahan et
                    al. in press). Adult D. immitis also secrete SOD in in vitro culture. It has
                    been suggested that this enzyme may not only perform a housekeeping role in
                    these worms but that it may also assist in defense against oxidants generated by
                    host immune cells. This study aimed to determine the anatomic localization of
                    SOD in D. immitis. SOD was purified from homogenized/sonicated adult worms by
                    ion exchange and gel filtration chromatography, followed by SDS-PAGE and
                    electro-elution onto nitrocellulose. This partially purified antigen was mixed
                    1:2 with Freund's complete adjuvant and used to raise a rabbit antiserum. 10 um
                    sections of adult D. immitis were deparaffinized, hydrated, washed in 3%
                    hydrogen peroxide and immunostained using the rabbit anti-D.</p>
                <p>immitis SOD antiserum and a Vectastain ABC kit. Controls consisted of pre-immune
                    serum and serum absorbed against the D. immitis SOD. Cytosolic regions of the
                    amyofibrillar portions of somatic muscle blocks ih both male and female worms
                    were stained. Muscle cells surrounding the dorsal and ventral nerve chords
                    stained most intensely and here the myofibrilar portions of the cells were also
                    stained. No significant staining was observed in the digestive tract except for
                    an anterior thicker-walled, apparently glandular, segment. Granular portions of
                    this structure stained lightly. The cuticle and the external cuticle surface
                    were not stained. In the reproductive tract feint staining was limited to
                    “nurse” cells associated with microfilariae in the uterus, however, in more
                    posterior sections developing embryos were also stained feintly. The testes
                    stained lightly. These results suggest that SOD may be required to help protect
                    the main nerve trunks, the cells lining the anterior digestive tract and to a
                    lesser extent the reproductive tract, from oxidants. The glandular portion of
                    the gut and/or the amyofibrillar regions of the muscle blocks may be responsible
                    for secreting the SOD observed in in vitro culture of adult worms.</p>

                <p>The role of the cell surface membrane components to the survival and
                    pathogenicity of intracellular parasites is subject of several studies. Human
                    leishmanioses presents a wide range of clinical symptons often healing
                    spontaneously or leading to disfigure- mnt and death. In order to characterize
                    the cell surface of promastigotes forms of The Leishmania parasites, we have
                    used both the enzyme cytochemical method with cerium ions as capture agent and
                    an immunological approach at the electron microscope level to igcalize plasma
                    membrane 5'-NT in four species of the genus Leishmania.For imminogold
                    cytochemical labelling, cells were fixed for 15 min in 1% PFA and 1% GA at pH
                    6.0. The cells sections were labeled with a rabbit antiserum against 5'-NT, used
                    at a dilution Of 1:10 for 90 min at 209C. The immnogold label, IgG goat
                    anti-rabbit or protein A complexed to colloïidal gold particles was used at a
                    dilution of 1:2.</p>

                    pocket Of Leishmania mexicana, L. doñovani, L. amazonensis and L. chagasi. It
                    seems to us that there was no quantitative differences in the expression of the
                    D'NT enzyme activity in the four species of the parasite.The imminogold
                    labelling was localized in the plasma membrane and flagellum of the four species
                    of Leishmania confirming in a inequivocal fashion these results.</p>
                <p>This post-embedding technique for immunolocalization of S'NT enzyme activity that
                    was used in this work can be considered a better approach for high resolution

                    to produce monoclonal antibodies against liver-stage specific determinants of
                    this rodent parasite, we have identified determinants that are expressed
                    transiently on blood stage schizonts. In both stages the cytomeric membrane is
                    brilliantly illuminated by indirect immunofluorescence. Western immuno- blot
                    analyses of exo-erythrocytic schizont preparations show clearly that 2 MAbs
                    (23.19.1 and 23.21.6) bind to an apparently common molecule of 82 kd.
                    Ironically, the scarcity of the blood stage determinant has frustrated
                    immunoblot analysis at this level, but new methods of background depletion,
                    schizont enrichment, or pre- immunoprecipitation, may enhance identification of

                    Immune serum against these two species was produced in rabbits in response to
                    inoculation of somatic antigens of the protozoans. Using fluorescent serum anti
                    rabbit globulin, fluorescent reactions were observed with specimens of fresch
                    cultures of these two species of trichomonad. In the reactions between these
                    immune sera and antigens of each one of the especies the largest number of
                    precipitating lines was observed between homologous system using gel
                    imnunodiffusion. Using the Outcherlony technique the antigens of T. suis and T.
                    foetus showed 1, 2, 3 or 4 lines in the A antigenic group and 1 and 2
                    precipitating lines in group B. The results obtained with immune sera of T. suis
                    and T. foetus indicated that both Tritrichomonas has identical antigens, or at
                    least a closely antigenic structure.</p>
                <p>The antigens prepared from T. suis and T. foetus were separated by œl
                    immunoelectrophoresis and reacted with the immune sera of each species of

                    obtained from reactions between antigens and their homologous immune sera. The

                    purify by FPLC and characterize a 37 kDa proteinase having an isoelectric point
                    4.5-4.6, and an optimal activity at pH 5.0. The enzyme was moderatly inhibited
                    by pepstatin, and strongly inhibited by HgCl12, ZnCl2, suggesting the presence
                    of a thiol group close to or at the active site. The strong inhibition with
                    chymostatin, leupeptin, and aprotinin is in agreement with à serine or a
                    cysteine proteinase nature. These properties differ from the P. lophurae (1) and
                    P. falciparum cathepsin D-like enzymes, and from the serine or cysteine neutral
                    proteinases s0 far described in P. falciparum and P. berghei (2). The parasite
                    origin of the Pf37 proteinase was clearly demonstrated since the radiolabelled
                    enzyme was purified from [35S]-methionine labelled parasites.</p>
                <p>An anti-Pf37 antiserum, tested by immunoblotting, immunoprecipitation and
                    enzymatic activity inhibition, allowed us to localize the enzyme. By
                    immunofluorescence, spot staining on trophozoites and diffuse staining on
                    segmented schizontes were observed.</p>
                <p>The synthesis of specific inhibitors of this enzyme will be of interest to
                    determine if this proteinase is involved in the in vitro meraozoite release, or

                    basis of host-parasite interactions mostly consist of exchanges of signal
                    molecules that facilitate the mutual adaptation of both organisms. In the
                    infection by Schistosoma mansoni, evidence has been brought for instance that
                    this parasite can synthesize molecules inhibiting the host immune response.</p>
                <p>Since neuropeptides are now established to exhibit several immunomodulatory
                    properties, we have postulated the possible role of S, mansoni neuropeptides in
                    parasite immune evasion. Radioimmunoassays detected significant amounts of
                    bêta-endorphin, ACTH and alpha-MSH in all stages of S, mansoni life cycle.
                    Parasite bêta-endorphin like peptide and human bêta-endorphin 1-31 were shown to
                    co-elute in reverse-phase HPLC, suggesting a high homology of both molecules.
                    These three peptides derive from the common pro-opiomelanocortin (POMC)
                    precursor. By taking advantage of the sequences of POMC genes established in
                    several vertebrate species, phylogenetically conserved nucleotide sequences were
                    chosen to search for a POMC gene in S, mansoni genome. We could detect the
                    presence of a POMC-related gene, and of a POMC-related mRNA, with a size similar
                    to mouse brain POMC RNA, in the parasite.</p>

                    to &gt;90 kDa were recognized. Six monoclonal antibodies recognized granules of
                    150-400 nm in the vicinity of the golgi complex but not identical with dense
                    granules. Two monoclonal antibodies were specific for micronemes of cystozoites

                    an increasing number of vertebrate peptides have been demonstrated
                    immunocytochemically in parasites, the amino acid sequence of a "native"
                    parasite peptide has yet to be determined.</p>
                <p>F. hepatica contains a peptide immunologically related to members of the
                    pancreatic polypeptide (PP) family of regulatory peptides. Use of antisera of
                    different regional specificities for PP and peptide YY (PYY) revealed
                    immunoreactivity (IR) throughout the CNS and PNS. In particular, PP-IR was
                    present in two groups of cells at the entrance and exit, respectively, of the
                    ootype, whilst PYY-immunoreactive cells occurred amongst the Mehlis' gland cells
                    surrounding the ootype. The peptide occurs at a concentration of 40 ng/g wet
                    weight of fluke, based on a radioimmunoassay for PP-IR. Gel permeation
                    chromatography has shown that the Fasciola peptide is similar in size to
                    mammalian (bovine) PP. The peptide has been purified to homogeneity, using
                    reverse-phase and ion exchange HPLC, and sequenced by means of automated
                    gas-phase Edman degradation. The sequence obtained represents just over half of
                    the predicted molecule, but the more conserved and functionally active
                    C-terminal region of the molecule has yet to be identified.</p>
                <p>The distribution of the Fasciola peptide within the fluke suggests that it could
                    serve important roles in neurotransmission, neuromuscular co-ordination and the
                    regulation of the highly-synchronised mechanism of egg production. These three
                    processes are vital to the survival of the fluke.</p>

                <p>In humans, clinical infection with B.divergens has been found only in
                    immunocompromised individuals and is generally fatal without treatment. Two
                    isolates of B. divergens, 1 from a human infection in Scotland (J strain) and
                    the other from a bovine infection (Weybridge strain), are currently being
                    maintained in human erythrocytes, using the microaerophilus stationary phase
                    (MASP) culture system.</p>
                <p>A monoclonal antibody, Mab 13,4, raised to Weybridge merozoites from bovine
                    cultures has been shown to identify a 24KD antigen present on the surface of B.
                    bovis and B. bigemina merozoites, as well as on B. divergens merozoites from
                    bovine cultures. Mab 13.4 inhibits merozoite invasion in vitro and the affinity
                    purified antigen is partially protective of gerbils agaiñst subsequent challenge
                    with B. divergens. Mab 13.4 will bind to J and Weybridge merozoites which have
                    been cultured in bovine erythrocytes but not after their culture in human
                    erythrocytes. This has been shown by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA),
                    indirect immunofluorescent antibody test (IFAT) and immunoblotting
                    techniques.</p>
                <p>One theory to account for the absence or possible alteration of this antigen in
                    the human system is that the antigen is associated with the use of different
                    erythrocyte receptors for invasion. When cultured in human erythrocytes J and
                    Weybridge strains can still induce fatal infections in gerbils. Also, the
                    strains have been returned to bovine culture after long term culture in human
                    cells, which demonstrates that the antigenic alterations are transient.</p>

                <p>The parent line KF 1776 was found to bind to both C32 melanoma cells and human
                    umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC). Examination of this isolate by
                    electron microscopy showed that knobs i.e. electron dense protuberances, which
                    are necessary but not sufficient for cytoadherence in vivo, were present on the
                    erythrocyte membrane. Isolate KF 1776 also bound to the leukocyte
                    differentiation antigen CD36 which has been shown to be a cyto- adherence
                    receptor for P. falciparum. In contrast, a clone of this isolate designated
                    1776/PSBC10 was found to have knobs but did not have the capacity to bind to C32
                    melanoma cells, HUVEC and CD36. This clone represents an interesting phenotype

                <p>variant surface glycoprotein - shedding - cell immobilization In complement
                    Ilysis tests, Trypanosoma congolense bloodstream forms were lysed in the
                    presence of specific antibodies against variant surface glycoprotein (VSG) and
                    guinea pig complement. Preincubation with antibodies before addition of
                    complement enabled the parasites to escape from Ilysis by a time- and
                    temperature-dependent mechanism.</p>
                <p>Immunofiuorescence revealed that preincubation caused removal of the antibodies
                    from the cell surface and their accumulation between aggregated cells. Addition
                    of secondary antibodies or of the first complement component Ciq did not enhance
                    this process. Single immobilized trypanosomes were incubated with anti-VSG under
                    corresponding conditions in order to eliminate effects due to cell aggregation.
                    In these experiments, the antibodies were neither capped nor shed from the cell
                    surface unless coincubation with secondary antibodies or C1q was performed.
                    Thus, shedding of immune complexes in T. congolense occurs in the absence of
                    secondary ligands - obviously Simply by cell aggregation. This mechanism might
                    therefore be of significance also in vivo.</p>

                    with a polyclonal antibody directed against rabbit muscular myosin. This
                    myosin-like polypeptide was detected in SDS-PAGE in trophozoite ghosts but not
                    in the cytoplasmic or sexual stages extracts, suggesting that the expression of
                    the protein is sStage-dependent. The absence of the myosin-like protein from the
                    sexual stages correlated the disappearance of the three cortical membranes of
                    the trophozoites and other cortical structures.</p>
                <p>Immunof luorescence showed the presence of this polypeptide in the anterior part

                    are probably dependent of a actin-myosin system.</p>

                <p>Leishmania, lipophosphoglycan, amastigote LPG is an abundant surface antigen in
                    Leishmania species. Promastigote LPG is instrumental in the initiation of
                    infection, serving as a ligand for specific binding to host macrophages.
                    Additionally, LPG is implicated as a protective T cell antigen because
                    vaccination with promastigote LPG protects susceptible mice against infection.
                    Little is known about LPG on the pathogenic amastigote stage. This study,
                    designed to identify surface antigens unique to amastigotes, demonstrates that
                    amastigotes of L. major express a form of LPG which is distinct from
                    promastigote LPG. Amastigotes were isolated from lesions on nude mice and the
                    integral membrane fraction was collected using Triton X-114 detergent
                    fractionation. A rabbit antiserum raised against this fraction was used on
                    Western blots to identify amastigote-specific molecules. Biosynthetic and
                    surface labelling techniques as well as immunochemical studies were used to
                    characterize amastigote- specific molecules. Amastigotes express a high
                    molecular weight LPG which is recognized by a monoclonal antibody cross reactive
                    with LPG from many Leishmania species. This amastigote LPG is not recognized by
                    a monoclonal antibody against L.major promastigote LPG or by a polyclonal
                    antiserum against the promastigote integral membrane fraction. This amastigote
                    LPG can be surface-labelled with galactose and is biosynthetically labelled
                    using glucose. In an amastigote-to-promastigote transformation experiment over
                    an 8 day period, amastigote LPG could be detected with gradual changes in
                    molecular weight for up to 48 hours, but was undetected after subculture at 3
                    days. Promastigote LPG was first detected at 48 hours and persisted through day

                <p>The surface of the Toxoplasma tachyzoite is dominated by five major proteins.
                    Monoclonal antibodies against these surface molecules were used in an in vitro
                    assay to determine their functional role in invasion of the host cell. Two of
                    the antibodies were shown to have an opposing effect; C1E3 (anti P30)
                    significantly blocking invasion while 3G1i (anti P22) caused significant
                    enhancement. Antibodies against the three remaining antigens (P93, P35 &amp;
                    P42), did not influence invasion. The study was extended to determine the effect
                    of antibody pretreatment on the intracellular survival and multiplication of
                    those parasites which had succeeded in invasion. Light and electron microscopy
                    were used to monitor antibody redistribution during invasion, using
                    immunofluorescence and peroxidase staining.</p>

                <p>Tubulin, Immunogold, Immunofluorescence, T. brucei We have used monoclonal
                    antibodies to define novel components of the T. brucei cytoskeleton.
                    (Post-translationally modified forms of tubulin; basal body, microtubule
                    associated proteins, flagellar axoneme, basal body and rod proteins, etc.,).
                    These proteins have been identified by Western blotting and their location
                    determined by immunof luorescence and immunogold techniques on sections and
                    whole cytoskeletons. We have developed methods for identifying the modulation of
                    cytoskeletal components with the position of the cell in the cell cycle. These
                    approaches have been used to study the detryonsination of tubulin as à marker
                    for microtubule assembly within the cytoskeleton. We will present a model for
                    construction, modulation and division of the microtubule cytoskeleton of T.

                    localization in larvae of T. spiralis, treated and untreated with Oxfendazole,
                    were studied. The immunohistochemical techniques of peroxida- se and protein
                    A-gold were used.</p>
                <p>Swiss NHR white mice were infected with T. spiralis larvae, and treated after 31,
                    32 and 33 days post-infection. Animals were killed on days 1, 2, 3, 5, 7 and 15
                    post-treatment (p.t.). An untreated group was used as control.</p>
                <p>Muscular samples were studied by immunoperoxidase and protein A-gold techniques,
                    with light and electron microscopy. Antisera were obteined from dogs and rabbits
                    experimentally infected with T. spiralis and the selected working dilution was
                    1/2000. The conjugate protein A-peroxidase was used to the 1/100 dilution and
                    the conjugate protein A-gold to the 1/10 dilution.</p>
                <p>With light microscopy and the immunoperoxidase method we observed a similar
                    reaction in the stichocytes at 24 hours p.t. than in control groups. In the
                    cuticle, the reaction was less noticeable. In the animals killed later (2, 3 5,
                    7 and 15 days p.t.) the reaction decreased until became almost negative in the
                    last group. By electron microscopy and the protein A-gold method, the results
                    were very similar to those obtained with immunoperoxidase method. In the first
                    treated group we found coloidal gold particles in the globules of the
                    stichocytes, in the epicuticle and in vesicles of the nurse cell. In the other
                    groups we found that these particles are progresively disappearing, at the same
                    time that we observed a progressive degeneration of the parasite.</p>

                <p>Diclidophora - reproductive system - innervation - neuropeptides Egg assembly in
                    trematodes takes place as a result of an orderly series of contractions and
                    relaxations of the smooth muscle surrounding the proximal ducts of the female
                    reproductive apparatus. Regulation of this motility presumably resides in the
                    associated nervous system, but how events are initiated and controlled have yet
                    to be determined. Using immunocytochemical methods, in conjunction with electron
                    microscopy and confocal scanning laser microscopy, this paper records the
                    finding of an extensive network of peptidergic ganglia and nerve fibres in the
                    wall of the egg-chamber (ootype) and associated ducts of the monogenean
                    parasite, Diclidophora merlangi. Demonstrable immunoreactivity to the regulatory
                    peptides: pancreatic polypeptide (PP), peptide YY (PYY), gastrin/cholecystokinin
                    (CCK), neurokinin A (NKA), eledoisin and FMRFamide was evident in a
                    heterogeneous population (&gt;100) of uni-, bi- and multi-polar somata. The
                    somata display all of the ultrastructural characteristics of
                    protein-synthesizing cells and produce numerous dense-core secretory granules
                    that accumulate in fine cytoplasmic extensions. The extensions terminate in the
                    ootype wall and in close apposition to smooth muscle fibres. It is concluded
                    that there is à peptidergic-modulator involvement în the trematode egg-forming
                    sequence.</p>

                <p>Encephalitozoon cuniculi has a wide host range among rodents, rabbits, carnivores
                    and primates.</p>
                <p>Prior to the acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) epidemic only two
                    clinical cases of human encephalitozoonosis had been confirmed but further cases
                    have been reported in AIDS patients. The investigation was initiated to
                    determine whether sub-clinical infections occur in manne Immunoblotting of
                    SDS-PAGE protein profiles of Percoll-purified spores of Encephalitozoon cuniculi
                    with serum from experimentally infected mice revealed multiple bands of
                    molecular weights between 20KD and &gt;130KD. The most reactive band was at
                    50-60KD and this appeared to correspond to a protein recognised by two
                    monoclonal antibodies raised from hybridising spleen cells from infected mice
                    with myeloma cells. The monoclonal antibodies have been used to isolate this
                    strongly immunogenic protein by affinity chromatography.</p>
                <p>Twenty five sera from patients with tropical diseases and eleven from patients
                    with psychiatric or neurological disorders, which had given anti-E. cuniculi
                    antibody titres of 1:800-1:»1,3200 by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA),
                    also gave positive reactions in the indirect immunofluorescent antibody test
                    (IFAT) and/or peroxidase anti-peroxidase test (PAP). Sera from 10 of these
                    patients (3 with malaria, 3 with schistosomiasis, 3 with bancroftian filariasis
                    and 1 epileptic), with antibody titres of 1:1,600-1:&gt;3,200 were further
                    examined by Western blotting of SDS-PAGE protein profiles and all gave binding
                    patterns identical to those of experimentally infected rabbit and mouse sera. It
                    is concluded that sub-clinical infection of E. cuniculi are quite common in man.
                    Reactivation of such latent infections may account for the recently reported
                    cases of hepatitis, peritonitis and keratitis in AIDS patients caused by E.

                    Toxoplasma gondii, dense granule, rhoptry The characterization of the contents
                    of rhoptries and dense granules of Toxoplasma gondii tachyzoites has been
                    undertaken in order to study their respective role in the interaction between
                    these organisms and their host cell. À rhoptry-dense granule fraction has been
                    isolated by subcellular fractionation. Monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies have
                    been raised against the fraction. Six major rhoptry proteins and three major
                    dense granule proteins have been identified by immunoelectronmicroscopy, 2-D gel
                    electrophoresis and western blotting. The rhoptry molecules are: a 61 KkDa,pl
                    5.6 (identical to PEF described by
                    Schwartzman&amp;Krug,Exp.Parasitol.68,74,1989), a family of 3 proteins of 55,59
                    and 60 kDa, pl over 8 (described by Sadak et al,Molec.Biochem.</p>
                <p>Parasitol.29,203,1988), a 59.5 kDa,pl over 8, and a 43 kDa,pl 4.8. The dense
                    granule proteins are: a 27 kDa,pl 4.8 (identical to the 23 kDa antigen described
                    by Cesbron et al,P.N.A.S.86,7537,1989), a 28 kDa,pl 7.8 and a 30 kDa,pl 5.6.
                    Immunoelectron microscopy showed that the 61 kDa rhoptry antigen was detected in
                    the parasitophorous vacuole membrane of newly invaded cells. The 3 dense granule
                    proteins were detected on the vacuolar vesicular network, but the 30 KDa was
                    unique in being also found on the vacuolar membrane. Recombinant lambda gti1
                    clones encoding part of the rhoptry proteins of 61 kDa and 55-59 kDa have been
                    isolated from a T. gondii genomic library and are being used for determining the
                    sequences of the corresponding genes.</p>

                    cytoskeleton - tegument - actin - actin-binding proteins Antisera to vertebrate
                    actin and actin-binding proteins were used to characterize cytoskeletal proteins
                    in the tegument of adult Schistosoma mansoni. Actin, æactinin and tropomyosin
                    immunoreactivities were detected in the cytoplasm of the apical tegument. Since
                    actin filaments are not normally observed here these proteins may serve as a
                    reserve for assembly durinc repair processes. Antiserum to æ«actininfpund to the
                    teoumental spines and this protein may be involved in cross-linkino of actin

                    with Beverley strain was used for immunoscreening of the cDNA library to isolate
                    the positive clones encoding parasitic antigen. The clone-specific antibody to B
                    -galactosidase fusion protein expressed in E. coli was extracted from infected
                    serum by the epitope selection. At least 20 positive clones encoding independent
                    epitope were isolated from more than 80 positive clones using epitope- selected
                    antibodies. Molecular weight and intracellular localization of the antigen
                    corresponding to each clone were examined using selected antibodies. 27,28,34,40
                    and 60 kD tachyzoite antigens independently reacted with each epitope selected
                    antibody. The an- tibody reacted with 34 kD antigen also immunoprecipitated the
                    32 kD in vitro translation product of mRNA from tachyzoite. Immunoelectron
                    microscopy demonstrated all of the antigens are located at dense granule of
                    tachyzoite. This organella was supposed to be exocytic and involved in the
                    formation of parasitophorous vacuole. Analysis of the dense granule would be an
                    important step to study invasive mechanisms of the parasite into the host

                    immunoreactivity (IR) in the nervous system of the cestode, M. expansa and to
                    quantify, characterise and purify this parasite neuropeptide. Using
                    immunocytochemical methods and confocal scanning laser microscopy,
                    immunoreactivity to the 3 members of the pancreatic polypeptide family, namely
                    PP, peptide YY (PYY) and neuropeptide Y (NPY) has been identified in the nervous
                    system of M. expansa.</p>
                <p>Immunostaining for this peptide family occurred throughout the central and
                    peripheral nervous systems of the worm in an extensive network of nerve fibres
                    and cell bodies associated with the scolex, proglottides and paired reproductive
                    ducts. PP-, PYY- and NPY-immunoreactivities were co-localised, suggesting the
                    presence of a single native parasite peptide. Radioïimmunoassays (RIAs) for
                    PP-IR in parasite extracts, using an antiserum directed to the conserved
                    C-terminal hexapeptide amide (LTRPRY.NH2), measured 192.8 ng/g of PP-IR.
                    However, a battery of antisera which cross-react with the C-terminal regions of
                    PYY and NPY failed to detect the parasite neuropeptide under immunoassay
                    conditions, suggesting that the peptide has more structural homology with PP
                    than PYY or NPY. Gel permeation chromatography of parasite extracts yielded a
                    single molecular species of PP-IR with a molecular weight similar to bovine PP
                    (ca.</p>
                <p>4000 daltons). Further chromatographic characterisation of the parasite peptide
                    using rpHPLC identified a peptide that had immunochemical characteristics which
                    differed from PP, PYY and NPY and may, therefore, represent a new member of this
                    peptide family.</p>

                <p>GIARDIA LAMBLIA: CHARACTERIZATION OF THE 88kDa SURFACE ANTIGEN T.D. licHugh,

                    Smithfield, London ECIA 7BE Giardia, immunofluorescence, monoclonal antibody,
                    antigen We have identified an 88kDa antigen expressed by Giardia lamblia (GL)
                    trophozoites which is an imnunogen in humans. The biochemical nature of this
                    antigen is unclear and it is not known whether the epitope is expressed in all
                    human animal GL isolates. Using an anti-88kDa mouse monoclonal (IgG 1) antibody
                    (Mab) and the immmofluorescent antibody technique (IFAT) 8 isolates of GL were
                    screened for expression of the 88kDa antigen. The recognition of the 88kDa
                    epitope was assessed as the proportion of trophozoites showing positive
                    imnunofluorescence. The ‘isolates exhibited a range of recognition from 2.1%
                    (Port-1) to 23.5% (VNB5) when live parasites were screened. In these conditions
                    binding of antibody to GL was exclusively a surface pehnomenon. However, when
                    methanol-fixed GL were studied the range of antibody recognition was increased
                    to 66-92% and cytoplasmic binding of antibody was noted. In order to
                    characterise the 88kDa epitope live GL troph- ozoites were studied by
                    proteolysis, periodate oxidation and competitive lecting binding followed by
                    antibody binding studies. The antigen was sensitive to the proteolytic action of
                    trypsin, chymotrypsin and protease E (1mg/ml, 23°C, 15 min) and oxidation with
                    sodium metaperiodate (0.05M, 23°C, 15 min). However, treatment with wheat germ
                    agglu- tinin and concanavalin A (10ug/ml, 20°C, 30 min) did not alter antibody
                    binding. Thus, the 88kDa immunogen is common to all GL isolates studied,
                    although its expression as a surface antigen varies. The sensitivity of the
                    surface epitope to periodate treatment suggests that is is a glycoprotein.</p>

                <p>Hymenolepis - cestode - regulatory peptides - rejection The H. diminuta-C57 mouse
                    system has been used as à model in an attempt to characterise the intestinal
                    cellular response to à cestode parasite, and to investigate any correlative
                    changes in the levels of gut regulatory peptides that may accompany the
                    rejection phenomenon. Male 6 - 8-week-old mice were infected with a
                    5-cysticercoid burden of the rat tapeworm, H. diminuta, then autopsied at
                    intervals following a 28-day primary and 14-day secondary infection
                    (administered 28 days post- primary-infection). The smali intestine was excised
                    and two regions processed for histological examination (20-30% and 60-70%
                    distance from pylorus), while the remainder of the tissue was extracted for
                    quantification of selected regulatory peptides. Mice sham-infected with Hanks'
                    saline served as controls. Results have shown a statistically-significant
                    increase in intestinal goblet cell and serotonin- positive enterochromaffin cell
                    number and in the average intestinal crypt depth in the hind gut (60-70% region)
                    of infected mice, following both a primary and secondary infection. Of the 10
                    radioimmunoassays (gastrin, gastrin-releasing peptide [GRP], glucagon, motilin,
                    neurotensin [NT], pancreatic polypeptide [PP], peptide histidine isoleucine
                    [PHI], somatostatin, substance P [SP] and vasoactive intestinal peptide [VIP])
                    employed, levels of 3 were elevated (glucagon, PP, SP) and 2 lowered (PHI, VIP)
                    in infected mice. Immunosuppressed mice and rats (normal host) served as
                    additional control groups. Results indicate that murine cestode rejection
                    involves an array of immunopathophysiological changes and that these responses
                    may be controlled, at least in part, by regulatory peptides acting via
                    neurocrine and/or endocrine mechanisms.</p>

                    hormones (GnRHs) are synthesized and secreted by the hypothalmus and effect the

                    is evolutionarily the most ancient of the series. Immunostaining was restricted
                    to the testes of the male worm and took the form of a reticular pattern
                    associated with the sustentacular cells, which ramify between the germinal cells
                    within the testis follicle. The sustentacular cells possess all the
                    ultrastructural features of protein-synthesizing cells and are believed to be
                    involved in the hormonal regulation of testicular function. Positive
                    immunoreactivity was also evident in the lining of the gynaecophoric canal,
                    adjacent to the testes, where the male and female worms are in most intimate
                    contact. A (gonadotropic?) peptide hormone in such a. location may be involved

                    have been determined using antisera to a range of vertebrate and Invertebrate
                    peptides. An indirect immunofluorescent technique was used, in conjunction with
                    epifluorescent and confocal microscopy. Positive immunoreactivity (IR) was
                    obtained with antisera to pancreatic polypeptide (PP), peptide YY (PYY),
                    substance P (SP), gastrin, cholecystokinin (CCK) and FMRFamide. Immunostaining
                    occurred throughout the CNS, although relatively fewer nerve fibres in the nerve
                    cords were immunostained for SP, gastrin and CCK than for the other 3 peptides.
                    PYY-IR was associated with the anterior sense organs, whilst CCK-IR occurred in
                    the tail phasmids.</p>
                <p>PYY-immunoreactive nerve fibres were present in the visceral nervous system
                    supplying the pharynx, the fibres displaying dendritic endings. FMRFamide-IR was
                    evident in the nerve supply to the intestine. In the female reproductive system,
                    no peptide IR was associated with the ovary although PP-, PYY- and FMRFamide-
                    immunoreactive nerve fibres were evident in the nerve plexus innervating the
                    vagina and distal region of the uterus. This plexus did not extend as far as the
                    bifurcation of the uterus. The results demonstrate that the nervous system of
                    Ascaris possesses numerous peptidergic neurones, with possible
                    neurotransmitter/neuromoduTatory roles.</p>

                    A monospecific polyclonal antibody obtained against a cysteine proteinase
                    isolated fran epimastigotes of Trypanosana cruzi was used for the
                    immunocytochemical localization of the protein by electron microscopy and to
                    analyse the role played by cysteine proteinase in the process of T. cruzi-host
                    cell interaction. Cytoplasmic structures which correspond to elements of the
                    endosamal-lysosanal (reservoscne) system found in epimastigote, amastigote and
                    trypomastigote forms reacted intensely by with colloidal gold labelled
                    antibodies. The surface of most of the tissue culture derived trypanastigotes
                    was not labelled. However, the flagellar pocket of this form was labelled. All
                    epimastigotes obtained fran axenic cultures and amastigote-like forms found üäin
                    the supernatant of vertebrate cells heavily infected with T. cruzi had their
                    surface intenselÿy labelled, indicating also the surface Ilocalization of the
                    protein. Incubation of the parasites in the presence of a sub-agglutinating
                    concentration of the anti-cysteine proteinase antibody led to a marked increase
                    in their uptake by macrophages. In contrast, addition of the F(ab'): portion of
                    the same antibody significantly reduced the infection of the macrophages with
                    the parasites. The results obtained strongly suggest an important participation
                    of cysteine proteinase in the process of T. cruzi-macrophage interaction.</p>

                    understood. We examined the reactivity of a monoclonal antibody (MAb), produced
                    against trophozoites of Enta- moeba histolytica strain HM-1:1IMSS, to more than
                    50 isolates of E.</p>
                <p>histolytica. The MAb reacted with all of 42 isolates and 4 clones showing
                    pathogenic zymodeme patterns: zymodeme (Z)-II, Z-IIa-, Z-VII, Z-XT, Z-XIV and
                    Z-XIX, regardless of culture conditions, geographical origins or symptoms of
                    host, in an indirect fluorescence antibody test.</p>
                <p>In contrast, the MAb failed to react with 14 isolates possessing non- pathogenic
                    zymodemes: Z-I and Z-VIII, nor did it react with other enter- ic protozoan
                    parasites, such as E. histolytica-like Laredo, E. hartman- ni, E. coli,
                    Endolimax nana, Dientamoeba fragilis, Trichomonas hominis and Giardia lamblia.
                    Western immunoblotting analysis showed that the molecular weight (M) of the
                    antigenic component recognized by the MAb was exclusively 30,000 in pathogenic
                    isolates of different zymodemes.</p>
                <p>These results demonstrate that the M, 30,006 antigen is a constant marker of
                    pathogenic isolates and that the indirect fluorescence anti- body test using the
                    MAb is useful for the accurate discrimination of pathogenic amebas. Molecular
                    cioning of the gene coding the M, 30,000 antigen is in progress.</p>

                    gondii(Tg) antigens recognized by antibodies from patients infected with this
                    parasite. Sera were obtained from two babies suffered from congenital toxoplas-
                    mosis and a mother who gave birth to one of the babies. Antibody titers examined
                    by the dye test (DT) were 1:4096 for the babies and the mother. Tg was isolated
                    from the cerebrospinal fluid of one baby patient and was maintained in our
                    laboratory (SK strain). Tachyzoites of Tg (RH and SK strain) were recovered from
                    the peritoneal cavity of ICR mice 3 days after infection. The organisms were
                    embedded in LR-white resin, polymerized at 37 C for 5 days and ultra-thin
                    sections were cut. After block- ing with skim milk, the sections were incubated
                    with diluted patient sera, then with rabbit anti-human IgG, IgM or total Igs
                    (Miles Lab.}). The sections were finally incu- bated with goat anti-rabbit IgG
                    conjugated with colloidal gold (Janssen Co.), and observed under an electron
                    microscope. Practically labeling was found to be localized to rhoptries,
                    micronemes and dense granules of Tg by any serum from the babies and the mother.
                    No differences were observed among labeling pattern for IgG and IgM anti- bodies
                    as secondary antibody. Normal sera from healthy young adults, whose DT titers
                    were less than 1:4, gave no specific labeling. Our results clearly indicate that
                    rhoptries, micronemes and dense granules contain molecules which are highly
                    immuno- genic for antibody production in the human host. Some authors suggest à
                    secretory function of these organelles. Thus, it is presumable that the
                    parasites secrete some of the antigens and induce antibody production.</p>

                    immunodiagnosis À cysteine proteinase which hydrolyzes host hemoglobin in vitro
                    was purified to homoge- neity from adult Fasciola worms and its properties were
                    characterized (Yamasaki, Aoki and Oya, 1989). In this paper, we examined
                    immunohistochemically the localization of this proteinase in the worm's tissues
                    to assess the physiological role of the enzyme.</p>
                <p>For this purpose, monoclonal antibodies specific for the proteinase were produced
                    and used for the localization of the enzyme by FITC-labeled or
                    peroxidase-labeled conjugates in the sections of the adult parasites, which were
                    embedded in Tissue TGK I resin or pa- raffin. When FITC-labeled anti-mouse IgG
                    was employed as the fluorescence probe, strong fluorescence was observed in the
                    epithelial cells of the intestinal mucosa in the fluke sections, whereas no
                    fluorescence was seen in the body surface, parenchymal tissues, and genital
                    organs. Using peroxidase-labeled conjugate as the immunohistochemical probe, the
                    Fasciola proteinase was found to be localized in a small granules, possibly
                    secretory granules, în the intestinal epithelial cells. Interestingly, host
                    erythrocytes in the worm's intestinal cavities had intensive staining with
                    peroxidase reaction, suggesting the presence of the enzyme in the
                    hemoglobin-rich erythrocytes. These findings suggest that the enzyme probably
                    existing in the granules is secreted into the intestinal lumen and plays an
                    important role in degradation of host hemoglobin as nutrient sources.</p>
                <p>The specificity and sensitivity of the partially purified Fasciola proteinase as
                    an an- tigen was examined by enzyme-1inked immunosorbent assay(ELISA).
                    Homologous combinations between the enzyme and fascioliasis sera gave the
                    highest absorbance, compared with the much lower absorbance observed in the
                    heterologous combinations between the Fasciola pro- teinase and other sera from
                    patients with schistosomiasis, paragonimiasis, and so on.</p>
                <p>Thus, the Fasciola proteinase should be valuable as à species-specific antigen

                    that is immunologically related to the human complement component C9. This
                    C9-related protein (TC9RP) has cytolytic activity for nucleated cells and forms
                    channels in planar phospholipid bilayers only at low pH, and probably
                    corresponds to the previously described T. cruzi hemolysin (N. W. Andrews &amp;

                    erythrocytes has been shown by video- and electron- microscopy to consist of a
                    series .of events and specific interactionsbetween the parasite and the host red
                    blood cell. In order to better understand the molecular basis of the events
                    during the invasion of susceptible red blood cells, we are identi- fying and
                    cloning the genes for merozoite proteins that exhibit specific receptor- like
                    binding to erythrocyte ligands. P. vivax invasion of erythrocytes has two
                    biological hallmarks: a dependence upon the Duffy glycoprotein in the reä cell

                    have identi- fied three merozoite proteins that bind specifically to susceptible
                    erythrocytes.</p>
                <p>One protein binds specifically to the Duffy glycoprotein, while another protein
                    has been shown by us to bind exclusively to human and other primate
                    reticulocytes. A third merozoite protein, equivalent in size to the major
                    merozoite surface glycoprotein, also binds to primate erythrocytes. Based upon
                    our functional data, these merozoite proteins are likely to be fundamental for
                    host red blood cell recognition and invasion in blood stage Vivax malaria.</p>

                    Cytoadherence of infected erythrocytes in the cerebral circulation may result in
                    the death of the host from cerebral malaria. Cytoadherence of infected
                    erythrocytes in vivo has been associated with the presence of knobs on the
                    erythrocyte surface but we have shown recently that cytoadherence to C32
                    melanoma cells may occur in vitro in the absence of knobs . We now show that a
                    knobless clone of P. falciparum adheres to the leukocyte differentiation
                    antigen, CD36, suggesting that binding to CD36 is independent of the presence of
                    knobs on the surface of the infected erythrocyte. This clone showed little
                    cytoadherence to thrombospondin or to endothelial cells express- ing ICAM 1.
                    Furthermore, a high molecular weight, trypsin-sensitive protein doublet was
                    immunoprecipitated from knobless trophozoite-infected erythrocytes. Finding a
                    molecule like the P. falciparum erythrocyte membrane protein 1 (PfEMP1) on these
                    cells is consistent with a role for PfEMP1 in cytoadherence to CD36 and C32
                    melanoma cells.</p>

                    Plasmodium - Sporozoiïite - Salivary gland - Binding - Dot blot The sporozoites
                    of plasmodia have the particularity to interact with the membranes of the
                    salivary glands of mosquitoes and mammalian hepatocytes. The circumsporozoite
                    protein, which covers the surface of the sporozoites and is found already in the
                    oocyst, was proposed to play a role in the interaction with the hepatocyte
                    membrane. We investigated its possible involvement in the process of the
                    salivary gland penetration.</p>
                <p>For this purpose an adhesion assay was developed using salivary glands coated
                    onto a nitrocellulose membrane and incubating the strips with iodinated
                    sporozoites. Three experimental models were used: Plasmodium gallinaceum in
                    Aedes aegypti, P.berghei and P.falciparum in Anopheles stephensi.</p>
                <p>Under appropriate conditions iodinated sporozoites bound to the immobilized
                    salivary glands. À binding was also detected to mosquito midgut tissue, but not
                    e.g. to casein, mucin and thyroglobulin. The binding could not be inhibited by
                    using anti- CSP antibodies in the incubation process.</p>
                <p>These results are taken as evidence that at least the repetitive epitopes of the
                    CSP are not directly involved in this adhesion process.</p>

                <p>malaria, serine protease, phospholipase C. invasion Parasite proteins with a
                    serine-protease like activity have been shown to be involved in the process of
                    red blood cell invasion. We have identified a 76 KkDa 2 falciparum membrane
                    protein (p76) using a monoclonal antibody, Hb31c13, which inhibits the {7 r/fro
                    growth of the parasite. Following cleavage of its glycosyl-phosphatidylinositol
                    (GPI) membrane anchor by a developmentally regulated parasite GPI-specific
                    phospholipase C, p76 displays a serine protease activity. The rodent malaria
                    parasite 2 chabaudi also has the same mechanism of serine protease regulation.
                    The accessibility in intact 2 cha4baudimerozoites of the serine protease to
                    specific inhibitors leads to a marked decrease in infectivity and suggests that
                    this protease plays an important role in red blood cell invasion.

                    It has been previously shown that the synthetic peptide Ala-His-His-Phe-Ser
                    (AHHFS) of glycophorin A is able to inhibit the invasion of human erythrocytes
                    by P.falciparum merozoites when introduced into in vitro cultures of the
                    parasite. The DNB conjugated AHHFS (104 M) used in IFA, labeled the parasite
                    surface with a rim-like pattern. No labelling was observed using P.knowlesi or
                    P.vivax, or Using a probe corresponding to another sequence of glycophorin
                    A.</p>
                <p>The AHHFS peptide coupled to Affigel-10, precipitated a 155 KkD antigen which was
                    recognized on Western blot by a monoclonal antibody specific of the Pf 155-
                    RESA. The binding of the Pf155-RESA to AHHFS-Affigel 10 was reversed by addition
                    of GLU-GLU dipeptide. Our results suggest that, during the invasion of
                    erythrocytes by merozoites, the Pf155-RESA could bind to the AHHFS domain of
                    glycophorin A through an interaction between His-His residues (positively
                    charged) and the repeated GIiu-Glu domains (negatively charged) of
                    Pf155-RESA.</p>
                <p>This acceptor-type interaction could help the binding of merozoites to

                    Plasmodium falciparum, erythrocyte rosetting Cerebral involvement is a feared
                    complication of Plasmodium falciparum malaria associated with sequestration of
                    infected red blood cells and occlusion of cerebral vessels. In addition to
                    Kknob-associated endothelial cytoadherence, erythrocyte rosetting, i.e.
                    spontaneous binding of uninfected rbcs to cells infected with late stage asexual
                    parasites, has been suggested as beeing responsible for the sequestration and
                    thus an important factor in the pathogenesis of severe malaria. We studied the
                    phenomenon in 75 patients with mild or moderate forms of acute P. falciparum
                    malaria and found rosetting to occur in 37/75 (50%) of the cases. 20% of healthy
                    adults living in an malaria endemic area of Liberia had anti-rosetting
                    antibodies.</p>
                <p>À strain of stable rosetting phenotype - R+PAl - (Palo Alto, Uganda) was enriched
                    for rosetting on a Ficoll - Isopaque (FIP) and cloned by limiting dilution. This
                    clone was used for investigation of some immunochemical characteristics of the
                    rosetting phenomenon (physical stability, temperature resistance, Ca2+/Mg2+
                    dependency, heparin- and pH sensitivity). We found that antibodies to
                    PfHRP1/KP/KAHRP (a histidine rich protein in the membranes of infected
                    erythrocytes) disrupted rosettes. Anti-PfHRP1 antibodjies gave characteristic

                <p>Giardie lamblia a well known intestinal protozoan parasite, is a frequent cause
                    of both erdemic and epidemic diarrhoeal illness world wide. Despite the
                    ubiquitous nature of G.lamblia very little is known so far about the antigenic
                    orien- tation of this parasite. The present study highlights the biochemical and
                    immunolo- gical nature of plasma membrane antigen(s) and their possible role in
                    immune response.</p>
                <p>Plasma membranes from axenic trophozoites of Giardia lamblia (strain P-1) were
                    isolated and purified. Purity was checked by electron microscopy as well as by
                    marker enzymes study. Under electron microscope the plasma membranes showed
                    smaller fragments and vesicles. The 5' nucleotidase was found to be a superior
                    marker enzyme with an enrichment of about 20 folds in the purified membranes as
                    compared with homogenates.</p>
                <p>The SDS-PAGE analysis and subsequent immunoblotting of plasma membrane antigen(s)
                    against Giardia patient sera showed that the immunoreactive antigens are
                    poly-disperse in nature. However, an immunodominant polypeptide at apparent
                    molecular weight of 118 Kd has been demonstrated in the same experiment. The
                    nature of this polypeptide when subjected to various physico-chemical treatment
                    i.e., heat, pronase and sodium metaperiodate) suggested that the antigen(s) are

                    Toxoplasma proliferated and matured optimally up to 3 days when equal numbers of
                    parasites and HL-60 cells were co-cultured. Toxoplasma duplicated four or five
                    times to form rossettes in the cytoplasm of HL-60 cells and finally lysed the
                    host cells at day 3. But Toxoplasma was phagocytosed and digested
                    intracellularly when challenged to DMSO-treated HL-60 cells. HL-60 and DMSO-
                    treated HL-60 cell membrane proteins were radioiodinated by

                <p>During intraerythrocytic growth of the malaria parasite P. falciparum, proteins
                    elaborated by the parasite are exported to the erythrocyte membrane where they
                    alter the morphological and functional properties of the erythrocyte. We have
                    described the mature-parasite-infected erythrocyte surface antigen (MESA) of P.
                    falciparum, a phosphoprotein of 250-300kDa that varies in size and antigenicity
                    among different parasite isolates and binds tightly to the erythrocyte protein
                    band 4.1. Band 4.1 of infected cells has an increased level of phosphorylation
                    and in erythrocytes infected with some isolates, band 4.1 increases in apparent
                    molecular weight.</p>
                <p>We have isolated genomic clones extending over 5kb that encode the MESA protein.
                    The structure of MESA is reminiscent of other exported malarial proteins that
                    bind to the cytoskeleton such as RESA and the knob protein, in that it has a 2
                    exon structure containing regions of tandem repeat. Sequence differences between
                    the MESA genes of different isolates account for the observed size and

                    interaction and virulence Trophozoites of Giardia lamblia, a human parasite,
                    were lyzed by the polymorpho- nuclear leukocytes (PMNL) of healthy individuals
                    during in vitro interaction.</p>
                <p>However,the parasite damaged the PMNL of giardiasis patients. A prior treatment
                    of Giardia trophozoites with anti-giardia serum, caused agglutination of
                    pathogen and, thereby, the cytotoxic capacity of the parasite was reduced.
                    Interaction of Giardia-trophozoites with peritoneal macrophage, derived from
                    infected mouse, reduced the phagocytic activity of the latter to 43% (against
                    100% in control).</p>
                <p>Macrophage activity was, however, stimulated to 131% when the mice were immunized
                    with giardia antigen prior to experimental infection. Giardial extract proved
                    cyto- toxic at a dose of 0.7 mg, to HeLa cells in tissue culture. These in vitro
                    studies offer experimental evidence of the cytotoxic and immuno-toxic behaviour
                    of G.lamblia towards the host cells.</p>

                    the characterization of protein determinants shared by Schistosoma mansoni and

                    cross-reactive proteins were identified and shown to induce in rabbit and mouse
                    antibodies specific for invertebrate determinants. Ultrastructural
                    immünocytochemistry demonstrated that antibodies to Sm39 essentially bound to
                    muscular structures of parasite and mollusc. Molecular cloning and sequencing of
                    Bg39 indicated the tropomyosin nature of the protein. The mollusc sequence
                    showed a 49 to 67 % homology with eight different tropomyosins from vertebrate
                    and invertebrate species, the highest score of homology being observed with

                <p>Pertubation of the red cell membrane cytoskeleton is a necessary prerequisite for
                    successful penetration of merozoites into the cell. The molecular mechanisms
                    involved remain as yet, undefined. Hereditary pyropoikilocytosis (HPP) describes
                    a relatively rare heterogeneous syndrome in which the red cells of affected
                    individuals have an abnormal spectrin dimer (SpD) self-association resulting in
                    an unstable red cell with altered deformability. Since HPP is, with few
                    exceptions, found exclusively among African populations, we considered whether
                    the condition might represent another red cell polymorphism protecting against
                    the severe effects of falciparum malaria.</p>
                <p>HPP variant red cells with the molecular defect well defined in terms of spectrin
                    mutant and degree of spectrin dimerization, were cultured with synchronised
                    P.falciparum or P.knowlesi schizonts and standard in vitro invasion assays
                    performed using FITC- labelled target cells. Erythrocytes from individuals of 3
                    families with the @1/74 mutant spectrin and 1 family with the «L 1/65 mutant
                    were studied: With P.falciparum, although resistance was never absolute,
                    invasion was significantly reduced to 38%-71% of the invasion observed into
                    normocytes. Conversely P.knowlesi invasion into © 1/65 variant cells was not
                    reduced.</p>
                <p>The results suggest a) reduced invasion possibly as a result of increased
                    spectrin dimers b) different molecular mechanisms involving the red cell
                    cytoskeleton may be involved in penetration of erythrocytes by P.falciparum and
                    P.knowlesi and c) HPP polymorphism may play a role in protection against the

                <p>Les phénomènes impliqués dans la pathogénicité de Giardia intestinalis restent
                    mal connus ; l'effet cytopathogène du parasite sur les entérocytes serait dû à
                    un mécanisme direct et/ou à l'intervention du système immunitaire de l'hôte.
                    L'objectif de cette étude a été d'évaluer la diminution de l'activité des
                    enzymes de la bordure en brosse traduisant l'effet cytopathogène du parasite sur
                    des cellules Caco2 d'origine humaines. Pour cela, les activités saccharase,
                    lactase et phosphatase alcaline présentes dans la bordure en brosse ont été
                    déterminées après 24 H et 48 H de culture en présence de deux inoculums (ratio
                    parasites/cellules = 1/5 et 1/2) de 2 souches de parasite. Les parasites (souche
                    PARIS/88/LCF/8), présents à forte densité, diminuent les activités saccharase et
                    phosphatase alcaline dès 24 H de culture mixte de 21 et2%, respectivement,
                    l'activité lactase n'étant pas modifiée. Aucun effet n'est observé à faible
                    densité (ratio parasite/cellules 1/5), il en est de même pour l'autre souche
                    testée (PARIS/88/LCF/12). Cette étude démontre que l'effet cytopathogène direct
                    des parasites sur les entérocytes est un des mécanismes impliqués dans la
                    pathogénicité de G. intestinalis. Ce modèle est un outil qui nous permet

                    the erythrocyte membranc of newly infected rings. We have recently developed a
                    binding assay using inside out vesicles (IO Vs) from crythrocytes and spent
                    culture supernatants from in vitro cultures of P. falciparum as a source of
                    RESA. Results using this assay.indicated that RESA bound to a component of the
                    membrane skeleton, further experiments identificd crythrocyte spectrin as a
                    major target for RESA binding. Full length cDNA for RESA was inscriced into the
                    plasmid vector pGem containing flanking SP6 and T7 RNA polymerase promotors.
                    Recombinant plasmids were lincarized and RNA transcripts synthesizcd using SP6
                    RNA polymerasc. RNA transcripts were then translatcd in vitro using à wWhcat
                    germ translation system incorporating ””S-mcthionine. Initially we found that a
                    translation product with 320 amino acids delcted from the N-terminal end of the
                    RESA polypeptide still bound to IO Vs. This truncated polypeptide rctaincd both
                    the 5’ and 3° repeat sequences and antisera to epitopes in both these regions of
                    RESA immunoprecipilatcd this translation product. Digestion of this cDNA
                    fragment with Bal-31 was performed to produce a set of RESA cDNAs progressively
                    truncatcd at thcir 3” end. The polypeptides cncoded by threc of the Bal-31
                    fragments were synthesizcd using the SP6 in vitro translation system. As
                    anticipalcd from the scquences of the Bal-31 fragments antisera to the 5°
                    repcats Of RESA rcactcd with all threc polypcptides but antisera Lo the 3°
                    repeats only reactcd with the longest fragment which retained some of the second
                    block of repeats. When these translation products werc incubatcd with IOVS, the
                    two larger fragments bound and became insoluble in Triton X-100, The smallest of
                    the threc polypcptides did not bind to IOVSs and we assume this region of the
                    molecule encodes a domain responsible for the interaction of RESA with spectrin.
                    Further work is now undcrway to identify a minimum amino acid sequence necessary

                    and biochemical characterization of this adhesin, using as genetic controls
                    adhesion- and virulence-deficient mutants. Immunodetection experiments were
                    carried out on thick and thin cryosections of trophozoites. Results showed that
                    the adhesin is located both at the plasmatic and vacuolar membranes of the
                    virulent trophozoites. Interestingly, monospecific polyclonal and monoclonal
                    antibodies reacted poorly with the non-virulent trophozoites. When experiments
                    were carried out after trophozoites ingestion of red blood cells (RBC's) labeled
                    antibodies were localized around RBC's in the cytoplasm of the parasites.
                    Biochemical studies indicated that the 112 kDa adhesin is a glycoprotein and
                    corroborated that it is located in the membrane fraction of trophozoites.</p>

                <p>Malaria - Hepatic phase - Iron.</p>
                <p>Epidemiological and experimental studies have shown that variations in iron
                    status could interfere with the incidence of malaria infection. These studies
                    have so far concerned the erythrocytic phase of malaria. We therefore
                    investigated the role of iron on the hepatic development of Plasmodium yoelii
                    sporozoites in BABL/C mice, in vivo and in vitro Iron overload, obtained by
                    intramuscular injection of 5 mg of iron, results in better penetration and
                    development, in vitro and in vivo, of the sporozoites.</p>
                <p>Blockade of iron metabolism was investigated either by inactivating the xanthine
                    oxydase or by inhibiting heme synthesis. In both cases, in vitro experiments
                    have revealed that iron deficiency induces an inhibition of parasite
                    development.</p>

                <p>Plasmodium falciparum - malaria - cytonadherence - receptors During asexual
                    erythrocytice development, the malaria parasite induces profound changes in the
                    structural and functional properties of the host erythrocyte. We have studied
                    two cytoadherence properties acquired by Pleasmodium falciparum infected
                    erythrocytes, adherence to endothelial cell receptors and a new cytoadherence
                    property, rosetting with uninfected erythrocytes. We have used P. falciparum
                    isolates directly obtained from patients and laboratory adapted parasite lines.
                    In contrast to our earlier studies with human isolates from Sri Lanka, we find
                    that isolates from Africa show a very high degree of variation in their capacity
                    to rosette. After 24-30 h culture in the patients original blood,
                    trophozoiïite-infected cells from only 3 out of 18 isolates were strongly
                    positive for rosetting. The apparent lower frequency of rosetting may reflect
                    phenotypice variation of infected cell-rosetting receptors.</p>
                <p>Alternately this may represent the lack of uninfected cell receptors for
                    rosetting.</p>
                <p>However, infected cells in all parasite isolates bound to endothelial cell
                    receptor, CD38 and Thrombospondin (TSP), and to C32 melanoma cells. Infected
                    cell binding to CD38, TSP and C33 melanoma cells correlated with parasitemia of
                    trophozoïite/schizont infected erythrocytes, and there was a very high
                    correlation between binding to CD38 and TSP (r=0.98). These results suggest that
                    infected cell surface receptors for binding to CD38, TSP and C32 melanoma cells
                    may be the same or co-expressed, but different from the receptors for rosetting
                    with uninfected cells.</p>
                <p>Studies using parasites of the Malayan Camp (MC) strain show that receptors for
                    these two cytoadherence properties can be co-expressed. Parasites of MC strain
                    that exhibit high rosetting (R+) in vitro but do not bind to C33 melanoma cells.
                    However, when rosettes are mechanically disrupted and infected erythrocytes are
                    purified from uninfected cells, they bind strongly to C323 cells and CD38.
                    Rheological and hemodynamic studies in an ex vivo rat mesoappendix preparation
                    show that perfusion of highly rosetting R+ parasitised red cell (PRBC) (A)
                    obstruct post-capillary venules as PRBC/RBC rosettes but PRBC do not directly
                    attach to the vascular endothelium. (B) in the presence of anti-rosetting
                    antibodies and heparin which reverse rosetting PRBC directly adhere to the
                    endothelium and cause obstruction. We propose that phenotypic diversity in wild
                    isolates and difference in blood vessel obstruction caused by rosetting and non-
                    rosetting parasites may relate to the pathology of clinical malaria.</p>

                <p>Schistosome larva?, snail, susceptibility/resistance Agglutinins are
                    glycoproteins that might function as recognition facors of nonself in
                    invertebrates. They are proposed mediators of parasite larval killing by
                    haemocytes in non-susceptible trematode snail combinations. We have identified
                    and isolated by FPLC a potent haemagglutinin from the haemolymph of Bulinus
                    nasutus, a vector of Schistosoma haematobium. This protein binds to the surface
                    of miracidia of the incompatible parasite S. margrebowiei. On SDS PAGE under
                    reducing conditions this agglutinin has an apparent Mr of 135k.</p>
                <p>We have isolated glycoproteins of similar Mr from the haemolymph of other Bulinus
                    species, although these do not share identical haemagglutinating activity.
                    Antisera raised in Balb-C mice against this panel of Mr 135k haemolymph proteins
                    show cross reactivity. The role of these proteins in the
                    susceptibility/resistance of Bulinus species to Schistosoma infection will be
                    postulated.</p>

                <p>Acanthocephala - Crustacea - Behavior - Serotonin - Screening pigment Some larval
                    helminths alter the behavior of their invertebrate intermediate hosts by
                    changing the responses of the hosts to environmental stimuli. P. paradoxus
                    induces in its intermediate host G. lacustris a shift in habitat towards zones
                    of higher illumination and an altered escape response. Infected gammarids escape
                    towards a light source, skim the surface, then cling firmly to any material and
                    remain immobile in a flexed posture from minutes to hours. Uninfected gammarids
                    escape away from a light source and do not cling (Bethel W.M. and Holmes J.C.,
                    J. Parasitol. 59:945, 1973).</p>
                <p>The flexed posture of clinging infected gammarids was reminiscent of the flexed
                    posture of lobsters injected with the biogenic amine serotonin (Livingstone MS.
                    et al., Science, 208: 76, 1980); therefore, the effects of injected amines on
                    the behavior of gammarids were tested. Uninfected gammarids injected with
                    serotonin {1 to 20 ug/50 mg) (but not other biogenic amines or GABA), also
                    responded to mechanical stimulation by clinging. In addition, serotonin elicited
                    in uninfected gammarids a skimming behavior, and a photopositive behavior in the
                    hour following treatment. Octopamine (5, 10 ug) antagonized the clinging
                    response but not the photopositivity of infected gammarids.</p>
                <p>Histological sections did not reveal any qualitative difference between the eyes
                    of infected and uninfected gammarids. However, the accessory screening pigment
                    was, on average, more light adapted in infected gammarids than in uninfected
                    ones. The increased photopositivity induced by serotonin was not accompanied by
                    a migration of the accessory screening pigment.</p>
                <p>The results are interpreted as follows. Serotonin may modulate the different
                    components of the altered escape behavior in the central nervous system of
                    infected gammarids; that is, the transient directional response to light, and
                    the skimming and clinging behaviors. The position of the accessory screening
                    pigment may mediate the persistent graded response to light (i.e., the light
                    preferendum), and hence participate in the habitat shift of infected gammarids.

                    for the detection of circulating cysticercal antigen in human cerebrospinal
                    fluid (CSF), using immuno- glooulin fraction of anticysticercal polyclonal serum
                    raised in rabbits. The sensitivity levels of 2 ng/ml was achieved by both
                    T-ELISA and C-DIA using avidin-biotin system and 45 ng/ml for RPHA. All the
                    three tests were found to be equally specific. Circulating cysticercal antigens
                    were demonstraple in CSF of confirmed neurocysticercosis (NCC) to the tune of
                    91.6% by T-ELISA, 83% by C-DIA and 75% by RPHA. These immunoassay proved
                    valuable for the detec- tion of cysticercal antigens in CSF samples with a high
                    degree of specificity in the diagnosis of neurocysticercosis.</p>
                <p>On characterization of these circulating cysticercal antigens immunologically,

                    addition to few other components in some of the cases. The accuracy of diagnosis
                    of NCC could be increased by detecting these characterized specific antigens in

                    lyse du parasite. Afin d'évaluer le rôle des composants du milieu de culture et
                    de la présence de cellules-cibles sur les sécrétions du toxoplasme, ont été
                    comparés les Ag obtenus après 1 h d'incubation dans du sérum physiologique, seul
                    ou additionné de substitut de sérum (utilisé pour la culture des cellules) et
                    dans du M.E.M. sans substitut sur des cellules préalablement rincées et incubées
                    1 à 2 h dans du M.E.M.</p>
                <p>Dans ces conditions, après 1 h de culture, alors que de nombreux parasites ont
                    envahi les fibroblastes, aucun Ag n'est décelable dans le surnageant.</p>
                <p>Par contre, le substitut de sérum provoque la sécrétion de nombreux Ag même pour
                    des temps d'incubation très court (1/4 h). Des souris immunisées avec ces Ag

                    développent des anticorps anti-membranaires.</p>
                <p>Ainsi, le phénomène de sécrétion (ou excrétion) des trophozoïtes ne paraît pas
                    lié au mécanisme d'invasion. La nécessité de la présence de composés sériques
                    pourrait indiquer qu'il s'agit d'un mécanisme de défense face à un milieu
                    hostile. Ces Ag pourraient servir de "leurres" pour le système immunitaire lors
                    de la phase proliférative de l'infection.</p>

                    Hatschekia, Plectropomus The gills of anaesthetised coral trout Plectropomus
                    leopardus infested with the siphonostome copepod Hatschekia plectropomi were
                    perfused with a plasma substitute followed by either, glutaraldehyde fixative,
                    or a Microfil silicon elastomer, or Mercox liquid acrylic plastic. A fourth fish
                    was injected i.v. with fluoroscein-tagged albumen, killed after 19 min, and gill
                    tissues fixed in neutral formalin. Other infected gills were immersion fixed in
                    formalin. Conventional histology and scanning electron microscopy of parasitised
                    gill filaments revealed that about 6 lamellae beneath the copepod's
                    cephalothorax were obliterated, 3 lamellae on either side were flattened and
                    fused at their tips, and 6 lamellae on the contralateral side were destroyed or
                    distorted, suggesting a functional loss of about 18 lamellae per parasite. The
                    results from perfused gills showed that the circulation was impaired to at least
                    twice this number, particularly proximally along the gill filament. Lysed tissue
                    and inflammatory cells were evident at the feeding site of the parasite. It is
                    likely that vasoactive substances diffusing from the feeding site cause the
                    reduced blood flow in nearby lamellae that otherwise appear normal.</p>

                    privilégié pour l'étude de différents paramètres susceptibles d'intervenir dans
                    l'adhérence du parasite. Aucune modification significative de la fixation aux
                    cellules en culture n'a été observée après trypsination préalable des
                    trophozoïtes, à température ambiante et à 37° C. Le rôle de certaines lectines
                    membranaires de Giardia intestinalis a été étudié à travers des études
                    d'inhibition de l'adhérence par des oses (ou osides) ; nous avons constaté une
                    diminution des pourcentages d'adhérence des trophozoïtes aux cellules Caco2 en
                    présence de mannose 6-phosphate (-14 %) et de glucose 100 uM (-23 %). Les effets

                    du cytosquelette et en particulier des microtubules, qui semblent être les
                    effecteurs principaux de la fixation du parasite. Les mécanismes d'adhérence de
                    G. intestinalis à des cellules de type entérocytaire en culture semblent donc
                    être essentiellement de nature mécanique ou hydrodynamique, mais certaines

                <p>malaria, lipids, erythrocyte, Plasmodium falciparum The membrane lipid
                    composition of normal human erythrocytes and those infected with the human
                    malaria Plasmodium falciparum was studied using host cell membranes separated
                    from parasite membranes using the Affigel (731) bead method. The purity of the
                    membrane preparation was estimated to be &gt;98% as determined by the activity
                    of the parasite membrane-specific enzyme, choline phosphotransferase. No
                    difference was found in the content of phosphatidylethanoïamine (PE) and only
                    small changes were observed for phosphatidylcholine (PC) and phosphatidylserine
                    (PS). The sphingomyelin content in red cell membranes of both trophozoite- and
                    schizont-infected cells was up to 47% less than that of uninfected cells, and
                    the cholesterol/phospholipid ratio was decreased 55%. Trophozoite- and
                    schizont-infected cells exchanged 29 and 33% less cholesterol, respectively,
                    than uninfected cells. Using phospholipase A, and Sphingomyelinase digestion
                    followed by membrane isolation and phospholipid analysis we detected
                    perturbation of both PC and PE asymmetry as well as a developmentally related
                    appearance of PS in the outer leaflet. These changes in lipid composition and
                    cholesterol exchange could have a marked effect on the function of the red cell
                    membrane of malaria-infected cells and may be responsible, in part, for the
                    increased fluidity and permeability of P. falciparum-infected erythrocytes.</p>

                <p>Entamoeba histolytica adhesins were detected by the gerreration of monoclonal
                    antibodies (MAbs) inhibitors of adhesion. In other experiments trophozoites were
                    radiolabeled and incubated with red blood cells (RBC's) or epithelial MDCK
                    cells. Labeled amebic proteins of 210, 160, 112, 90, 70, 50 and 24 kDa were
                    detected adhered on target cells. Iodinated MDCK proteins formed ligand-receptor
                    complexes with amebic proteins of 112 kDa, 90 and 48 to 50 kDa, when incubated
                    with amebic proteins separated by gel electrophoresis. When RBC's interacted
                    with adherence-deficient mutants, used in this work as highly negative genetic
                    controls, proteins of 112 and 90 kDa appeared diminished on RBC surface, in
                    comparison with wild type strain. The 112 KkDa adhesin was not detected in a
                    monoxenic nonpathogenic E. histolytica strain, isolated from an asymptomatic
                    carrier. An E. histolytica DNA library was constructed in lambda gt-11, and
                    recombinant clones were selected using polyclonal antibodies against the 112 kDa
                    adhesin. In spite of the fact that DNA of the parasite was clonred, production
                    of the hybrid protein in Escherichia coli was relatively efficient. Correlation
                    of the presence of adhesins with the virulence of E. histolytica trophozoites
                    encourage us to propose these proteins and their antibodies as good candidates
                    in the design of reliable and unexpensive diagnosis and vaccine methods.</p>

                <p>African trypanosomes - human serum resistant - variant antigenic type.</p>
                <p>For the African trypanosomes, it has been observed that, in the absence of any
                    immunological pressure, the change from a human serum sensitive (HsS) phenotype
                    to a human serum resistant (HSR) one is always accompanied by a change in the
                    variant antigenic type (VAT). In four different experiments; treatment of a HsS
                    clone with normal human serum (NHS), either in vitro or in immunosuppressed
                    mice: led to a HsR phenotype and a predictable change in VAT. In addition, when
                    NHS pressure was elimminated;, HSR was eventually lost, and the VAT changed back
                    to the original parental VAT. Diagrammatically: HsS/VAT, &lt;É HSR/VAT à ol
                    HsS/VAT, . These changes in VAT were monitored both serolagically and by 1- and
                    2-D PAGE. Based upon these experiments we sugggest that VAT or VAT-associated
                    proteins are involved in NHS sensitivity. At least two possible mechanisms could
                    explain this phenomenom: (1) that a set of specific VAT genes is associated with
                    NHS resistance, and (2) that, after NHS treatment, a variety of HsR-VATS
                    actually survive, but only one becomes dominant.</p>

                    entre la fibronectine (Fn) et les récepteurs parasitaires est que certains
                    fragments de la Fn, obtenus après un clivage protéolytique par la cathepsine D,
                    induisent une différenciation morphologique rapide des trypomastigotes en
                    "sphéromastigotes". Cette stimulation s'accompagne d'une augmentation de la
                    concentration intracellulaire d'AMP cyclique, d'une synthèse accrue de protéines
                    et de leur phosphorylation. Ces observations sont en faveur de la notion d'un
                    rôle physiologique de la dégradation de la Fn et de l'hypothèse que cette
                    dégradation aboutit à la formation de “peptides d'activation" qui ont des

                    Tronche,France P. falciparum - TNF - Soluble factor Malaria pathogeny depends in
                    part on the multiplication of the parasite and in part on some elements of the
                    immunological response. One of these elements, Tumor Necrosis Factor, is of
                    potential relevance to the pathogenesis of cerebral malaria. It has been
                    demonstrated that TNF increase cytoadherence of parasitized erytrocytes to
                    endothelial cells of brain capillaries, and that TNF levels in sera are strongly
                    correlated to a fatal outcome. In vitro, we demonstrated that P. falciparum is
                    able to induce the secre- tion of TNF by human non primed macrophages, and that
                    this secretion is mediated by a heat stable soluble factor. By using mouse
                    polyclonal antibodies raised against human serum free P. falciparum culture
                    supernatant, we investigated the possibility of blocking this TNF secretion.
                    Better knowledge concerning that heat stable soluble factor could allow us to
                    prevent cerebral malaria by inhibiting TNF production. This kind of anti-
                    disease vaccine will avoid problems of antigenic polymorphism.</p>

                    celi cultures (TR.0 forms) or treated with trypsin (TR.TO forms) can infect
                    fibroblastic cells onty to a limited extent.</p>
                <p>However. extraceliular ‘maturation’ of these parasitic forms for 20 h and 4 h
                    (which gives rise to the TR.20 and TRT4 forms, respectively) and their treatment
                    with sialogtycoproteins (SGP) increases infectivity several-fold. In order to
                    explore the mechanism of this SGP stimulation, we have now sompared the changes
                    of infectivity and radioactivity which occur upon exposure of these parasitic
                    forms to a SGP like fetuin (FET). Using double {abelied FET with 1251 in the
                    protein moiety and 3H in the sialyl groups, we have found that ali forms (TR.0,
                    TR.TO, TR.20, and TR.T4) bind very rapidly 149-180 ng FET/108 parasites,
                    reaching 60-100% higher values upon incubation for 30 min at 37°C. Only TR.O0
                    showsa significant, selective incorporation of 3H, indicating that the increase
                    of infectivity taking place upon maturation" of TR.0 and TR.TO into the
                    corresponding TR.20 and TR.T4 forms, is not accompanied by a higher 3H/1251I
                    ratio in the latter forms. Incubation of TRTO in the presence of FET and
                    tunicamycin does not result in an elevated infectivity. Treatment of TR.TO with
                    FET, followed by a 4 hr incubation, increases infectivity as effectively as
                    incubation first, followed by FET treatment. If anti-FET immune serum is used in
                    these experiments, it blocks the stimulation of infectivity onty if it present
                    after FET treatment and before parasite ‘maturation by incubation. The results
                    obtained âre compatible with the hypothesis that FET, after acting as a sialyi
                    donor, remains bound to the parasite, and a tunicamycin- sensitive Z cruz
                    component, which becomes available upon parasite ‘maturation’, is siatylated by
                    the bound FET, thus bringing about expression of infectivity. (Research

                <p>Nematode - Epicuticle - Fluoresence - Lipid - Development The basic biology and
                    biochemistry of infection should be understood since modifications undergone by
                    the parasite during the infection process might provide targets for chemo- or
                    immunotherapy. Fluoresence-based techniques (including fluorescence recovery
                    after photobleaching (FRAP)), using fluorescent lipid probes, have been used to
                    determine the nature of the biophysical changes in the epicuticle which we have
                    observed in infective larvae of Acanthocheilonema _viteae, Nippostrongylus
                    brasiliensis, Trichinella spiralis and unsheathed Ostertagia ostertagi. These
                    larvae were found to exhibit a rapid affinity for the insertion of
                    5-N-octadecylaminofluorecein (AF18) upon exposure to possible infection stimuli,
                    whereas before stimulation in the ‘pre-parasitic' state, they had no affinity
                    for this probe. For example, AF18 insertion occurs for L3's of A, viteae in RPMI
                    1640 at 37°C. This effect appears to be due to synergism between increased
                    temperature (27°C to 37°C) and exposure to new medium (Grace's insect medium to
                    RPMI 1640), as temperature elevation or medium change alone have only slight
                    effects on lipophilicity and do not approach the degree of change seen with
                    both. Potential infection stimuli include increased Na*ions, increased pH and
                    temperature elevation since these were also found to cause insertion of AF18. We
                    conclude that developmental changes associated with infection require the
                    modification of the biophysical properties of the epicuticle.</p>

                <p>Plasmodium infected erythrocytes have shown biochemical modifications on their

                    P. falciparum infected erythrocytes of Aotus monkeys and P. falciparum infected
                    human erythrocytes from in vitro culture.</p>
                <p>In the present work, agglutination method with lectins using human erythrocytes
                    infected with P. falciparum was applied: Isolates were directly obtained from
                    naturally infected patients from Bolivar State, Venezuela.</p>
                <p>Short cultures of the blood are carried out in order to obtain maturation of
                    parasites looking forward mature trophozoiïites and schizonts. Enrichment of
                    infected erythrocytes of the sample is obtained by sedimentation in gelatin,
                    then fixed with glutaraldehide 0,25% for 1 hour. Some samples were treated with
                    tripsin 1 mg/ml for 1 hour. The lectins used were Concanavalin À (Con-A),
                    soybean lectin (SBA), wheat germen (WGA) and ricino lectin (RCA).</p>
                <p>The results obtained from 13 samples point out an increase in the agglutination
                    with Con A and partially with SBA. Tripsin-treatment improves the response to
                    SBA and more agglutination is seen with WGA and RCA in comparison with normal
                    human erythrocytes with the same treatment.</p>

                <p>cruzi trypomastigotes previously treated with a monoclonal antibody specific for
                    a surface component. Microscopic examination revealed that these antibodies
                    significantly enhanced the infective capacity of the parasite. However, a
                    similar effect was produced when nonspecific monoclonal antibodies or
                    immunoglobulins of IgGi subclass were used, suggesting that the Fc portion of
                    the immunoglobulins could be the relevant moiety.</p>
                <p>Indeed, purified Fc fragment from human IgG stimulated the infective capacity of

                <p>The present results indicate that trypomastigote Fc receptors may regulate the

                    endocytobionts in fat body bacteriocytes and in oocytes. During a coevo-
                    lutionary process, the prokaryotic symbiont and the host became so
                    interdependent that they are not allowed to have a separated life. Endosymbionts
                    are transmitted transovarial- ly, so that the embryo obtains a further
                    hereditary equipment given by bacteria.</p>
                <p>In this work, using light and electron microscopy and freeze-fracture techniques,
                    we could describe the main steps of the symbiont cycle in Blattella
                    germanica.</p>
                <p>The symbiotic bacteria, during development of the embryonic fat body, leave the
                    yolk sac and are released into the epineural sinus, before the entoblastema has
                    formed. At this time, in the same region a large amount of cells having the
                    characters of prohemocytes, freshly differentiated from the mesoblastic strips,
                    is present. Later on these cells e- volve in the plasmatocyte model, being able
                    of endocytic and amoeboid functions. Clusters of symbionts move around
                    plasmatocytes, which surround the fat body cells. Afterwards, these
                    symbionts-filled cells glide between the fat body cells and undergo conspicuous
                    structural modifications. The cells lose the amoeboid shape and become oval,
                    with an ec- centric nucleus and a large amount of cytoplasm, originating the
                    bacteriocytes. Towards the end of the embryonic development, the bacteriocytes
                    divide into two groups: one group remains in the fat body, while the other
                    migrates into the ovary. À few bacteriocytes first surround the ovary, then
                    glide between the ovarioles, when nymphs are 5 days old.</p>
                <p>Further, the intraovaric bacteriocytes release the bacteria which, after passing
                    through the basal membrane and the follicular epithelium, come into contact with
                    the oocyte mem- brane, where they are enveloped by a thick network of
                    microvilli. Before chorion has for- med, the symbionts are actively taken in the
                    oocyte membrane by endocytosis.</p>

                    by flagellum, anterior and posterior and lateral regions of the cell body. When
                    the HMC was incubated with RCA lectin-ferritin prior to infection with T. cruzi,
                    the ultrastructural analysis revealed migration of the galactosyl receptors to
                    the adhesion region of parasite, with concentration of ferritin particles. These
                    particles were absent in the neighbourhood of attaachment's site of T. cruzi but

                    tick-borne, protozoan parasite, Theileria parva causes an acute and often fatal
                    disease in cattle known as East Coast fever. The infective forms of the
                    parasite, tick-derived sporozoites, invade a subpopulation of bovine lymphoid
                    cells in which they differentiate to the schizont stage. We have studied in
                    detail at the EM level, the process of sporozoite entry into susceptible
                    lymphocytes and have begun to identify the molecular interactions involved in
                    the process. Our results show that the entry process involves a defined series
                    of events and that while the initial sporozoite-lymphocyte interaction can occur
                    at 0-20C, all subsequent stages are temperative-dependent, require the
                    participation of live intact sporozoites and host cells, and involve some
                    rearrangement of the host cell surface membrane or cytoskeleton.</p>
                <p>Sporozoite entry can be inhibited by antibodies reactive with MHC Class I
                    molecules, whereas Mabs reactive with the bovine equivalent of CD45, and a
                    number of other non-MHC lymphocyte surface molecules have no effect.
                    Furthermore, T.parva sporozoites cannot bind to or enter a transformed bovine
                    cell line selected for low MHC Class I expression following deletion
                    mutagenesis, whereas they readily enter the parent cell line. These results
                    indicate that MHC Class I molecules play an essential role in the process of
                    T.parva sporozoite entry into bovine lymphocytes.</p>

                    transmission blocking monoclonal antibody (mAb IID2-C5), which is directed
                    against an epidermal growth factor (EGF)-like protein on the ookinete surface,
                    blocks the development of P. gallinaceum to oocysts (Infect. Immun., 45,
                    775-777, 1984). In this study we investigated the stage at which mAb IID2-C5
                    blocks parasite development to oocysts. The invasion kinetics of parasites in
                    midguts, fed in the presence of mAb, was compared with controls. Invasion in the
                    presence of mAb was shown to be drastically reduced. In light microscopic and EM
                    sections of midguts, fed in the presence of IID2-C5 ookinetes accumulated on the
                    peritrophic membrane. In controls invaded ookinetes and oocysts were found in
                    addition in epithelial cells. No accumulation occurred between peritrophic
                    membrane and epithelium in mAb-fed mosquitoes, indicating that the block was at
                    the peritrophic membrane and not at the microvilli. Furthermore, feeding studies
                    with ookinetes in the presence of mAb are consistent with the idea that the mAb
                    has no effect on invasion of epithelial cells.</p>

                <p>Host cell invasion in the apicomplexa is a complex event involvinz attatchnent,
                    formation of an intimate junction between host and parasite membranes and
                    translocation of this junction to propel the parasite into the newly formed
                    parasitophorous vacuole. Evidence suggests that invasion is an active parasite
                    directed process, however, the role of the host cell remains poorly understood.
                    We have examined the relevance of the host cell cytoskeleton to invasion.
                    Colcemid dependant destruction of the microtubular network in MDBK cells caused
                    a significant reduction in invasion. The time course of microtubule
                    repolymerisation following removal of Colcemid correlated with the return to
                    control invasion rates.</p>

                    their on- togenetic stage and species (T. spiralis and T. pseudospiralis) was
                    stu- died. Mice of C57BL/6 strain were infected per os with 300 T. spiralis or
                    500 T. pseudospiralis larvae. À suspension of melanoma B1l6 cells was inoculated
                    s.c. in the dorsal region. On day 18 post inoculation the weight of a tumor was
                    assessed. The trichinellous process significantly inhibited the tumour growth
                    when inoculated during the intestinal phase (on day 7 p.i.) and during the
                    muscle phase (on day 25 p.i.). The growth of the tumour was.not affected by a
                    simultaneous inoculation of melanoma B16 with trichinellae. An increase of the
                    inhibitory offect on the tumour growth was reached by killing the larvae in the
                    intestinal phase (luxa- bendazole 100 mg/kg). A similar effect was observed with
                    a double re- infection and killing of larvae. T. pseudospiralis inhibited the
                    growth of melanoma B16 more impressively than T. spiralis.</p>

                    Plasmodium falciparum - Western-blotting - Antibodies - Epidemiology À
                    longitudinal study was carried out in Burkina Faso to investigate the natural
                    develop- ment of immune response to P.falciparum malaria. Three bleedings were
                    effectuated before, during and after the seasonal peak of transmission. Detailed
                    antigens mappings and antibody prevalences of the 248 collected sera were
                    established by immuno-blotting according to several epidemiological and
                    biological parameters. An improved western- blotting system was used to analyse
                    up to 67 sera on each nitrocellulose sheet, which allowed us to perform the
                    whole study in strictly comparable conditions. Two different blood stage
                    antigens (exo and somatic antigens) were used to analyse the distribution of
                    diverse classes and subclasses of immunoglobulins, according to the age of the
                    indivi- duals, the detection or not of a malarial attack, the transmission
                    period, the origin of parasite isolates and the response level to
                    intraerythrocytic stages. This emphasis a strong individual variation, but two
                    major antigens of 115, 103 kDa were particularly present. They induced high
                    antibodies titers and prevalences, but are probably not involved with
                    protection. The antibodies detected in sera of cohort, presumed to be protected,
                    were correlated to each putative protective antigens : 170, 129, 124, 42 kDa
                    exo-Ag and 221, 126, 84, 67, 46 kDa somatic Ag. Prevalences of IgG antibodies
                    were different according to the studied isotype. Most of antigens stimulating
                    IgG production were also responsible for IgM antibody response.The role played
                    by these antibodies in the development of natural immunity against malaria is

                <p>Soluble, heat-stable proteins of P. falciparum known as S-antigens provide useful
                    markers for serotyping the asexual blood-stages of P. falciparum. Although
                    individual S-antigens have a world-wide distribution, we found in a previous
                    study in Papua New Guinea that the prevalence of one particular S-antigen (FC27)
                    varied among villages at one point in time as well as within a village over
                    time.</p>
                <p>More S-antigen reagents are now available and with these we have examined
                    parasite diversity and antibody responses to S-antigens in one village (Panim)
                    in the Madang region of Papua New Guinea. With antisera raised to cloned
                    S-antigens we identified 3 different serc- types of P. falciparum (FC27, K1 and
                    V1) simultaneously causing infections in the village. At least two other
                    S-antigen serotypes were identified in Panim with a serum obtained from an adult
                    Papua New Guinean. Of the 22 individuals in which S-antigens were detected 20
                    were parasitaemic; S-antigens were detected in 20 of 79 parasitaemic individuals
                    but in only 2 of 120 non-parasitaemic individuals. S-antigens were detected in
                    the majority of individuals with particularly high parasitaemias but in no
                    individual was more than one S-antigen detected.</p>
                <p>Our previous study indicated that endemic malaria is characterized by epidemics
                    of parasites of different S-antigen serotype. The results of the Panim study are
                    consistent with this conclusion in that the Wellcome/Palo Alto S-antigen
                    serotype was not detected although this serotype has been found in the Madang
                    region previously. S-antigenaemia was more prevalent in children whereas
                    antibodies to S-antigens were more prevalent in adults. Approximately 50% of
                    adults had antibodies to at least one of the four S-antigens studied. À major
                    determinant of stable S-antigen seropositivity may be experience of multiple
                    infections of varying serotype over many years.</p>

                    cells to lie between the basal end and the basal lamina. Some researchers
                    observed that ookinetes pass through the epithelial cells; others observed
                    movement between the cells. We studied the migration of P. gallinaceum ookinetes
                    through the midgut epithelium in Aedes aegypti by transmission electron
                    microscopy. Ookinetes in the midgut epithelial cells were observed mostly
                    beneath the microvilli, and were surrounded by a parasitophorous vacuole
                    membrane. Other ookinetes were situated extracellularly between cytoplasmic
                    membranes of adjacent midgut epithelial cells or were attached to the midgut
                    basal lamina. These findings suggest that ookinetes invade the midgut epithelial
                    cells, become surrounded by a parasitophorous vacuole membrane, and then move to
                    the intercellular space. They subsequently take an intercellular route to reach
                    the basal lamina of the midgut epithellum.</p>

                <p>Malaria - Merozoites - Parasitophorous membrane Many pathogenic protozoa develop
                    only within another living host cell. What is the nature of this dependence? One
                    approach to this problem is to attempt to replace the intact host cell with an
                    environment in which the parasite will develop extracellularly.</p>
                <p>Such initial extracellular development has been obtained with the erythrocytic 6
                    merozoites of Plasmodium falciparum. When these are inoculated (at about 25 x 10
                    /ml) into a sonicated erythrocyte extract supplemented with ATP (2mM) and
                    pyruvate (5mM) and incubated in 3% CO,, 16% O, at 37°, up to 20% of the
                    organisms develop into early trophic forms as count&amp;éd in Giémsa-stained
                    films. Their viability is shown by their uptake of Rhodamine 123. Whereas most
                    of the forms seen by rhodamine fluorescence appear as small round bodies, some
                    of them are larger and often ring shaped. A few of these are gently motile; on
                    occasion a tiny pigment grain can be seen. Electron micrographs show forms
                    larger than merozoites with a plasma membrane, a nucleus, and abundant
                    ribosomes. They lack rhoptries and the inner membranes characteristic of
                    merozoites. They resemble early rings of similar age allowed to develop within
                    red cells and then lysed out. The one notable difference is that the latter have
                    a parasitophorous membrane closely apposed around the plasma membrane, whereas
                    the extracellular forms have only their single plasma membrane. These results
                    show that the parasitophorous membrane is not essential for early trophic
                    development.</p>

                    parasite FN receptor levels were studied using specific ELISA or RIA, in the
                    pooled samples of infected of control mice.</p>
                <p>FN levels increased between the 5th and the 7th week of infection, i.e. on the
                    end of the acute phase of the disease, when parasitemia was decreasing. After
                    this date, FN levels were similar in infected and control mice.</p>
                <p>Antibody to FN appeared on the 4th week of infection and reached its maximum
                    level on the 6th post-infection week,which remained nearly stable until the end

                <p>This evolution was similar to that of the specific (T.cruzi antibodies) and

                    for a 85 Kd FN binding protein from T.cruzi, was also detectable during the 4th
                    week of in- fection, when parasitemia was decreasïing. Then, it peaked between
                    the 5th and the 8th post-infection week, before to stay at lower levels until
                    the end of the infection course.</p>
                <p>Such results show that FN likely play an important role in vivo, in the
                    host-parasite interaction. They are in agreement with the previous in vitro

                <p>Human hepatocytes - in vitro invasion - Plasmodium falciparum In this study ve
                    have compared primary cultures of human hepatocytes CHH) with the human
                    hepatoblastoma cell line HepG2-A16 (Hep) for use in an in vitro sporozoite
                    invasion assay . We want to use this assay for the study of the
                    sporozoite-hepatocyte interaction.</p>
                <p>The invasion assay was based on the Inhibition of Sporozoite Invasion (ISI) assay
                    as described by Hollingdale et al (J. Immunol, (1984) 132: 909). To determine
                    whether culture conditions of the HH and/or Hep cells is of influence on the on
                    the penetration rate of P.falciparum sporozoi- tes medium components such as :
                    Dexamethason, antibiotics , fetal calf serum (FCS) or albumin and Calcium were
                    tested.</p>
                <p>We have shown that Hep cells differ from HH because they lack one of the putative
                    sporozoite receptor molecules (55 kD :J.van Pelt et al submit- ted) . We studied
                    the penetration of sporozoites into HH and Hep cells when incubated together
                    with different membrane protein fractions from human or rat liver. Both the 20
                    kD and 55 kD HH proteins blocked invasi- on in HH and Hep cells. A 40 kD protein
                    from HH or rat hepatocyte membrane proteins did not block invasion.Antibodies to
                    the HH 55 kD protein reduces the penetration of sporozoites into HH (40 %) but
                    not into Hep cells (100 %).</p>
                <p>We have used human serum and IgG-fractions in this ISI assay. There vere

                <p>Sporozoites - P. falciparum - Hepatocytes - Chloroquine - C-reactive protein The
                    assay for inhibition of sporozoite invasion (ISI) in hepatoma cells or primary
                    human hepatocytes has been designed for the detection of anti-sporozoite
                    antibodies. It vas supposed to be a test for functionality of antibodies (i1.e.
                    their protective properties).</p>
                <p>Ag sauch the ISI has been used for screening of sera from endemic areas and
                    indeed, ve have found that sera from adults in a highly edemic area (Burkina
                    Faso) all inhibit the penetration of sporozoites for more than 70%. All sera had
                    sporozoite antibodies as measured in an ELISA with CS antigen R32tet32.</p>
                <p>Hovever, people from endemic areas may use chloroquine to cure fever (supposedlÿ
                    malaria). We have found that Europeans who used chloroquine prophylaxis and
                    being negative for antibodies, do inhibit the penetration of sporozoites into
                    hepatoma cells.</p>
                <p>This effect vas confirmed by incubating such cells with various amounte of
                    chloroquine before the addition of sporozoites. It appears that chloroquine has
                    an inhibiting effect on penetration.</p>
                <p>Furthermore, experimental studies in rats ghoved that P. berghei-sporozoites
                    injected during parasitaemias, largely failed to infect hepatocytes. Changes
                    caused by infection (fever, cytokines, acute-phase proteins) might thus have an
                    influence on penetration. We have tested sera from influenza patients, which
                    contained C-reactive protein and sera after healing (vithout this protein) in
                    the ISI-test. À clear reduction vas observed in all "fever" sera, containing
                    C-reactive protein.</p>
                <p>These aspects make the test unsuitable for application of sera from endemic
                    areas, which may contain antibodies, chloroquine and or cytokines and
                    acute-phase proteins, all of which may interfere with sporozoite
                    penetration.</p>

                <p>Monoclonal antibodies have been developed and used as specific probe to locate
                    and identify a 29 KD cytotoxic molecule of axenic Enta- moeba histolytica
                    trophozoites. Monoclonal antibody produced by clone C8 (MoAb C8) strongly
                    agglutinated the amoebic trophozoites. The imnmuno- fluorescence of live E.
                    histolytica trophozoites and only surface fluorescence of acetone fixed
                    trophozoites by MoAb C8 indicated existence of 29 KD molecule on surface
                    associated plasma membrane of E.histolytica.</p>
                <p>This monoclonal antibody belonged to IgG, isotype. The prior treatment of E.
                    histolytica trophozoites with MoAb La resulted in significant
                    reduction(P&lt;0.01) in adherence of E, histolytica trophozoites to cultured
                    Chinese Hamster Ovary cells and also significant reduction (P&lt;0.01) in
                    cytotoxicity to cultured Baby Hamster kidney cell monolayers. Pretreat- ment of
                    amoebic trophozoites with MoAb C8 prior to cultivation in TPS-I medium resulted
                    in significant reduction (P&lt;0.01) in growth of tropho- zoites. The 29 KD
                    molecule was also recognised by all 15 sera from patients of cured amoebic liver
                    abscess. The data, thus, suggested that surface exposed 29 KD molecule is one of
                    the receptor molecules involved in E. histolytica-host cell interaction and may
                    possibly modulate amoebic disease process.</p>

                <p>First, we have shown that the macronharne hybridoma cells can serve as host cell
                    for the narasite: when increasina narasite/ce1ll ratios were used from 3/1 to

                    lectin Tritrichomonas mobilensis, an enteric parasite of squirrel monkeys, was
                    first reported by this laboratory. Two strains were isolated with dif- ferences
                    in adherence characteristics. Strain 776(ATCC:50011) demon- strated tenacious
                    attachment to tissue culture monolayers in contrast to strain 4190(ATCC:40597)
                    which did not. Cloned isolates of these strains have been examined for adherence
                    and hemolysis of human erythrocytes as an experimental model of pathogenicity.
                    The presence of sialic acid binding lectin activity has been demonstrated in
                    clones 4190-5D and 776- 5A analogous to that obtained from the parent strains.
                    An additional clone of strain 776, designated 776-7C, did not exhibit
                    hemagglutination (HA) activity using an identical lectin purification procedure.
                    Whole organism hemolysis assay conducted with these three strains resulted in
                    erythrocyte lysis by clones 4190-5D and 776-5A but not by 776-7C. Lysis was also
                    inhibited by N-acetylneuraminic acid. These preliminary data link lectin
                    activity with cell lysis as part of a growing body of evi- dence in favor of
                    microbial "lectin-lysin" pairs. Additional biochemical studies on adhesins and
                    cell lysis in these three clones should clarify the role of these processes in

                    lectin has been isolated from Tritrichomonas mobilensis strain 4190(ATCC:40597)
                    by triton extraction of whole organisms followed by ultrafiltration and affinity
                    chromatography on mucin sepharose 4B. This material was used to produce
                    monoclonal antibodies harvested as mouse ascites. Five separate monoclonals
                    shown to be highly reactive against whole organisms by immunofluoresence
                    microscopy inhibited hemag- glutination by purified lectin at titers ranging
                    from 1:160 to 1:10,000.</p>
                <p>Control ascites never inhibited at dilutions greater than 1:20. Immuno- reactive
                    antigen was isolated directly from whole organisms following in- cubation in
                    $S-35 radiolabeled methionine supplemented media. The protozoa were extracted
                    with a buffer containing non-ionic detergent and protease inhibitor. This
                    material was analyzed using a solid phase immunoisolation technique (SPIT)
                    employing antibodies coated to plastic multiwell plates.</p>
                <p>Polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in sodium dodecyl-sulfate denaturing buffer
                    followed by autoradiography showed multiple protein bands with molecular weight
                    greater than 205 kDa. All five monoclonals examined gave identical
                    autoradiography patterns. Preliminary studies with cloned iso- lates of two
                    protozoal strains indicate that affinity purified lectin from strains 4190-5D
                    and 776-5A share immunologically reactive epitopes although differences in
                    adherence properties are observed. Additional studies using immunoaffinity
                    purified lectin should further define the role of these surface proteins in the
                    parasitic process.</p>

                <p>Echinococcus multilocularis; E. vogeli; Flow cytometry Growth rates of larval
                    Echinococcus spp. have been determined from increases in mass over time. Since
                    such tissue may contain host, germinal, and differentiated cells, in addition to
                    non-cellular material, that method does not directly provide information on the
                    proliferation of the germinal (invasive) tissue. Flow cytometry was used to
                    determine the cycle statistics of the germinal cells. Gerbils (Meriones
                    unguiculatus) and voles (Clethrionomys rutilus &amp; Microtus oeconomus) were
                    inoculated interperitoneally with larval tissue and maintained for various
                    periods. After collection, larval tissues were minced and treated with
                    collagenase at 37°C to isolate germinal and host cells. Protoscolices were
                    active and apparently unaffected. Cells were stained with ethidium bromide and
                    mithramycin. DNA fluorescence was analyzed with Phywe ICP 22.</p>
                <p>The dyes were excited by a mercury arc lamp (436 nm wavelength) and a 570 nm
                    long-pass filter was used for emission wavelengths. Resulting histograms were
                    analyzed with MCYCLE. Samples contained both host and germinal cells, but the
                    great disparity in DNA content resulted in separate histograms. Preliminary
                    results demonstrated that the growth rate of germinal cells of E.
                    multilocularis, as determined by S and G2, was approximately 22%, with no
                    difference between hosts. Growth rates did not appear to differ among infections
                    of 3 to 15 months duration. Infections of E. vogeli in gerbils had an average $S
                    and G2 of 15%; possibly reflecting developmental differences between cysts of
                    the two species.</p>

                <p>Trematodes, Fasciola hepatica, N-acetyltransferase N-acetyltransferase, the
                    regulatory enzyme of the "reverse-pathway" of polyamine metabolism in mammalian
                    and bacterial cells, was investigated and found to occur in Schistosoma mansoni,
                    Paragonimus uterobilateralis and Fasciola hepatica. Partially purified enzyme
                    from F. hepatica catalysed the acetylation of spermidine, norspermi- dine and at
                    a lower rate, spermine and norspermine. Unlike the corresponding enzyme from
                    mammalian liver, the N-acetyltransferase from F. hepatica catalysed putrescine
                    acetylation. Besides putrescine, other diamines including cadavarine,
                    1,3-diamino- propane and 1,6-diaminohexane were also acetylated by the trematode
                    enzyme. Histones were not substrates for this enzyme. The Michaelis constants
                    (Km) determined for spermidine, norspermidine, histamine and putrescine were
                    200uM, 140uM, 130uM and 40uM, respectively. The enzyme had an apparent molecular
                    weight (M) of about 40,000 and isoelectric point at pH 6.5. N-acetyltransferase
                    from F. hepatica was competi- tively inhibited by bis(benzyl)polyamine analog
                    (MDL 27695) with an inhibition constant (Kj) of 70uM. The enzyme depends on -SH
                    groups for the retention of activ- ity (this study was supported by the

                    School of Medicine, Hongo, Bunkyo-ku, Tokyo 113, Japan Leishmania mexicana,
                    Aspartate carbamoyltransferase, Pyrimidines, PALA Pyrimidines, as well as
                    purines, are essential compounds as precursors for nucleic acids and can be
                    synthesized through the de novo and salvage pathways. In view of the impor-
                    tance but relative lack of understanding of initial steps of the de novo
                    pyrimidine path- way in trypanosomatid parasites, we have purified and
                    characterized aspartate carbamoyl- transferase (ACT), the second enzyme of the
                    pathway, from culture forms of Leishmania mexicana amazonensis. Effect of a
                    specific inhibitor, N-(phosphonacetyl1)-L-aspartate (PALA), on the ACT activity
                    was also examined. When the Leishmania extract was first prepared in the absence
                    of glycerol, the activity of carbamoyl-phosphate synthetase II (CPS II), the
                    first enzyme of de novo pyrimidine synthesis, was rapidly lost. Thus, the
                    extract was prepared with phosphate buffer containing 30% glycerol, EDTA,
                    dithiothreitol, and 4 different protease inhibitors. Ammonium sulfate
                    fractionation of the extract, using a saturated ammonium sulfate solution
                    containing glycerol and EDTA, resulted in the separation of ACT and CPS II,
                    implying that these two enzymes do not constitute a multi- functional protein
                    but exist as independent proteins. The ACT was further purified by HPLC using a
                    gel filtration column of TSK Gel G4000SW, DEAE-Sepharose column chromato-
                    graphy, and again HPLC (TSK Gel G3000SW). SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis
                    of the purified ACT fraction demonstrated 2 protein bands with moleeular weights
                    of about 68000 and 59000, the former probably corresponding to the ACT. The ACT
                    was insensitive to various nucleotides including CTP, an allosteric inhibitor
                    for the Escherichia coli ACT, and other properties were similar to those of the
                    eukaryotic ACT. However, unusual properties, such as high molecular weight, high
                    K value for a substrate (carbamoyl phosphate), and high inhibition constant K,)
                    for "PALA, were found for the Leishmania ACT.</p>

                <p>Native electrophoresis followed by imprint digest method using human hemoglobin
                    as substrate allowed the detection of a strong parasite hemoglobinase activity
                    at acidic pH (3.9 to 5.0). The homology of this protease with an aspartyl
                    protease like cathepsin-D is suggested by the following results: 1) The specific
                    inhibition by pepstatin À (100 M ) and the lack of sensitive effects of cystein
                    and serine protease inhibitors.</p>
                <p>2) The molecular weight determination using modified SDS-PAGE followed by imprint
                    digest method demonstrated a single area of activity ranging from 55 KD to 58
                    KD. This size in accordance with cathepsin-D enzyme characterized in eucaryotic
                    cells.</p>
                <p>3) The parasitic origin of P. falciparum 55 KD protein was shown by
                    radiolabelling experiments with 35S-methionine. A partial purification on a
                    pepstatin A-agarose column of labelled parasite extracts followed by SDS-PAGE
                    and autoradiography originated a 55 KD protein. This protein was specifically
                    immunoprecipitated by a rabbit anticathepsin-D immune serum and immunopurified
                    on a IgG-CNBr sepharose column.</p>
                <p>4) The 55 KD protein was also detected by affinity purification of the
                    supernatant of labelled P.</p>
                <p>falciparum culture.</p>
                <p>5) We were able to confirm our results using non labelled proteins derived from
                    P.falciparum.</p>
                <p>On going experiments are in progress in order to characterize the cathepsin-D

                <p>Live liver fluke were incubated in Hedon-Fleig solution with L-(3-1%c) serine,
                    5-[l4c] tetrahydrofolic acid, 35$-methionine or L-[methy1-3x] methionine for 4 h
                    at 37°C in a shaking water bath. After the incubation the free and protein amino
                    acids were isolated, separated by TLC and the incorporation of label measured.
                    The results suggest that methionine can be synthesised via homocysteine
                    methyltransferase, with serine acting as a methyl donor via 5,10-methylene
                    tetrahydrofolate and 5-methyltetrahydrofolate. Liver fluke can also convert
                    methionine to cysteine via homocysteine and cystathionine, as in mammals. In
                    addition, methionine seems to be a potential methyl group donor for a variety of

                <p>Metabolic control, carbohydrate catabolism.</p>
                <p>Metabolic control theory allows the control structure of a metabolic pathway to
                    be rigorously defined and so has considerable potential in providing a
                    theoretical basis for the rational choice of target enzymes for drug
                    development. Energy metabolism in parasitic helminths is a particularly good
                    system for experimental analysis. Carbohyd- rate is the sole energy source,
                    there being no significant catabolism of lipid or amino acids, the pathways
                    involved are all linear and metabolism can be readily perturbed by
                    aerobic/anaerobic transitions.</p>
                <p>The flux control coefficients for the enzymes involved in carbohydrate catabolism
                    in the rat tapeworm Hymenolepis diminuta have been estimated using flux rates
                    and steady state metabolite measurements under different physiological
                    conditions. The model shows that 18 percent of the control strength resides in
                    hexokinase, 74 percent in phosphofructo- kinase, but only 1.8 percent in
                    pyruvate kinase. Sensitivity analysis shows that the key metabolites in
                    determining flux rate are glucose-6-phosphate and fructose-6-phosphate.</p>
                <p>The model is extremely robust in that doubling any of the enzyme elasticities
                    results in no more than a 10 percent redistribution of the control
                    strengths.</p>

                    Potential in vivo substrates include glucose, lactate and amino acids from

                    NaH13CO3, 1,2-1C-acetate or 1-13C-propionate.</p>
                <p>The incubation media and perchloric acid extracts of the worms were analysed by

                    of propionate and C-1 of succinate. The labelling patterns are consistent with
                    glucose catabolism via glycolysis to phosphoenolpyruvate followed by CO fixation
                    ultimately contributing to the succinate pool, from which n-propanol and

                    the definitive host environment have been studied in Hymenolepis diminuta.
                    Metabolic products from individual worms incubated in vitro were assayed at
                    different times of infection and in different developmental regions of the

                <p>Activities of key enzymes of metabolic pathways were determined in worm

                <p>During development à distinct shift in the pathways of carbohydrate metabolism
                    from lactate production (cytosolic metabolism) to succinate and acetate

                    mature worms from hosts in which low worm establishment is observed. It also
                    does not occur in a significant proportion of worm populations from hosts
                    infected following a self-cure of Nippostrongylus brasiliensis. The host
                    environment can thus markedly influence the pattern and regulation of metabolic
                    pathways in H. diminuta. These host-parasite interactions have important

                    metabolism of the proliferating larvae of M. corti by studying the effect of the
                    metabolic inhibitors oxalo- acetate and iodoacetate on the incorporation of
                    label from NaH “CO, into the excretory products lactate and succinate. These
                    products were coñverted to their methyl derivatives and analyzed by gas
                    chromatography/mass spectrometry {GC/MS) to determine the, isotope ratios. The
                    percent of [1- "C]lactate, [1- C]succinate and [1,4- "C,]succinate decreased in
                    the presence of oxalo- acetate; iodoacetate did nét significantly influence the
                    relative amount of the former, but markedly increased percentages of the latter
                    two. The data provide information on the relative rates of the pathways and
                    steps within them and the influence of the inhibitors on these pathways.</p>

                <p>Leishmania - cysteine proteases - chemotherapy One of the major objectives of
                    the-WHO workplan for the Leiïshmaniases is to develop non-toxic drugs for
                    chemotherapy. Fundamental to the design of such drugs is the understanding of
                    the biochemical nature of the parasite. There has beeen increasing interest in
                    the roles that proteases from parasites play in the invasion of host tissues, in
                    the evsion of the host immune response, as well as in the degradation of host
                    proteins. Proteolytic enzymes have been proposed as targets for the rational
                    design of new drugs for chemotherapy, offering an alternative to
                    vaccination.</p>
                <p>He have identified two major cysteine proteases from the promastigote stage of
                    Leishmania major, and have partially characterized them with respect to their
                    substrate specificity in fluorogenic assays, inhibition profile and relative
                    mobili- ties in substrate gels. These proteases have been purified by column
                    chromatography and submitted to amino-terminal sequencing. In addition, a
                    genomic DNA library was screened with a cysteine protease gene fragment from
                    Trypanosoma cruzi and two clones were isolated. Sequence analysis showed that
                    they represent two different cysteine protease genes.</p>

                <p>Fasciola - calcium - ionic regulation - atomic spectrophotometry In this study,
                    bovine flukes were subjected to altered external calcium (Ca) concentrations and
                    calcium-perturbing drugs to examine their mechanism of calcium regulation. The
                    normal [Ca**] of flukes 1s 0.025 + 0.014% (w/w), which ïs similar to that of
                    bovine bile: 0.015 + 0.002% (w/v). Incubation of flukes in ordinary Hedon-Fleig
                    saline (0.003% (w/vT Ca*t) resulted in an initial doubling of internal
                    [Ca**](Caj) within 0.25 h, followed by a decline to normal levels by 6 h. In
                    Catt-free saline (CFS), Caj fel1l to 35% normal in 0.25 h, then recovered to
                    normal by 1.5 h, remaining steady thereafter. The initial decrease în Ca; was
                    accompanied by à decrease in Kj and elevation of Naj. In 10 x normal Cat*
                    saline, Ca; rose at first (as in control) then returned to normal by 1 h. Over
                    this period, Na; and Ki varied erratically, with opposing fluxes. The response
                    to incubation in CFS containing the Cat* chelating agent EDTA (5 x 10-4 M) was
                    similar to CFS, but the recovery of Caj was slower. The Caj response to EGTA and
                    CDTA was similar to EDTA, although Caj declined following the initial recovery
                    (to 50% normal by 4h); Kj remained high and Naj fell to 45% normal by 4 h.
                    Following treatment with the calcium ionophore calimycin (A23187) (1 x 10-0 M),
                    Caj fell to zero within 1.5 h, with no recovery. The results suggest that the
                    liver fluke is able to adjust Cai fairly rapidly in response to altered Cas.
                    During this time, Naj and Kj varied, with opposing fluxes, but became more
                    settled, albeït abnormal, after 2 h. Cat+ chelating agents appear to accentuate
                    the effects of CFS. Calimycin produced an efflux of Cat*.</p>

                <p>Glutathione Glyoxalase 1 and 2 Lipid Peroxidation.</p>
                <p>Parasites are exposed to a range of oxygen-derived free radicals, an important
                    source being the host's immune effector cells. If unprotected, the parasite
                    membrane may be particularly susceptible to oxidative damage. A radical-induced
                    chain reaction results in the formation of lipid peroxides which, in turn,
                    decompose to produce a variety of carbonyl-containing compounds. Secondary
                    products of lipid peroxidation are cytotoxic, reacting with proteins and nucleic
                    acids. One possible route for the detoxification of carbonyls involves the
                    glutathione-dependent conversion of 2-oxoaldehydes to their corresponding
                    2-hydroxyacids, catalysed by the Glyoxalase system.</p>
                <p>Both glyoxalase 1 and glyoxalase 2 have been purified from helminths by affinity
                    chromatography, giving a single band using SDS-PAGE and silver staining. Both
                    enzymes have been partially characterised in terms of molecular weight,
                    isoenzyme pattern, iso- electric point,amino acid composition, N-terminal
                    sequence, reaction kinetics, substrate specificity and inhibitor
                    sensitivity.</p>
                <p>Comparison of purified glyoxalase 1 from the free-living nematode Panagrellus
                    redivivus with that of rat liver has revealed differences in subunit size and
                    inhibitor sensitivity while Moniezia expansa glyoxalase 2 resembles the
                    mammalian enzyme. However, a survey of glyoxalase activity in a wide range of
                    helminths indicates that cestodes and digeneans (unlike most other organisms)
                    appear to lack glyoxalase 1 but have consider- able glyoxalase 2 activity. It is
                    hoped that further investigation into glyoxalase 2 activity in helminths could
                    indicate a novel role in vivo and establish this enzyme as a potential target
                    for chemotherapy in cestodes and digeneans.</p>

                <p>Leishmania mexicana-in vitro differentiation The purpose of this study is to
                    determine the changes that occur when oromastigotes of Leishmania mexicana are
                    transfered from 27°C to 35°C, counled with a change of pH to 5.5.</p>
                <p>The cells were transfered to the higher temperature and lower pH, conditions
                    similar to those present in the macrophage”s parasitophorous vacuole,and labeled
                    with radioactive methionine. Protein synthesis rates were measured and the
                    polypeptide composition deter- mined by gel electrophoresis and fluorography.
                    The viability of the cells was determined by the use of differential stains, and
                    the morpholoaïcal and ultrastructural changes we- re followed by ontical and
                    electron microscony. The results indicate that the change of temperature and pH
                    produces the preferential synthesis of a group of polypeotides of 93,
                    87,83,70,40,32, and 23 Kd. The transformed cells excreted a large amount of
                    labeled mate- rial, specifically low molecular weight molecules durino the first
                    24 hours, and thereaf- ter high molecular weight peptides. The cells were viable
                    at 35°C up to 120 hours. If protein synthesis inhibitors were added
                    (Cycloheximide, Puromycin) the promastigotes at 35°C were not able to dismantle
                    the flagella, indicating a need for orotein synthesis for the process to occur.
                    When Leishmania cells were subjected in vitro to the change in tem- verature and
                    DH the following process was observed: cells became Snherical, lost the ex-
                    ternal portion of the flagella, the mitochondria was altered, vacuoles were
                    formed, and the cellular volume diminished to dimensions similar to those of the
                    amastigotes isolated from macrophages. This process occurs through the following
                    steps: the surface membrane undergoes deformation and at certain points
                    invaginates, the invaginations close off for- ming internal vacuoles surrounded
                    by microtubules. The membranes and microtubules are then possibly depolymerized
                    and the components either excreted or reutilized.</p>

                    Ascaris major fermentation products: 2-methylbutyrate and 2-mthylvalerate.
                    Purified Ascaris 2-mthylacetoacetyl CoA reductase differs from mmmalian @
                    -hydroxyacyl CoA dehydrogenase in its substrate specificity and kinetic
                    parameters (Z.Suärez- Mata, et.al. Arch.Biochem.Biophys. 225: 84 (1983)).
                    Ascaris 2-mthylacetoacetyl CoA reductase is unique in that it reacts
                    overwhelmingly in the direction of substrate reduction and is more active on the
                    branched-chain rather straight-chain acyl CoA substrate. This is in contrast
                    with the mmmalian (à-hydroxyacyl CoA dehy- drogenase which is more specific for
                    the straight chain CoA esters.</p>
                <p>In accord with these findings we have found that polyclonal antibodies against
                    purified Ascaris reductase failed to precipitate the mammalian dehydrogenase but
                    effectivily precipitated and inhibited the parasite en- zyme. Similarly
                    antibodies against commercially purified (è-hydroxyacyl CoA dehydrogenase from
                    pig heart failed to precipitate the Ascaris enzyme. These results indicate that
                    the parasite and host enzyme are inmunochemically different.</p>
                <p>In addition, we also found that both enzymes differ in their chemical
                    reactivities towards the sulphydryl reagents, p-chloromercuribenzoate (p-CMB)
                    and 5,5'-dithiobis (2-nitrobenzoate) (DINB). Incubation of Ascaris reductase
                    with either p-CMB (4.5 x 10-6 M) or DINB (1 x 10"4 M) resulted in a rapid and
                    significant loos of the enzyme activity. Contrariwise incubation of pig heart
                    dehydrogenase with these reagents did not affect its activity
                    significatively.</p>

                    enzyme activity of phosphoenolpyruvate metabolism was studied in hel- minths of

                    organ,liver,body cavity and large intestine. The highest py- ruvate kinase (PK)
                    activity (3.654 ukat/g protein) was found in Dictyo- caulus viviparus from the
                    lung and the lowest activity in Heterakis spu- mosa from the large intestine.

                    Dicrocoelium dendriticum from the 1Li- ver and its lowest value was found in
                    Syngamus trachea from the trachea.</p>
                <p>The highest malate dehydrogenase (MHD) activity (146.300 ukat/g protein) was

                    MHD in the helminths studied was found to differ depending on the site of their
                    parasitation. À similar dependance was also found for Km of the above enzymes.
                    The results suggest different metabolic adaptations in helminths, depending on
                    their localization in the host organism.</p>

                    recent experiments, electrically neutral Kf / HŸ exchange across the membrane
                    was demonstrated to be involved in the regulation of internal pH CpHi) of
                    Toxoplasma gondii (J. Protozool. 1987). Actually pHj was influenced directly by
                    the extracellular Kt concentrations, resulting in the increase in pi when the
                    extracellular K* was elevated in alkaline medium or when the external pH was
                    substantially increased in medium employing high external Kt. Extracellular ions
                    have also been demonstrated to correlate with several cellular events including
                    motility or infectivity of the tachyzoites (J. Protozool. 1990). For example,
                    they become motile in buffers where decreases in pi occur. The parasites in
                    which pHj is already low are no longer motile nor infective, whereas those of
                    which pH; kept high retain both the motility and infectivity.</p>
                <p>Based on the facts mentioned above, we examined the possible contribution of ph;
                    on the uptake of amino acids in buffers with varying ionic compositions using
                    35S- methionine as the prove. Interestingly, methionine uptake was observed at
                    alkaline ph in sulfate-salt buffers, especially in K2S04. Decreases in pli
                    caused the decreases in the methionine uptake. À possible mechanism for that
                    will be discussed with reference to the pHj regulation system in the
                    parasite.</p>

                    exploited a plasma opsonin for yeast in Biomphalaria glabrata strains which are
                    resistant to the PRI1 strain of Schistosoma mansoni. Since the opsonin is
                    inhibited by alpha-2-macroglobulin (an endopeptidase inhibitor), we have
                    investigated the role of protease activity in the process of opsonization. By
                    pre-treating yeast with pronase or bromelain prior to incubating the yeast in
                    snail plasma, we find evidence against the possibility that proteolytic activity
                    in the plasma prepare the yeast surface for opsonin-binding. SDS-PAGE analysis
                    reveals that the profile of plasma proteins which bind to yeast is altered by
                    the presence of a-2-macroglobulin. Since we could not detect endopeptidase
                    activity in the plasma, we looked for an endogenous endopeptidase inhibitor. We
                    found that B. glabrata plasma inhibits bromelain digestion of fibrinogen. It
                    appears that mannan-recognizing molecules in snail plasma may be converted to
                    active opsonins when an endogenous peptidase cleaves (a) bond(s) on the bound
                    molecule, thus exposing a B,1-3 linked glucan determinant for which evidence has
                    been presented previously. The presence of an endopeptidase inhibitor in snail
                    plasma may prevent spontaneous cleavage of this/these bond(s) in the absence of
                    an appropriate stimulus.</p>

                <p>Complex II(succinate-ubiquinone oxidoreductase; EC 1.3.99.1.), a membrane-bound
                    flavo- enzyme generally composed of four polypeptides, catalyzes the oxidation
                    of succinate to fumarate in the tricarboxylic acid cycle and transfers reducing
                    equivalents to quinones in the respiratory chain of mammalian and bacteria. On
                    the other hand, the complex II of Ascaris suum, which is harbored in the host's
                    small intestine where oxygen is fairly limited, has been shown to function
                    physiologically as a terminal oxidase of the NADH- fumarate reductase system in
                    the anaerobic respiratory chain. The flavoprotein subunit (Fp) of complex II
                    contains an active site and covalently bound FAD as an essential prosthetic
                    group. In this study, the amino acid sequences of the flavin-binding domain of
                    the Fp subunit in Ascaris complex II was determined to compare with those of
                    other species, because little information on the primary structure of
                    mitochondrial Fp has been available. The Fp subunit was isolated from Ascaris
                    complex II by Biogel P-60 column chromatography. The amino acid sequences of the
                    N terminal of the Fp subunit and tryptic peptides eluted from HPLC were
                    determined. The flavin-bound tryptic peptide of Ascaris Fp showed striking
                    homology with those of bovine heart and the sequences deduced from DNA sequences
                    of the genes for bacterial complex II. Further, sequence conservation was found
                    in two regions which had been predicted as AMP binding domains in the bacterial
                    Fp; a Rossman nucleotide binding fold close to the amino terminal and another
                    segment located near the middle of the peptide. These comparative data show that
                    Ascaris Fp is more closely related to sdh than to frd of Escherichia coli,
                    although Ascaris complex II exhibits high fumarate reductase activity. It is of
                    interest from the standpoint of the evolution of mitochondrial fumarate
                    reductase.</p>

                    continuation of primary cultures was applied to isolate the Em cells from the
                    tissue fragments. Trypsin was used for the enzymatic release of monodisperse
                    cells from the tissue fragments and for dispersing monolayers. Culture medium
                    was RPMI 1640 supplemented with penicillin (500 i.u./ml), streptomycin (500
                    ug/ml), 2 mM L-glutamine, 1 mM Na pyruvate, and 10% fetal calf serum.
                    Morphological features of isolated cells showed spindle-like cells in lower
                    passages, and then polygonal or star-like cells in higher passages. Population
                    doubling time of cells at passage 34 was approximately 23 hr and plating
                    efficiency of cells at the same passage was 15%. Chromosome numbers obtained
                    from 70 metaphase plates at passage 40 ranged between 14 and 104, and cells with
                    90-100 chromosomes were clearly predominant. The chromosomes could be
                    morphologically classified äinto telocentric, subterocentric, and metacentric

                    Intraerythrocytic malaria parasite produce vast amounts of lactic acid through
                    glycolysis. While lactate anions egress probably through specific transport
                    system, the mode of extrusion of H* is not known. P. falciparum (FCR-3)-infected
                    human red cells were permeabilized with Sendai virus to gain access to the
                    parasite membrane, attached to poly-L-lysine coated coverslips and loaded with
                    the fluorescent pH probe carboxyfluorescein. Parasite pH (pHi) was monitored
                    continuously in a spectrofluoro- meter while manipulating pHi (by means of the
                    K*/H* ionophore nigericin and K*- containing media of varying pH), medium pH
                    (pHo) or I[INa*] ([Na*lo), and H* efflux was calculated using the determined
                    value of cytosolic buffer capacity (33 mmol/1/pH unit). The resting pHi of ring
                    stage parasites was 7.27+0.1, while that of trophozoite was 7.31+0.12 (n=10).
                    Spontaneous acidification of the cytosol of glycolysing parasites was observed
                    in Na*-free medium and re-alkalinization occurred upon addition of Na* to the
                    medium in a [Na*]lo-dependent manner, obeying Michaelis-Menten kinetics (Ka *=33
                    mM; Vmax of H‘-efflux=32 mmol/l/min at 37°C). Na*-dependent H*-efflux was 1)
                    inhibited by the Na*/H* inhibitor EIPA; 2) augmented with rising pHo (pHi=6.2,
                    [Na*]o=30 mM) and 3) declined with increasing pHi (pHo=7.4; [Na*]o=30 mM).
                    pH-dependence of H*-efflux was much more pronounced at the trophozoite stage.
                    H*-efflux was totally obliterated only at pHi=7.8 ("set point") thus resembling
                    the mitochondrial rather than the cell membrane antiporter.</p>
                <p>Results indicate that H‘-egress is mediated by a Na*/H* antiporter that may play

                    University-Hadassah Medical School, Jerusalem, Israel Malaria-Oxidant Stress
                    Oxidative stress has been incriminated as a deleterious factor in the
                    development of malaria parasites. Various chemical reductones which can undergo
                    cyclic oxidation and reduction, such as ascorbate have been shown to cause
                    oxidative stress to red blood cells. This, naturally- occurring and redox-active
                    compound, can induce the formation of active oxygen derived species, such as
                    superoxide radical (-O2.), hydrogen peroxide (H2O:) and hydroxyl radical (OH:).
                    The formation of the hydroxyl radical, the ultimate deleterious species, is
                    mediated by the redox-active and available transition metals iron and copper in
                    the Haber-Weiss reaction.</p>
                <p>During the development of the parasite, hemoglobin is progressively digested and
                    a concurrent release of high levels of iron-containing breakdown products takes
                    place within the red blood cell.</p>
                <p>Indications for the progressive increase in redox-active iron during the growth
                    of P. falciparum have been recently found in our lab: a) adventitious ascorbate
                    proved highly detrimental to the parasite when added to the mature forms. In
                    contrast, if the parasites were in the early phase following invasion when low
                    levels of iron-containing structures had been accumulated, then the observed
                    effect of ascorbate was a slight enhancement of parasite development. b)
                    hemolysates of erythrocytes containing mature parasites could serve as a source
                    for redox-active iron in the metal-mediated degradation of the DNA. In contrast,
                    erythrocytes containing young ring forms had only a marginal effect and there
                    was no degradation after incubation of lysates of non-infected erythrocytes with
                    DNA. The addition of ascorbate to the lysates caused a dose and time dependent
                    increase in DNA degradation. These findings could also propose that the
                    parasite-dependent accumulation of redox-active forms of iron within the
                    erythrocytes may serve as a biological clock triggering the rupture of the red
                    blood cell membrane at the right moment, when the parasite reaches its
                    maturity.</p>

                    (penicillin - streptomycin - azlocillin). In our experiments P.maltophilia is a
                    commonly found aquatic microorganism highly resistant to various antibiotics,
                    characterized by two or more highly inducible beta-lactamases spanning the
                    entire range of B-lactams available to date.</p>
                <p>New f-lactams and new 6-fluoroquinolones, chosen by antibiotic susceptibility
                    tests were tested for their ability in axenisation. A disk selection was

                    supporting amoebae on one or two close-by antibiotic disks deposited on NNE.</p>
                <p>Amoebae migrate through the disk to reach the NNE underneath. The zone around the
                    single disk or between two disks cleared from bacteria and supporting amoebae is
                    used for axenisation in SCGYEM with antibiotic (ciprofloxacin and
                    ceftazidime).</p>
                <p>After transferring the strains successively on ciprofloxacin, ceftazidime and

                    adapted to SCGYEM with ciprofloxacin. In six other strains a selection of
                    multiresistant bacteria appeared. The association ticarcillin-clavulanic acid
                    and moxalactam (inhibiting the two maïn B-lactamases of P.maltophilia ) revealed
                    an excellent activity and cured the other strains from bacteria. Unlike
                    tetracyclines and other antimicrobial agents, these new antibiotics were well
                    tolerated by amoebae and could be useful for amoebic axenisation. Ciprofloxacin,

                    mice, or following incubation for 0.5 hr or 1.0 hr. Males and females were
                    incubated individually in Earle's balanced salt solution at 37°C. Lipase
                    activity was determined in frozen sections by Gomori's method using Tween 80 as
                    substrate. In unincubated males, lipase activity was localized only in the
                    parenchyma; in females it was present in the vitellaria and subtegument. After
                    0.5 hr incubation, males showed less lipase activity in the parenchyma than
                    unincubated males, and females showed increased activity in the subtegument, but
                    not in the vitellaria. Following 1.0 hr incubation, males showed less lipase
                    activity than previously, and females showed a marked increase in activity,
                    particularly in the subtegument. These observations suggest that both male and
                    female S. japonicum influence lipase activity and therefore lipid metabolism in
                    worms of the opposite sex.</p>

                <p>Schistosoma mansoni - cercariae - schistosomula - aerobic/anaerobic The life
                    cycle of Schistosoma mansoni includes free-living stages, which possess an
                    aerobic energy metabolism, and parasitic stages, which exhibit a largely
                    anaerobic metabolism. A transition from an aerobic to an anaerobic metabolism
                    occurs during infection of the final host when cercariae transform into
                    schistosomula. To investigate this biochemical transition, an in vitro model was
                    developed: incubation of cercariae at 37 °C in a simple salt medium (300 mOsm)
                    induced a very rapid (within 30 min) transition towards a more anaerobic
                    metabolism.</p>
                <p>The metabolic transition consisted of an increased production of pyruvate and
                    lactate, whereas Krebs-cycle activity remained more or less constant. On the
                    other hand, in water the energy metabolism of cercariae remained predominantly
                    aerobic for at least 20 hours. The anaerobic metabolism of cercariae in 300 mOsm
                    salt media resembled the metabolism of schistosomula which were fully
                    transformed by removal of the tails and by incubation for 3 hours in RPMI
                    medium. However, the biochemical transition induced by incubation in 300 mOsm
                    simple salt media was independent of a complete biological transformation and
                    independent of the loss of the tail. Incubations of separated bodies
                    (schistosomula) and tails demonstrated that the biochemical transition occurred
                    only in the bodies and not in the tails The biochemical transition is not
                    triggered by the loss of the tail since cercarial bodies remained aerobic when
                    incubated in water.</p>

                    organ, histochemical method, neutral mucopolysaccha- ride, alkaline phosphatase
                    Fibricola seoulensis is an intestinal tremtodes of the house rat and man, which
                    is endemic in Korea. It is known that this worm can cause acute gastrointestinal
                    symptoms in the infected person. In animal experiments, it entraps villi with
                    its tribocytic organ. In order to find the histochemical nature of the organs
                    which are important in digestion, a histochemical study was performed. The
                    tribocytic organ and tegument of F. seoulensis were examined for detection of
                    carbohydrates, mucosubstances, amyloid, collagen and alkaline phosphatase.
                    Involved stains were PAS, PAS with diastase, Alcian blue(pH 2.5), Toluidine
                    blue, Aldehyde-fuchsin, Southgate's mucicarmine, Sudan black B, Congo red,
                    Gomori's rapid one-step trichrome method, and double-bridge PAP for alkaline
                    phosphatase. The surface, secretes and gland cells of the tribocytic organ were
                    positive to periodic acid Schiff (PAP) and PAS with diastase. The tegument of
                    worms was also positive by staining. The surface and secretes of the tribocytic
                    organ and the tegument of worms were positive to double-bridge PAP for alkaline
                    phosphatase. It can be inferred that the tribocytic organ and the tegument of F.
                    seoulensis are composed of the neutral mucopoly- saccharide. The fact that the
                    structures were also positive to alkaline phosphatase suggests that these may
                    play a role as digestive and absorptive organs.</p>

                    complement cascade, C3a, Leishmania major The purpose of this study was to
                    understand the function of protein phosphorylation in the intracellular
                    parasite, Leishmania major. Preliminary studies demonstrated that promastigotes
                    contain an externally oriented membrane bound protein kinase(s) [1]. The
                    activity of the parasite enzymes are not regulated by modulators of common
                    protein kinases, cAMP, calmodulin, phorbol esters, etc. Live parasites are able
                    to phosphorylate exogenous protein substrates for protein kinases including
                    protamine sulfate, mixed histones and the C3 or C3b components of complement.
                    Phosphorylated C3 is less able to activate the alternative or classical pathways
                    of complement [2]. A leishmanial protein kinase (LPK-1) was purified 237 fold
                    from L.major. This enzyme could phosphorylate protamine sulfate and the C3, C5
                    or C9 components of complement.</p>
                <p>C3b was not phosphorylated by LPK-1. All of the radiolabel was present in the
                    Â-chain of C3 and C5. Trypsinization of C3 resulted in the conversion of C3 to
                    C3b and was correlated with the disappearance of the radiolabel in the Â'-chain
                    of C3b. The anaphylatoxin C3a was shown to contain the phosphorylation site
                    recognized by LPK-1. Phosphorylation of several synthetic peptides containing
                    the COOH-terminal region of C3a were examined. Serine 71, near the cell binding
                    COOH-terminal peptide, was shown to be a phosphorylation site for LPK-1.</p>
                <p>Protein phosphorylation by L.major might be involved in the regulation of
                    components from the complement cascade. This work was supported by the John and

                    towards bacteria has been well-known for some time and has been prevalently the
                    subject of electron microscope observations.</p>
                <p>Although this process deserves to be closely examined owing to its potential
                    involve- ment in protozoan life, it has been so far insufficiently studied, and
                    its mechanisms have been not exhaustively investigated.</p>
                <p>In this work, we study the different phagocytosis levels of certain T.vaginalis
                    is- olates against gram + ( Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 25923, Lactobacillus.

                    show qualitative and quantitative differences in the phagocytic uptake of
                    different bacterial species by T.vaginalis, and emphasize the variable role
                    played by the presence of serum in microorganism ingestion. We discuss our

                    which is the third enzyme in de novo pyrimidine biosynthesis.</p>
                <p>We have purified the enzyme from two parasitic protozoa, Crithidia fasciculata
                    (about 16,000- fold) and Plasmodium berghei (about 790-fold). The C.fasciculata
                    enzyme had a native molecular weight (Mr) of 42,000 + 5,000, determined by gel
                    filtration chromatagraphy, and showed a single band detectable protein band on
                    sodium dodecyl sulfate- polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS- PAGE) with a Mr
                    of 44,000 + 3,000. The DHOase from P. berghei had a native Mr of 40,000 + 4,000
                    and a subunit Mr on SDS-PAGE of 38,000 + 3,000. The DHOase from both parasites,
                    in contrast to the mammalian enzyme which resides on a trifunctional protein of
                    the first two enzyme of the pathway, carbamyl phosphate synthase and aspartate
                    transcarbamylase, is a monomeric enzyme and has no oligomeric structure as
                    studied by chemical crosslinking with dimethyl suberimidate. The rate of
                    cyclization of L-CA by the C.fasciculata enzyme was relatively high at acidic
                    pH, decreasing to a very low rate at alkaline pH In contrast, the rate of ring
                    cleavage of L-DHO was very low at acidic pH and increased to a maximal rate at
                    alkaline pH. These pH activity profiles gave an intersection at pH 6.6. The Km
                    and kcat for L-CA were 0.846 + 0.017 mM and 39.2 + 6.4 min}, respectively; for
                    L-DHO , they were 25.85 + 2.67 uM and 258.6 + 28.5 min !. The cryoprotectant
                    dimethyl sulfoxide (Me2SO) used as stabilizing agent in the complete
                    purification and storage, markedly affected the DHOase activity. MeSO increased
                    the catalytic efficiency of the enzyme, as measured by Kcat/Km» in the ring
                    cyclization reaction, but had no effect on the ring cleavage reaction. In spite
                    of their marked physical differences, these kinetic and inhibitors studies with
                    5-substituted derivatives of orotic acid suggest that the protozoan, mammalian
                    and procaryotic enzymes have a common catalytic mechanism.</p>

                <p>Biphasic, semi-solid and liquid media are largely used for the cultivation of
                    Trypanosomatidae. However, biphasic and semi-solid media require blood as an
                    important poorly defined fluid for parasites proliferation.</p>
                <p>Moreover most of the liquid culture media need a supplement of inactivated fetal
                    calf serum (FCS) as an essential factor for flagellates growth. Finally, the few
                    defined media yet described are inusefull with regards of their qualitative
                    complexity and their high cost. The heterogeneity of the media used to cultivate
                    members of the Leishmania genus complicated and limitated the feasibility of
                    numerous studies. Therefore an usefull and inexpensive chemically defined medium
                    for cultivation of Leishmania has been developed.</p>
                <p>The basic composition of the defined medium was RPMI 1640 used at the 1,1 M
                    concentration supplemented with concentrated medium 199 H and hemin.lt was
                    referred as RPMI 199H. Various members of theLeishmania genus were classically
                    cultured in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated FCS. They were
                    adapted first in an equal mixture of the defined medium and the serum containing
                    RPMI during three to four subcultures and then in complete defined medium.
                    Parasites growth were studied and compared on short and long term periods in
                    RPMI1640 , RPMI+ 10% inactivated FCS and the RPMI 199H.</p>
                <p>The defined medium supported continuous growth of all the Leishmania species
                    studied after repeated subcultures yieldind large numbers of parasites free of
                    extraneous material. Morphological criteria and in vitro infectivity of L.

                <p>Leishmania; Trypanosomatidae protozoan; in vitro growth and differentiation.</p>
                <p>In this report we attempted to characterize the physico-chemical and biological
                    properties of a Trypanosomatidae growth factor (TRYGE) in order to understand
                    the mechanism involved in the regulation of the in vitro growth and
                    differentiation of Leishmania promastigotes.</p>
                <p>Various Leishmania species were adapted and maintained by subcultures in a
                    chemically defined LITR9 medium. Culture experiments were initiated in
                    conditioned culture supernatants, prealably collected by centrifugation and
                    precleared of flagellates by filtration. Supernatants were daily removed and the
                    organisms resuspended in conditioned supernatant used for the seeding. By means
                    of a monoclonal antibody (IHIB1/26) generated against L. chagasi surface antigen
                    in depletion experiments, the growth stimulating activity was removed and the
                    TRYGF was recovered from conditioned supernatants after detergent solubilization
                    of the corresponding ultracentrifugated IgM Immune complex. To study
                    promastigotes-macrophage interactions, normal resident peritoneal exudate cells
                    from BALB/c mice was used.</p>
                <p>We demonstrated that a non species specific immunologically-acive glycoprotein of
                    70,000 Mr (GP 70), stimulated at low concentrations the L. chagasi promastigotes
                    in vitro growth but was inhibitory at high doses. The dose dependence of the
                    isolated TRYGF bifunctional activity supported the hypothesis of an autocrine
                    growth regulation involving a negative feed-back mecanism. Immunoprecipitation
                    experiments by IB1/26 of 125 I-labeled surface components of various
                    Trypanosomatidae protozoan demonstrated the surface localization and the closed
                    structural similarity of the GP 70 amongTrypanosomatidae. Additional da- ta
                    strongly argued that the ratio : promastigotes rates / TRYGF concentration
                    directly influenced the in vitro Leishmania differentiation.</p>
                <p>Together these data lead us to consider TRYGF as an essential component in the
                    modulation of parasites multplication and infectivity.</p>

                    to culture the trypanosome of domestic animals. The parasites of these two
                    strains retained their infectivity to mice after culturing in vitro for more
                    than 60 days. The growth curves of these two strains of T. evansi in KMB cells
                    and in ZUKF cells showed no obvious difference.</p>
                <p>Such results showed that the donors of suitable supporting cells for culture of

                    synthesis Jarroll et. al. (Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 32:121-132, 1989) employed
                    GC/MS analysis to identify galactosamine [GalN] as a Giardia cyst wall-specific
                    amino hexose. To determine the origin of GalN during cy$t wall synthesis,
                    Giardia trophozoïites were grown or encysted in the presence of C-precursors of
                    GalN; unlabeled trophozoites were assayed for enzymes involved in GalN
                    synthesis. Labeled glucose [Gle] (11.71 pmoles/mg dry weight [dw]l), glucosamine
                    [GlceN] (20.67 pmoles/mg dw), GalN (2.98 p moles/mg dw), galactose [Gal] (1.69
                    pmoles/mg dw) and mannose [Man] (0.89 p moles/mg dw) were incorporated mainly
                    into the Glc containing spot following thin laye chromatography [TLC] of
                    nonencysting trophozoite hydrolysates. Incorporated C-Gle (2.69 p moles/mg dw)
                    and GlcN (0.76 p moles/mg dw) were detected in Glc, GalN and GIlcN

                    lysates coupled with the apparent absence of this enzyme activity in
                    nonencysting trophozoïites support the ideas that Giardia synthesizes GalN from
                    Glc or from salvaged GIlcN, and that the synthesis of at least one key enzyme,
                    UDP-GlcNAc 4' epimerase, is induced during the encystment process. GlcN, below
                    the limits of detection in nonencysting trophozoites, intact cysts and cyst
                    walls, appears to be present only as a transient intermediate in the synthesis
                    of GalN. This study was supported by the CSU College of Graduate Studies (TM)

                    development in G6PD-deficient erythrocytes has been shown. This retardation was
                    associated with both impaired invasion and intracellular development. Usanga and
                    Luzzatto (Nature, 313, 793, 1985) suggested that when the parasites develop in
                    G6PD-deficient erythrocytes, they undergo adaptive changes to activate the G6PD
                    gene and to produce their own enzyme which enables them to circumvent the
                    unfavorable conditions presented by the abnormal host cell and to develop
                    similarly in the deficient cell as in the normal one.</p>
                <p>We cultured P. falciparum for 40 cycles in G6PD-deficient erythrocytes and
                    challenged the parasitized erythrocytes with ascorbate and copper, which served
                    to exert an oxidative stress.</p>
                <p>Our results suggest that the adapted variant demonstrates only a moderate
                    enhancement of resistance to oxidative stress in G6PD-deficient cells. The
                    parasite adaptation may, therefore, be sufficient to compensate for only minor
                    oxidative stress, which may be induced by the developing parasite but not for
                    additional exogenous agents. In addition, we have found at least one variant of
                    P. falciparum (VNS) that cannot adapt itself to develop within the
                    G6PD-deficient erythrocytes. lt is important, therefore, to examine different
                    variants of P. falciparum in an area where malaria is endemic and where G6PD
                    deficiency is ubiquitous to further evaluate the hypothesis presented by Usanga
                    and Luzzatto.</p>

                    causative agent of sporothricose are of -interest by virtue of their immunogenic
                    properties.In this human pathogen,previous studies have demonstrated that the
                    carbohydra te component of Sporothrix schenckii peptidorhamnomannan is attached
                    cova- lenty to protein. Structural analysis of the rhamnomannans has established
                    that the polysaccharide has an æ-]1- 6-linked D-mannose backbone. Rhamno-
                    mannans having single unit &lt;-L-rhamnopyranosyl and (1 2)-linked di-«-L-

                    oligosaccharides attached by O-glycosyl bonds in the peptidorhamno- mannan. We
                    verified that mild alkaline degradation of Sporothrix schenckii

                <p>Glycolysis - Anaerobic metabolism - Trichomonads - Giardia - Isotricha There is
                    growing evidence that in the nature of certain important glycolytic enzymes
                    various anaerobic protists differ from other eukaryotes. Trichomonad
                    flagellates, Trichomonas vaginalis and Tritrichomonas foetus contain a specific
                    high affinity gluco- kinase instead of a hexokinase of broad specificity and a
                    PPi-dependent phosphofructo- kinase, which catalyzes an easily reversible
                    reaction, instead of an ATP-dependent one.</p>
                <p>Although the phosphorylation of hexoses and of fructose-6-phosphate are usually
                    highly regulated steps in glycolysis, no effectors were found which affected the
                    trichomonad enzymes studied. Unregulated PPi-dependent phosphofructokinases were
                    also found in other anaerobic protist parasites, Giardia lamblia, Entamoeba
                    histolytica, as reported earlier by Reeves et al. and Isotricha prostoma. The
                    presence of this enzyme obviates the need for ATP in the second phosphorylating
                    step of glycolysis; thus increasing its energy yield. These data suggest that
                    glycolysis and its regulation are very different in anaerobic protozoa which
                    rely almost exclusively on this pathway for their supply of ATP, as compared to
                    the aerobic ones which obtain most of the ATP by mitochondrial oxidative
                    phosphorylation.</p>

                <p>Superoxide dismutases, Coccidiosis, Eimeria tenella Anti-oxidant enzymes and the
                    role of oxidants in immunity have recently received much attention in
                    parasitology. These enzymes protect parasites against oxidant-mediated damage
                    which occurs as a consequence of normal cellular metabolic processes and host
                    immune responses. Coccidiosis is an economically important disease of poultry
                    which 1s caused by protozoa of genus Eimeria, of which one of the more
                    pathogenic 1s E.tenella.</p>
                <p>We examined the anti-oxidant mechanisms of E.tenella and determined its
                    susceptibility to oxidants. Unsporulated oocysts of E.tenella have high
                    superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity and contain two electrophoretically distinct
                    forms of the enzyme, namely a Cu/Zn-SOD and a Fe-SOD. Sporulated oocysts have
                    low SOD activity and contain only one form of the enzyme (Mn-SOD) which was also
                    found in sporozoites. In vitro, sporozoites are oxidant-sensitive and die within
                    minutes of superoxide generation. These data suggest that E.tenella sporulated
                    oocysts and sporozoites lack soluble cytoplasmic Cu/Zn-SOD and that this
                    deficiency may contribute to the oxidant sensitivity of the parasite. It is
                    possible that the parasite 1s protected in vivo by soluble SOD acquired from
                    host cells as has been reported for murine malarial parasite Plasmodium
                    berghei.</p>

                    cultured axenically in vitro, and the localization of acid phosphatase(AcPase)
                    was determined with cytidine 5'-monophosphate as a component of sub- strate. On
                    the observations with transmission electron microscope the majority of memb-
                    rane limited vacuoles and rough endoplasmic reticulum in cytoplasm showed
                    positive reac- tions, and reactive acanthopodium were rarely observed. No
                    reactivity was observed on Golgi-complex and mitochondrion of normal amoeba. But
                    an amebae treated with antiserum mitochondrion showed positive reactions
                    occasionally. Vacuoles showing AcPase positive reactions were characterized into
                    5 phases according to intensity of the reactivity; strong positive in small
                    sized lysosomes, large reaction products in food vacuoles and/ or their
                    distinctively positive limiting membranes, weak reactions in vacuolar contents
                    and on membrane, non-reactive food vacuoles which contain vacuolar contents, and
                    non- reactive, empty food vacuoles and contractile vacuoles, Strong reactive
                    lysosomes and vesicles were often aggregated and fused each other as reaction
                    products in certain vacuoles. AcPase positive vacuoles were often fused and
                    connected each other. With the results it is presumed that digestive process of
                    this ameba takes place in food vacuoles activated after fusion with
                    lysosomes.</p>

                    the breathing enzymes of 11 L. major strains depending on their virulence.
                    Cytochemical activity of all strains was studied during 30- 35 days Ôf their
                    growth in culture medium, beginning with the 2 anû en- ding with the 20-th
                    passage. The degree of the activity was represented by the mean number
                    cytochemically revealed granulars in 50-100 examined strains in different stages
                    of development in culture. Diapharase acti- vity in the form of granules of
                    phormasan differed depending on the nu mber of passage. The highest degree of it
                    was noted in the second pas- sage (from 10-15) the lowest in the 20-th passage
                    (from 2 to 6) granu- les. The strains which preserved virulence had higher
                    degree of diapha- rase activity, than those which lost it. Peroxidase activity
                    was noted on the 10-20-th day of cultivation of leishmanias in culture, mainly
                    in stationary phase of growth. Alongside with diapharase activity a gra- dual
                    decrease in peroxidase activity was noted from one passage to the other, which
                    was completely lost by the 20-th passage. Thus, it was shown that the
                    significant decrease in diapharase activity testifies for the loss of virulence
                    in leishmania strains.</p>

                <p>Trichobilharzia ocellata-Schistosoma mansoni-eicosanoids Our laboratory has
                    previously demonstrated that cercaria of S. mansoni produce a wide array of
                    eicosanoids when exposed to linoleic acid. Moreover, transformation and the
                    early stages of penetration can be correlated to specific eicosanoid products
                    and these may be critical to both the transformation and penetration processes.
                    Although the cer- caria of T. ocellata undergo transformation to schistosomules
                    and penetrate mammalian skin, the response is limited and penetration is
                    incomplete, producing the so-called ‘swimmers' itch' phenomenon. For these
                    reasons and because the eicosanoids of S. man- soni may be playing an
                    immunoregulatory role in assisting these cercaria to evade host defense
                    mechanisms, we sought to examine eicosanoid production in T. ocellata, compared
                    to S. mansoni. Cercaria of T. ocellata were incubated for 1 hr. with 3mM
                    linoleic acid containing 1I14C linoleic acid tracer. Products were extracted
                    with methanol, separated by Reverse Phase HPLC and eicosanoids compared to
                    standards were detected with an in- line Ramona D-scintillation counter. Areas
                    under the peaks as well as individual peaks were compared and analyzed with a
                    LABTEX CHROM program and compared to those obtained from S. mansoni. The results
                    show that the two parasites both synthesize three primary groups of eicosanoids,
                    ie, prostaglandins, leukotrienes, and hydroxyeicosatetranoic acids. Preliminary
                    findings indicate that significat quantitative differences exist; the cercaria
                    of S. mansoni producing substantially more eicosanoids of all types on a per
                    gram protein basis, but no significant qualitative differences in eicosanoid
                    peaks were discernable with this method. These findings suggest that eicosanoids
                    are common to the transformation and early penetration events of both
                    parasites.</p>

                    infestation by helminths commonly induces mucosal mast cell (MMC) proliferation.
                    Although it has been proposed that products of these MMC might influence the
                    worms directly, causing damage leading to worm expulsion, sufficient evidence
                    supporting this view is missing. In this study, we present the effects of
                    histamine and serotonin on the glucose metabolism of H. diminuta. Tapeworm
                    excretory products from culture media, containing labelled glucose and various
                    concentrations of the above amines, were analyzed by ‘H nuclear magnetic
                    resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. The results revealed that histamine markedly
                    accelerated the glycolysis process as indicated by the increased amount of
                    lactate in the incubation medium.</p>
                <p>Comparable concentrations of serotonin had no effect on the lactate production.
                    Both amines prevented, to different extent, the formation of acetate and
                    succinate, suggesting an inhibitory effect on the carbohydrate pathway between
                    PEP and malate. Thus this work confirms that the MMC mediators histamine and
                    serotonin directly influence energy metabolism in the intestinal tapeworm H.

                <p>Leishmania donovani (Sudanese strain, highly adapted to serum-free defined
                    medium; S1) promastigotes have been reported to possess two nucleosides
                    transporters with specificity for adenosine and inosine, based on kinetic and
                    genetic evidence, with uridine sharing only the adenosine transporter. However,
                    our initial studies on nucleoside transport in promastigotes of a strain
                    generally propagated in serum- containing medium (MHOM/ET/67/HU3; S2) as well as
                    a local fresh patient isolate of L. major indicated that adenosine was not or
                    only very poorly transported by these organisms. More detailed investigation of
                    transport (1 UM ‘H-labeled nucleosides, 30 s incubations at 22°C, stopping
                    reactions by addition of unlabeled permeant and rapid centrifugation through
                    underlying oil layers; rates expressed as mol/cell/s x 102, SDM's about 10%)
                    revealed that S1 transported adenosine, inosine and uridine at rates of 32, 23
                    and 2, and S1 at 23, 7 and 0, respectively. Moreover, inosine transport was
                    inhibited about 50% by 100 UM adenosine in both S1 and S2, while uridine was
                    without effect. Thus we assume that adenosine enters S2 via îts inosine
                    transporter and conclude that the adenosine transporter, an entity genetically
                    differentiated from the inosine transporter in Sl, is absent or highly
                    suppressed in S2. These results indicate that data obtained from a
                    laboratory-maintained strain such as S1 may not reflect the properties of other
                    leishmania strains including highly infective ones, Considering that nucleoside
                    derivatives are of potential therapeutic value, the need to conduct studies on
                    the handling of such nucleosides by different strains of leishmania is
                    emphasized.</p>

                    protozoan parasite Giardia lamblia is the causitive agent of giardiasis in man.
                    Infections arise when viable cysts are injested. Cysts of G.lamblia show respir-
                    atory activity and are therefore not true cryptobiotic forms. The most important
                    feature of respiration in cysts was the presence of a threshold for 0» above
                    which respiratory activity decreased. This inhibition occurred at 0
                    concentrations &gt; 30yM and was irreversible. O inhibition thresholds have been
                    observed in trophozoites of G.lamblia; cysts and trophozoites of G.muris. In
                    Trichomonas vaginalis inhibition of 02 uptake was correlated with the production
                    of active 0, species. The effects of temperature on O2 uptake in cysts indicated
                    that respiration would be negligible at temperatures below 7°9C, lower
                    temperatures also favour cyst viability. These two factors may be linked; at
                    reduced temperatures the rate of endogenous substrate utilis- ation would be
                    decreased thereby increasing the viable lifetime of the cysts. These results may
                    explain the high incidence of giardiasis in populations where water is untreated
                    and supplied from cold streams. The effects of various inhibitors on O2 uptake
                    in cysts shows that quinones and flavoproteins may play some role in
                    respiration.</p>
                <p>The most important observations were (1) Metronidazole, the drug most commonly
                    used in the treatment of giardiasis, had no effect on cyst respiration or
                    viability. This observation suggests that patients with giardiasis would
                    probably pass viable cysts for several days after treatment with Metronidazole.
                    (2) Menadione a redox cycling napthoquinone was a potent inhibitor of cyst
                    viability and respiration. It would seem therefore that compounds such as
                    Menadione, that generate 0, radicals may have potential as chemotherapeutic
                    agents for the treatment of glardiasis.</p>

                <p>The major neutral lipids were triacylglycerides, cholesterol and to a certain

                    sphingomyelin. The glycolipids, corresponding to ë.4 % of the total lipids, were
                    also analyzed. The neutral and acid gly- cosphingolipids accounted for 95 % and
                    5 % respectively of the total.</p>
                <p>In the neutral glycolipids 12 different fractions were separated. 3 im- portant
                    fractions were migrating in the same region as the control mono-

                    manifested between gastrointestinal parasites by both the number of components
                    into which the homogenats of nematods and proboscis worms are sepa- rated and
                    the distribution of the components in the main protein fractions. In this way
                    the cavitary parasite amphiline differs from the gastrointestinal ones. A half
                    of the protein components of amphi- lins are similar in their electrophoretic
                    mobility to host proteins which probably points to paral- lelism of the protein

                    due to transglycosilation reaction on the parasite cell sur-
                    face(Mol.Biochem.Parasitol. 16,85-96,1985). Experiments using lectins have shown

                    amount found in T.cruzi Y-strain(Hoppe-Seyler's Z.Physiol.Chem. 364,
                    1053-1057,1983). The identification of sialic acid,isolated from T.cruzi
                    G-strain,by TLC,GLC-MS and FAB-MS,revealed the presence of only N-acetyl-
                    neuraminic acid. These results indicated that the sialic acid-containing
                    molecules are differents in both,Y-and G-strain of T.cruzi. The high amount of
                    N-acetylneuraminic acid in T.cruzi G-strain and the absence of WGA agglutination
                    pattern are compatible with the presence ss a polysia- lyl structure.</p>

                    Acetylcholinesterase was identified and characterised in the serum of
                    microfilaremic patients to see whether the parasitic Acetylcholinesterase is
                    also present in the serum and also to understand the role of this enzyme in host
                    parasite relationship.</p>
                <p>The activity of enzyme was studied by Ellman's et al (1961). The isozymic pattern
                    of the enzyme was studied by Karnovsky &amp; Roots (1964).</p>
                <p>Electrophoresis was performed by the original method of Davis. The microfilaremic
                    serum has about 4 times more activity than normal serum. The isozymic pattern of
                    the mocrofilaremic serum showed 5 bands where as normal serum showed only three
                    bands.</p>
                <p>The enzyme was inhibited by the eserine, the specific inhibitor for
                    acetylcholine- sterase the effect of different Substrate concentration showed
                    the Michaliesmenton relationship with normal serum whereas microfilaremic enzyme
                    was inhibited at substra- te concentration 5.00x10 M and above. The KM value for
                    normal serum Acetylcholineste- rase was found to be 125x1076 M, whereas for
                    microfilaremic serum the KM value was 260x107$M.</p>
                <p>Thus there are significant differences between normal &amp; microfilaremic
                    acetylcholines- terase suggesting the possibility of the presence of parasitic
                    enzyme in the microfil- aremic serum. The parasitic Acetylcholinesterase could
                    constitute a possible antigenic target for immunity &amp; could have a
                    significant influence on the host parasite rela- tionship.</p>

                    metabolism Giardia intestinalis resides in the human small intestine, from where
                    it obtains the appropriate nutrients for growth and metabolic integrity. It has
                    been commonly accepted that Giardia utilises only glucose as an energy source,
                    and produces ethanol and acetate as the principal products. However, this model
                    is no longer tenable as we have recently shown that alanine is a major end
                    product.</p>
                <p>This finding prompted us to critically appraise the role of glucose in giardial
                    energy metabolism. We have now observed that giardial trophozoites do not
                    require the high glucose concentrations (normally 50 mM) present in culture
                    media such as Diamond's TY1-S-33.</p>
                <p>Giardia can grow in medium containing virtually no glucose (&lt; 2 mM).
                    Furthermore the glucose which is utilised at this or higher concentrations (up
                    to 50 mM) can account for only half or less of the end products. These
                    observations suggest that other carbon sources are important, the most likely
                    being amino acids or protein. This view is strengthened by our finding that
                    arginine is rapidly utilised by Giardia with the simultaneous production of
                    ornithine and ammonia, suggesting the presence of the arginine dihydrolase
                    pathway. We have now confirmed the presence of the individual enzymes of this
                    pathway and preliminary carbon balance studies suggest that this pathway can
                    supply up to a third of the ATP requirements.</p>
                <p>Thus it is now clear that the accepted view that glucose is absolutely essential
                    for all giardial energy requirements is no longer tenable, and that arginine is
                    potentially a major energy source.</p>

                    population against Zoonotic Cuteneous Leishmaniasis (ZCL), nowdays, vaccines are
                    used quite seldom because of non-standardness and short preservation period of
                    vaccinating material. The aim of our study was to test vaccinability of alive
                    leishmanial culture, stored in the liquid nitrogen for 6 months, in experiments
                    on white mice and hamsters., Leishmanial culture was defrozen at 37° C after
                    preservation for above-mentioned period of time and examined microscopically. We
                    found that 90-95% of leishmania promastigotes preserved active mobility and
                    morphological properties at cell concentration in initial suspension of
                    20mln/ml. During the period of 1 hour 15 white mice and 10 hamsters were
                    infected by means of int- radermal injection into the ear conch in a dose of 0,1
                    ml. All animals got infected and leishmanial process did not differ from that of
                    cont- rol (5 hamsters and 10 white mice infected with native leishmanial cul-
                    ture). Thus, preservation of leishmaniél culture in liquid nitrogen, allows to
                    accumulate material, to store it and use for vaccination for 6 months without
                    changing of properties and recultivation in culture medium, S2.C 57 P.</p>

                    freed from host membranes including the parasitophorous vacuole one. Their
                    organelles do not show any swelling or disruption, suggesting by the way a

                    Ascaris, complex I , respiratory chain, fumarate reductase, mitochondria The
                    adult parasitic nematode, Ascaris suum, respires anaerobically through the
                    mitochon- drial NADH-fumarate reductase system where fumarate serves as a
                    terminal electron accep- tor at the low oxygen tensions in the lumen of host's
                    small intestine. We have demon- strated that adult mitochondrial complex I
                    functions as a terminal enzyme of the NADH- fumarate reductase system; electrons
                    from NADH are accepted by complex I, mediated by rhodoquinone, and transferred
                    to fumarate by the complex I ïin its reverse direction, The nematode complex I
                    is composed of four subunits; Fp and Ip subunits and two smaller subunits, Cy b,
                    and Cy b,. In contrast with the adult nematode, Ascaris second-stage larva was
                    shown to have aäerobic respiratory chain with functional cytochrome c
                    oxidase.</p>
                <p>However, information on its electron-transfer components and complex II in
                    particular, is limited. In order to elucidate mechanisms of aerobic-anaerobic
                    respiratory transi- tion during life cycle of Ascaris nematode, the larval
                    respiratory chain has been characterized in the isolated mitochondria by
                    spectrophotometry, immunoblotting using anti adult complex I antibodies and
                    determination of quinones. Low temperature differ- ence spectra showed
                    occurrence of substrate-reducible cytochromes aa,, € + c, and b in complex II.
                    Cy b, subunit in the larval mitochondria exhibited diffèrent reäctivities
                    against anti adult Cy b, antibodies. Km values for succinate were comparable
                    between complexes I from adult and second-stage larvae but different Km values
                    were obtaïned for fumarate. Analyses of quinones by HPLC showed that
                    mitochondria from the second-stage larvae contained ubiquinone as a major
                    component. These results suggest that larval complex I is different from the
                    adult counterpart and conversion of quinones occurs during the life cycle of
                    Ascaris nematode.</p>

                    neurotransmitter serotonin (5-HT),found in cestode tissues, can be not only
                    absorbed by parasites from the host body, but can be also synthesized in their
                    tis- gues from its metabolic precursor - tryptophan (Ribeiro,Webb,1983,1984;
                    Terenina et al.,1988). These data are suggestive of the presence in helminths of
                    tryptophan hydroxylase (TPH (EC 1.14.16.4)- a key enzyme of the 5-HT
                    biosynthesis,wich catalyzes the conversion of tryptophan into
                    5-hydroxytryptophan.</p>
                <p>The purpose of the present work was to study the activity of TPH in ces- tode
                    Hymenolepis diminuta.After partial purification of the tissue ext- ract by
                    fractionation with ammonium sulfate, the enzyme activity was measured by the
                    fluorimetric method (Kulikov,1988) with slight modifica- tions at L-tryptophan
                    concentrations of 0.1 and 0.8 mM in the presence of the cofactor
                    2-amino-4oxy-6,7-dimethy1-5,6,7,8-tetrahydropterin (DMPH,). The experimental
                    results obtained demonstrated the presence in helmiâths of TPH with relatively
                    low activity.Nevertheless, the obtai- ned data suggest that cestodes synthesize
                    5-HT de novo. Further inves- tigations of the enzyme properties in the parasite
                    and host will evi- dently not only permit us to broaden the existing notions
                    about the biochemical aspects of their relations but will be of great impotance
                    for the search of effective antihelminthic drugs of low toxicity.</p>

                    of aerdbic conditions. The nematode also exhibited a distinct anaerobic
                    metabolism that resuited in the accumulation and excretion of succinate.</p>

                    nematodes, Ascaris suum To provide quantitative and mechanistic insight into
                    drug transport properties of gastrointestinal nematodes, mass transport studies
                    were conducted using isolated cuticle from Ascaris suum. Cuticle sections were
                    mounted in two-chamber diffusion cells and steady-state rates of flux were
                    determined for a number of radio-labelled permeants which varied in molecular
                    size, lipophilicity and electrical charge. The permeability coefficient of the
                    collagen matrix (lipid-extracted cuticle) vs molecular radius relationship
                    showed the interdependence of molecular size and electrical charge of the
                    permeants with respect to the aqueous pores of the negatively charged
                    matrix.</p>
                <p>The permeability of neutral solutes decreased monotonically with size. Protonated
                    amines permeated the aqueous pores faster than neutral solutes of comparable
                    size while the permeation of anions was slower. The average pore size was
                    estimated to be 15Â in radius. The effective permeability coefficient of the
                    nonlipid- extracted cuticle was delineated into the permeability coefficients of
                    the water-filled collagen matrix and the lipoidal component of the cuticle to
                    determine which layer was the rate-controlling barrier. While each solute was
                    capable of penetrating the water-filled collagen matrix, the rate-determining
                    step for the majority of compounds was passive diffusion across the lipid
                    component, which controlled 75-99% of transport. The exception was water, for
                    which transport kinetics were 75% matrix-controlled In general, permeation
                    across the lipid-filled tissue was more favorable for small lipophilic
                    compounds.</p>

                <p>Irradiation, Schistosoma metabolism Ultra-violet and gamma-irradiation attenuates
                    cercariae, and can render them highly immunogenic. The objective of our work is
                    to attempt to explain enhanced immunogenicity in biochemical terms. We have
                    found that irradiation promptly inhibits glycoprotein and nucleic acid
                    synthesis, has a less pronounced effect on phospholipid synthesis, but does not
                    alter protein phosphorylation or triglyceride synthesis. We show how such
                    metabolic changes can lead to the persistence of altered conformations of some
                    surface associated epitopes. A striking feature of the metabolic effects of
                    irradiation is that the extent of inhibition varies from batch to batch of
                    cercariae. This variability appears to be a fundamental feature of cercariae and
                    may have profound consequences for both the induction of protective immunity and
                    for the ability of the immunised host to kill challenge cercariae 130 S2.C -

                    of Wales, Aberystwyth, SY23 3DA, U.K.</p>
                <p>Cysteine thioether, cystathionine B-synthase, nematodes.</p>
                <p>In mammals, the synthesis of the cysteine thioether cystathionine is exclusively
                    cata- lysed by cystathionine-B-Synthase (EC 4.2.1.22), a key enzyme in the
                    pathway of cysteine biosynthesis from dietary methionine. The same enzyme
                    catalyses the reversible con- version of cysteine to serine and H,S (the so
                    called "serine sulphydrase" reaction). In addition to catalysing the above
                    reactions, a range of gastro-intestinal, free-living and entomogenous nematodes
                    can catalyse a novel B-replacement reaction between cysteine and a specific
                    hydroxyl containing thiol, forming the corresponding cysteine thioether and H,S.
                    Using Nippostrongylus brasiliensis and Trichostrongylus colubriformis, the
                    enzymes responsible for the "serine sulphydrase" and novel B-replacement
                    reactions have been separated via gel filtration chromatography and partially
                    characterised.</p>
                <p>Substrate specificity studies revealed that although both enzymes catalysed
                    cystathion- ine synthesis, there were no other mutual catalytic roles.
                    Additionally, the physical and biochemical properties of the nematode "serine
                    sulphydrase" catalysing enzyme were found to resemble very closely those of
                    mammalian cystathionine B-synthase, whilst the enzyme catalysing the novel
                    B-replacement reactions varied considerably from the mammalian type enzyme with
                    respect to native molecular weight, subunit structure, iso- enzyme profile and
                    response to limited proteolysis. These results are consistent with the existence
                    of both a mammalian type cystathionine B-synthase and a novel, variant form of
                    this enzyme in nematodes.</p>

                <p>S2.C 68 P.+0 HIGH AFFINITY UPTAKE OF CHOLINE BY TISSUES OF HYMENOLEPIS DIMINUTA
                    RODNEY A. (EBB CHOLINE, TRANSPORT, ION GRADIENTS, CESTODE, H. DIMINUTA The
                    transport of choline into tissue slices of the cestode H. diminuta in vitro was
                    assessed by following the uptake of [$H] choline. Uptake of [$H]choline from a 4
                    x 1076M solution in balanced saline was linear for 20 minutes. The initial
                    uptake of [$H]choline at concentrations varying from 0.025 M to 7 M displayed
                    two components: one sodium dependent and another which was sodium independent.
                    The rate of uptake of choline by the sodium independent component was directly
                    proportional to the concentration of the externally applied choline. The sodium
                    dependent uptake was not linear, and Lineweaver-Burk transformation of the data
                    produced a straight line (r2=0.94) with a Kt estimate of 2.0 M and V max of 460
                    fmoles/mg tissue/min. The Kt suggests a high affinity uptake mechanism. The
                    sodium-dependent uptake was directly dependent upon the magnitude of the sodium
                    gradient, and was inhibited by low or high concentrations of K*. Neither the
                    sodium-dependent nor the sodium- independent uptake systems were C1 or S04”
                    dependent. Ouabaïin, which abolished the sodium gradient, significantly reduced
                    the sodium dependent uptake, as did several cholinergic receptor antagonists,
                    several acetylcholinesterase inhibitors, and hemicholinium-3. Reversal of the
                    sodium gradient in slices preloaded with choline and sodium promoted efflux. The
                    data collectively suggested that transport of choline into tissue slices is
                    directly dependent upon the sodium gradient as the sole driving force, and that
                    HA choline transport is mediated by a symmetrical carrier.</p>

                    and transmission electron miscroscopy. The body of G. epinepheli comprises two
                    clearly defined regions, vis. a short and free forebody and an extensively long
                    hindbody tangled in the meshwork of fibrous capsule of host origin. The surface
                    topography of the forebody is highly pitted bearing numerous pore-like
                    structures, possibly glandualr openings. In contrast, the hindbody is relatively
                    smooth bearing conspicuous transverse annulations and few scattered pores.</p>
                <p>The tegumental unit of the didymozoid is similar in structure to that of the

                    to its disruption.</p>

                <p>Gastrodiscoïides - Trematoda - lymph system - ultrastructure Gastrodiscoides
                    hominis is a common digenean parasite of the caecum and colon of man and pigs in
                    India. Despite its medical and veterinary importance, little îs known about the
                    function of its tegument and even less about the role played by its lymphatic
                    system. The aîm of this study was to examine the functional fine structure of
                    the lymphatic system, using electron microscopy and histochemical techniques.
                    The lymph system comprises numerous sub-dividing lateral branches which ramify
                    throughout the body, forming intimate associations with the various organ
                    systems. LM and TEM studies have revealed that the lymph fluid consists of an
                    amorphous, proteinaceous matrix with free-floating nuclei and granules of
                    various sizes. The lymph vessels are delimited by a unit membrane which forms
                    tight junctions with the parenchymal membranes and, in places, protrudes into
                    the tegument, giving rise to finger-like extensions of lymph in the base of the
                    surface syncytium. The lymph system is probably involved in storage and
                    mobilization of amino acids, and possibly the transport of smaller molecules
                    throughout the body. The detection of haemoglobin in the lymph fluid suggests a
                    further role in oxygen storage and transport.</p>

                <p>Le dékystement in vitro de G. intestinalis d'origine humaine a été étudié en
                    microscopie électronique à balayage et en transmission. Les kystes, purifiés par
                    des flottations au saccharose 0,75 M, sont mis à incuber dans une solution acide
                    de pepsine (Bingham et Meyer, 1979), puis placés dans un milieu, HSP3 modifié
                    (Chochillon et al., 1987), favorisant une libération rapide des trophozoïtes.
                    Chaque étape du dékystement est fixée dans une solution à 1% de glutaraldéhyde.
                    Le dékystement débute par une individualisation du trophozoïte vis-à-vis de la
                    paroi du kyste suivie de la rupture de cette paroi à l'un des pôles. On observe
                    un relachement progressif du réseau de microfibrilles qui compose la paroi du
                    kyste, la formation de nombreuses petites vésicules entre le trophozoïte et la
                    paroi du kyste et l'apparition de vacuolés denses aux électrons dans la
                    périphérie du cytoplasme du trophozoïte. En sortant, le trophozoïte abandonne
                    derrière lui la paroi du kyste vide. Bien que les flagelles soient déjà
                    individualisés le trophozoïte d'aspect globuleux, ne présente pas encore sa
                    morphologie habituelle. Les caractères morphologiques classiques vont apparaître
                    lors de la division cellulaire qui survient dans les minutes suivant la sortie.
                    Ce travail a permis d'un point de vue morphologique de suivre et de détailler
                    pour la première fois l'ensemble des étapes du dékystement de G.

                    Oncospheral envelopes, Sobolevicanthus gracilis, TEM Cysticercoids of
                    Sobolevicanthus gracilis from naturally infected Hetero- cypris incongruens
                    /Ostracoda/ were used for controlled infestation of Anas platyrhynchos dom..
                    Fragments of gravid proglottides of the tapeworm obtained during dissection of
                    the final host were processed according to the standard methods of TEM and
                    ultrastructure of oncospheres within ute- rus was analyzed. Simultaneously, the
                    ability of larvae to infect interme- diate hosts was examined. Two primary
                    envelopes: outer and inner could be distinguished around each oncosphere. The
                    cytoplasmic layers create secon- dary envelopes: shell, embryophore and
                    oncospheral "membrane". The assvn- chronism of larval development is also
                    visible: fully formed hooks appear prior to the definite formation of the
                    secondary envelopes. However, the ultrastructure of the outermost layers is
                    peculiarly interesting in Sobole- vicanthus gracilis. The outer envelope is
                    granular, not disintegrating la- yer, and its derivative, shell, is folded in
                    little only. The shell beca- mes smooth, when the larvae are released from
                    proglottides in water.</p>
                <p>Although the oncospheres assume then globular shape, the shell limits their
                    sizes. The larvae remain small and heavy in comparison with these of other
                    Hymenolepididae species, possessin: very folded shell. It seems to reflect a
                    relation between oncospheral ultrastructure of Sobolevicanthus gracilis and the
                    habitat of its intermedialte hosts, benthic ostracods.</p>

                    parvogenitalis, Diorchis stefañski from Anas platyrhynchos, all from natural
                    infections, were processed according to the standard electron microscopy
                    methods. The ultrathin sections were exa- mined in JEM 74 /JEOL/.</p>
                <p>The oncospheral envelopes of Diorchis tapeworms only in part are formed in a
                    manner similar to that of other Hymenolepididae. Differences are particu- larly
                    clear in case of the inner oncospheral envelope, ultrastructure of which
                    suggests a high metabolic activity. It was visible in all examined Diorchis
                    species that within the layer three secondary envelopes are cre- ated: striated
                    oncospheral ‘"membrane", bi-layered embryophore and zone of electron-dense
                    blocks. The last layer has a peculiar localization and ultrastructure, and it
                    has been not observed in the other tapeworms exami- ned so far.</p>
                <p>Because the similarity exists in the envelope ultrastructure of four Diorchis
                    species, in spite of the differences in the habitat.of their intermediate hosts,
                    we suggest that the structure and distribution of inner envelope derivatives are
                    unique and genus specific for Diorchis tapeworms.</p>

                <p>Microphallidae, Gynaecotyle, Sperm, Cirrus sac Microphallid trematodes frequently
                    have complex copulatory structures. G. adunca has a highly developed atrial
                    papilla, a modified cirrus sac, and a different kind of sperm. The sperm has an
                    enlarged “head” while most trematodes have filamentous sperm. [Schistosoma
                    mansoni has sperm with an enlarged “head”.] In G. adunca, sperm move away from
                    the testes “tail” first in the vas efferens. The teardrop shaped nucleus is up
                    to 700 nm wide and more than 2400 nm long. Two axonemes are present, each about
                    200 nm in diameter. The “9 + 1” configuration of microtubules has a central core
                    as seen in other worms. $. mansoni lacks the core, thusit is “9 + 0”. One
                    axoneme extends along side the nucleus when it is 250 nm wide. Mature sperm as
                    seen within the egg are similar to those found in the seminal vesicle. Live
                    sperm are highly motile, but the direction of movement could not be
                    determined.</p>
                <p>The cirrus sac is large, arcuate adjacent to the dorsal tegument curving to open
                    in the anterior side of the genital atrium. The sac is surrounded by a muscular
                    capsule about 1 pm thick. Extrinsic muscles are attached to the capsule.
                    Prostate cells are present between the seminal vesicle and the capsule. Gland
                    cells produce vesicles of four kinds: I. Electron dense, 0.7-1.2 pm, Il.
                    Electron lucent, 0.5-1.25 pm, II. Granular contents, 0.5-1.1 pm, IV. Clear

                    The masses of heterochromatin usually observed attached to the internal nuclear
                    membrane in the interphase nucleus, become less evident and remain during the
                    course of the process. It is relevant the role played by the nucleolus, whose
                    fibrilar and granular components are segregated. At metaphase, small
                    electrondense clumps of nucleolar material migrates along the microtubules (MTs)
                    toward the poles. Structures as centrioles, polar bodies or electron dense sites
                    for the anchorage or polimerization of MTs are not observed. The MTs emerge from
                    the fibrilar zone of the nucleolus and project to both poles protruding into the
                    cytoplasm covered by the nuclear envelope. We propose that during division the
                    nucleolus behaves as a Microtubule Organizing Center. The only type of MTs
                    observed, the pole-pole, are positive to acetylated tubulin antibody as assesed
                    by immunofluorescence.</p>
                <p>Loosed clumps of chromatin of different sizes are segregated to the poles by the
                    elongation of the nucleus and a MTs sliding mechanism. There are not condensed
                    chromosomes. Cisterns of rough endoplasmic reticulum (RER) are present around
                    the mid-body in the late anaphase. The presence of subpelicular MTs establish a
                    special problem in relation to the mechanism of cytokinesis. We found that the
                    cytokinesis takes place by polimerization of two parallel new chaîns of MTs
                    along the flagellar pocket with the plasma membrane between them, until
                    "fenestrae" appears, separating the daughter cells by a zipper effect. The
                    presence of RER along the forming MTs indicates the possible role of Ca£* in the
                    dynamic process of assembly and disassembly of MTs in cell division.</p>

                <p>Digenea of Amphibia, surface topography Scanning electron microscopic studies on
                    the surface fine topo- graphy of three digenean species, each representing a
                    different location in the host, Rana cyanophlyctis, revealed features that seem
                    to be of adaptive value. Ganeo tigrinum, the intestine-dwel- ling fluke,
                    possessed a densely spinous surface which ensures a firm anchorage and lessens
                    the chances of getting dislodged from its position in a lumenal, physically
                    hostile habitat. The lung fluke, Haematoloechus almorai displayed a non-spiny
                    surface with irregular foldings of the tegument; domed papillae were present in
                    the vicinity of oral and ventral suckers and button-like patches, sparsely
                    scattered in between the folds; minute pits abounding in between the folds
                    probably bring about an interchange within the microenvironment. Gorgoderina
                    ellipticuñ, occupying the urinary bladder, also had a non-spinous tegument;
                    domed aciliate papillae were scantily scattered around the suckers, while
                    nearing the posterior extremity, the surface had an uneven pitted contour with
                    numerous pit-like depressions. Lungs and urinary bladder perhaps offer a
                    physically, relatively less hostile environment to their parasites.</p>

                    gonad of the mussel, are des- cribed.</p>
                <p>For the study in TEM, the material has been submitted to the conventional
                    protocol: dou- ble fixation in paraformaldehide-glutaraldehide and Os0,,
                    inclusion in Spurr resin, and the ultrathin sections have been stained with
                    uranyl acetate and lead cytrate. For the study in SEM, the material, and then to
                    the double fixation, were metalized with gold by means of the ''sputtering''
                    technique after a previous treatment with liquid CO, and poste- rior elevation
                    of the temperature and the pressure to the critical point. 2 The sensilla
                    studied corresponds to the common model described in other Platyhelmints. In
                    section, it shows à bulbar cytoplasm, which joints with the tegumentary adjacent
                    cytoplasm by septate junctions, and in which apical pole, a lonely cilium is
                    seen. On the surface, the sensilla appears as a protuberance with an alveolus
                    from where the cilium emerges.</p>
                <p>In the first stages of development, the bulbar cytoplasm of the future sensilla,
                    is placed under the basal membrane ot the tegument; cytoplasmic
                    electrodensifications flank the in- tercellular space between this membrane and
                    the apical membrane of the bulb. This space increases at the same time as the
                    supradjacent tegumentary cytoplasm narrows until it di- sappears. The cilium is
                    found at this tegumentary cavity during its differentiation and development,
                    becoming longer while the tegument of the developing cercaria increases in
                    thickness. While the cilium begins its differentiation, septate junctions are
                    now seen, and the number of septa increases in the course of this.</p>

                    and 4) monitoring of the excystation process by scanning electron microscopy.
                    The excystation process was asynchronous. The first sign of excystment appeared
                    a few minutes after incubation in culture medium as a protrusion of flagella
                    trough a cyst pen at one pole of the cyst. Subsequently, the flagella and the
                    cell body of the trophozoite emerged progressively from the cyst envelope. The
                    newly emerged trophozoite underwent cytokinesis starting at the anterior area of
                    the cell body. Finally, daughter cells acquired the characteristic morphological
                    and structural features of mature trophozoites. Cell surface components were
                    studied at the earliest stages of development by means of cationic dyes to
                    evaluate the changes of surface charge of the parasite during maturation. The
                    cyst wall and the cell surface of the newly emerged trophozoite were positive to
                    ruthenium red and bound cationized ferritin particles. The progressive
                    structural development of the surface coat was documented, as well as the
                    possible participation of cytoplasmic elements in the assembly of the cyst
                    wall.</p>

                    out on following animals: 155 sheep, 174 cows, 28 horses, 1157 porkers and 320
                    sows. The active substance of Butox, a drug of the Roussel Uclaf Company, is a
                    pyrethroid-Deltamethrin. The drug was used in the shape of 5 per cent solution
                    and as 0.75 per cent solution for "pour on" application. The animals were
                    infected with following parasites: Pso- roptes ovis - 85 sheep, Melophagus
                    ovinus - 70 sheep, Sarcoptes suis - 455 pigs, Haematopinus suis - 702 pigs, H.
                    eurysternus - 89 calves and 174 cows.</p>
                <p>At 28 horses Butox was used against flies. In a concentration of 12.5 ppm, after
                    one treatment the drug was highly effective against louses and in a
                    concentration of 25 ppm against Melophagus ovinus. ifter using a concentra- tion
                    of 50 ppm the sheep infected with Psoroptes and pigs infected with Sarcoptes,
                    after two treatment, in 8-10 days interval were completly curred.</p>
                <p>The"pour on" shape was highly effective against flies by horses and louses by
                    cows. The influence of Butox on the production results was analysed. The milk
                    production of treated cows was 4.5 per cent higher compared with non treated
                    animals. The daily weight gain of treated porkers was about 30 g and of treated
                    piglets was 50 g higher than in the control group. The feed consumption of
                    treated porkers was about 230 g and of treated calves 42 g lower per kg of body
                    weight compared with non treated animals.</p>

                    male Kyoto rat infected with 100 cysticercoids. Parasites were washed twice in
                    Medium M199 containing antibiotics and transferred in 50 ul of medium to wells
                    of a micro- titre plate. To each well was added 25 ul of heat-inactivated normal
                    rat serum and 25 ul of either fresh normal mouse serum (fNMS) or immune serum
                    (fIMS) from mice that had been infected with H. microstoma 4, 6, 8, and 10 weeks
                    previously. In addition, some assays contained heat-inactivated immune serum
                    from a 10 week infection.</p>
                <p>Assays were carried out at 37°C and parasites processed for electron microscopy
                    after 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 24 and 48 hours. Light microscopical and
                    ultrastructural observations revealed that presumed immune precipitates did not
                    form on the surface of either hymenolepid species exposed to fNMS. In contrast,
                    a homogenuous precipitate was noted within the microthrix border of the scolex
                    of H. microstoma after 0.5 h culture in fIMS. With increasing time in culture
                    the precipitate comprised membrane fragments and shed microtriches and extended
                    over the strobila. In H. diminuta precipitates were only revealed after 2 hours
                    culture and was not as extensive as that on H. microstoma. Studies on the
                    formation of the precipitate on different ages and species of hymenolepid
                    species are in progress.</p>

                <p>Most commonly, these receptors have been described from the scolex, with Little

                <p>The structure of sensory receptors from the terminal genitalia of the
                    cyclophyllidean cestode Çylindrotaenia hickmani (Jones, 1985) was studied using
                    transmission electron microscopy. Ciliated receptors line the proximal tegument
                    of the genital atrium. Each receptor possesses a single clavate cilium,
                    electron-dense collar, septate desmosome, and basal body with ciliary rootlet.
                    Ciliated receptors are also observed among microtriches that line proximal
                    regions of the cirrus. These receptors are similar to those of the genital
                    atrium but differ in having a slightly more elongate cilium. The precise
                    functions of these receptors could not be determined in this ultrastructural
                    study. The receptors are located within organs associated with copulation,
                    however, and it is postulated that they are chemo- or tango-receptors involved
                    in the control and modulation of copulatory activity in this species.</p>

                    reproduction; embryogenesis The viviparous monogeneans, the gyrodactylids,
                    reproduce by a form of “polyembryony". The ultrastructure of the early stages of
                    embryogenesis was studied in a species of Gyrodactylus from commercially
                    available gotdfish. The egg cell (= oôcyte ?) within the egg cell forming region
                    (= seminal receptacle ?) is a Large cell that contains a Large nucleus.</p>
                <p>Prominent features of these egg cells are distinctive nuclear inclusions that Lie
                    near a centrally located nucleolus. These inclusions, observed also in
                    differentiating egg cells in embryos, are excellent ultrastructural markers for
                    tracing germ cells in developing embryos.</p>
                <p>The egg cell forming region consists of an outer cellular layer that surrounds
                    both egg cell and a thin layer of tissue that disappears as the egg cell grows.
                    The outer cellular layer bears along its internal plasma membrane numerous
                    electron dense zones. Sperm are found within the cytoplasm of the outer layer;
                    it appears that sperm pass through this cellular Layer towards the egg cell. Our
                    observations on the developing egg cell and egg cell forming region suggest that
                    early embrogenesis in gyrodactylids is exceedingly complex and support the
                    notion that the Gyrodactyloidea occupy a unique position in the Monogenea.</p>

                    Plasmodium berghei - Na‘/H*-exchange - gametogenesis - DNA synthesis -
                    intracellular pH The role of ionic regulation in the induction of gametogenesis
                    of P. berghei at 20 C was investi- gated. À potent inhibitor of Na*/H* exchange,
                    amiloride, strongly inhibited exflagellation and subsequent ookinete formation
                    induced by RPMI-1640 with 10% fetal calf serum at pH 8.0, whereas Nat or K*
                    channel inhibitors, H*'-AlPase inhibitors and a protonophore (CCCP) had no
                    significant effect. Amiloride-treated ’activated’ microgametocytes synthesized
                    DNA to levels consistent with the expected 8C, but failed to devlope further.
                    This indicates that alkalinization of the infected erythrocytes and gametocytes
                    may be necessary for subsequent developmental events in gametogenesis, e.g.
                    flagellar formation. Measurement of intracellular pHi of the infected
                    erythrocytes by a saponin-lysis method revealed that cultivation at pH 8.0
                    resulted in an increase in pHi of about 0.48 units when compared to incubation
                    at the non-permissive condition at pH 7.3.</p>
                <p>These results may suggest that an increase in pHi induced by Na*/H* exchange
                    plays an important role for the induction of gametogenesis. Additionally,
                    exflagellation occurred in a simple medium composed of buffered saline with 10mM
                    glucose. Glucose was indispensable for exflage- 1lation presumably acting as an
                    energy source. Exflagellation induced by this solution was also inhibited by
                    amiloride. It is therefore suggested that the induction of microgametogenesis
                    may be composed of two distinct mechanisms, one is a temperature-dependent DNA
                    synthesis and the other is a pH-dependent control of developmental events
                    leading to microgamete assembly and exflagellation.</p>

                    CsC1, RdCI, NaBr, KBr, NaN03, and Choline-Cl were effective in inducing
                    exflagellation with equal efficiency to NaCl, whereas NaF, NaN0O2, NaSCN,
                    Na2HP04, Na2S04, NaH2P04, Nal, KHCO3, KI, K2HP04 nor isotonic sucrose were
                    ineffective. On the other hand, mixtures (1:1) of KHC03 with each of -Na?5S04,
                    Na?HP04, NaH2P04 or NaN02 re-established exflagellation, showing that the

                    CsCl or RdCl synergistically accelerated exflag- ellation rates when compared to
                    each salt alone. These results indicate that two different anion exhangers,
                    i.e., Na*-dependent HC037/C17 exchanger and Na*-independent C17/X(unknown)-
                    exchanger may be activated, in addition to cation/H* exchanger, by cultivating
                    at pH 8.0. Exflagellation induced by these solutions were also inhibited by
                    amiloride or specific inhibitors of anion ex- change such as DIDS, SITS and
                    ethacrynic acid, implying that activation of two anion-exchangers and cation/H*
                    exchanger may result in an increase in the pHi of gametocytes, and then induce
                    ex- flagellation. In fact, addition of NH4CI, an agent which increases pHi in
                    many cells without any change of external pH, significantly enhanced
                    exflagellation rate at the non-permissive pH of 7.3.</p>

                    homo-,heterotransplantation, host response The role of varying defence envelopes
                    of larval helminths in evoiding the host response has been studied, using the
                    homotransplantetion (gammarus-gemmarus) of acentellae, cyclocercs, as well as
                    heterotrans- plantation (oligochaetes-gemmarus) of other forms of cysticercoids:
                    floricercs, monocercs, diplocysts. Capsule-free acantellae have been found to
                    cause no cellular response in recipients. The trensplentation of exocysts-free
                    cyclocercs was followed by encapsulation. The forma- tion of capsules occurred
                    due to the heterotransplantation of other modifications of cysticercoids as
                    well. The cellular response and me- lanization were found to constently occur in
                    the evagination canal.</p>
                <p>A11 this resulted in the widening of cysticercoids cavity, a temporary activity
                    of the scolex and larveal death typically in about 3-9 days after the
                    transplantation. Electron micrographs of the tail surface showed the formation
                    of "bushy'" microvilli as well as the ‘presence of secreted membrane material at
                    their tops. The same phenomenon was found to take place at the homologs of
                    microtriches at the cystic tegu- ments. The secretion rate appeared to depend on
                    the state of glycoca- lux and was highly enhanced efter its denaturation, using
                    a short-term treatment with 70% alcohol. The above membrane material
                    disintegreted the host cells which resulted in the formation of a chink-shaped
                    cavity between the cyst and its cepsule. In the process of evolution, all this
                    can facilitate the larval settling in a non-specific host.</p>

                    surveys to determine helminth populations. This community consisted of different
                    morphological types of bacteria including some of which were filamentous. The
                    development of one of these filaments is described.</p>
                <p>Scanning and transmission electron microscopy were used to examine the adherence
                    and in situ morphology of this organism attached to its cyathostome host.</p>
                <p>Standard methods of preparation were employed.</p>
                <p>This organism is a smooth-walled or continuous multicellular filament and the
                    following developmental cycle is proposed. Filament growth commences either with
                    the attachment of a cylindrical initiating cell to the cuticle of the
                    cyathostome or growth of this cell from a complex germinating source on the
                    cuticle. This cell elongates by the addition of intercellularly formed septa (or
                    disc-shaped elements).</p>
                <p>When these septa undergo further division in a plane perpendicular to the
                    existing septa, numerous rod-shaped units result giving rise to a multicellular
                    filament bound by a common cell wall. The older filaments release these units
                    which attach to the cyathostome cuticle and may act in a reproductive capacity.
                    This is the first report of the development of such a continuous multicellular
                    filament and contributes to our basic understanding of this microbial community:

                    ...) a amené les auteurs à reprendre l'étude de ces parasites à la recherche de
                    processus de cytogamie. Le modèle choisi concerne des promastigotes de culture
                    (milieu NNN), formes voisines de celles observées au cours du cycle

                    adjoint un procédé d'enregistrement vidéo cinématographique permettant de garder
                    la trace de la fusion cellulaire. La formation d'un ‘'zygomastigote" a été

                    total of 10 domestic dog and cats were infected with alveolar hydatid cysts from
                    white mice which had been given alveolar cysts from naturally infected Myospalax
                    fontanerei in the endemic area of Linxia, Narthwest China, and the mature adult
                    of E._multilocularis were obtained. Using those gravid segments and eggs
                    collected from both hosts reinfected to mice,and the mature alveolar hydatid
                    cysts were recao- vered. The eggs of E. multilocularis were first seen in dog
                    feces 39 days after in- fection , but the peak number of eggs were found within
                    60-90 days. It was found that the most of adults mainly occured in the small
                    intestine of both hosts. From a dog in autopsy at 39 days after infection, there
                    were 1257 worms in the ileum, 957 in the jejunum, and 895 in the duodenum.
                    Besides, the post-mortem made on a cat in- fected by 15 days, 717 adults were
                    seen in the ileum, 611 in the jejunum and 503 in the duodenum. After comparison
                    between the adult numbers, the egg numbers in the uterous, the successtive time
                    of eggs expelled and the status of adults developed in both hosts, it was
                    obviously demostrated that the dog was better final host than cat. The
                    tissue-chemistry studies showed that the medulla of adult and its protosc- olex
                    were the main places for presservation of glycogen. The rostellum, suckers,
                    testis, vitelline gland, uterous wall, egg embryo and the cuticular, germinal
                    lay- ers of fertile and sterile cysts also had glycogen in plenty, but the
                    ovary, roste- llar hooks and egg shell were absent of glycogen. There were rich
                    polysaccharide and mucin in the rostellum, suckers, muscles, excretory canal,
                    calcareous corpusc- les and egg embryo, but it was less in testis and lacked in
                    the egg shell.</p>

                    problem on sea-farmed salmonids in Atlantic Canada. The infective copepodid
                    larvae locate their hosts using various sensory structures which have been
                    examined in the present study. Copepodid larvae of Caligus elongatus were fixed
                    in Karnovsky's fixative and processed by traditional methods for transmission
                    and scanning electron microscopy. The pigmented photoreceptors in the anterior
                    end respond to increasing light intensities which makes infection most likely to
                    occur in the upper waters of the sea cages. Copevodids are chemically attracted
                    to their hosts and use chemoreceptors around the mouth to locate fish.
                    Feather®like filaments at the posterior end of the body appear to affect
                    bouyancy and may be effective in water currents carrying larvae to fish. It is
                    believed that host infection is a result of a combination of active and passive
                    behavioural traits of the larvae.</p>

                    not been reported from Finland. Lungs of ten yearlings and ten adult reindeer
                    Rangifer tarandus tarandus L. from the eastern part of the Finnish Lapland were
                    examined. Small Dictyocaulus sp. was extracted from the lungs.</p>
                <p>The male was 1600 wm long and 35 um wide. The copulatory bursa had 2 ventral, 3
                    lateral and 2 dorsal rays. The spikules were like those of Dictyocaulus spp.,
                    almost symmetrical and of the same length (80 m).</p>
                <p>The female was 1500-1900 yum long and 30-35 im wide on the middle.</p>
                <p>The anterior end was spherical and about 20 yum in diameter. The mouth was a
                    united ring, 4 Am in diameter and without lips. Vulva was in the beginning of
                    the posterior half of the worm. The caudal end was successively narrowing into a
                    rounded end. Anus was situ- ated about 50 yum from the tip. The phasmids were
                    distinct. The cuticula had thin disconnected longitudinal ridges. The distance
                    between the ridges varied between 0.5-1.0 1m. Other morphological details will
                    be shown and a name will be proposed for this Dicty- ocaulus sp.</p>

                    intestinalis in vitro was investigated.</p>
                <p>The drug dissolved in dimethylsulfoxide was adjusted with culture medium to
                    concentration of 1 yug/ml. This stock solution was added to bile-supplemented
                    TYI-S-33 medium to obtain a desired concentration of the drug. In experiments,
                    100 000 parasites of Portland 1 strain of G. intestinalis were used as inoculum.
                    À 24 hr exposure to the drug at concentrations of 50-500 ng/m1, resulted in
                    detachment of cultured trophozoïites. At concentration 50 ng/ml the effect of
                    albendazole was reversible. The parasites unable to adhere in the presence of
                    the drug readily produced a monolayer when transferred to drug-free medium. The
                    parasites exposed to 500 ng/ml albendazole lost their motility within 48 hrs and
                    died thereafter.</p>
                <p>The organisms maintained under drug pressure (100 ng/ml) showed profound
                    structural changes resulting from defective cytokinesis and alteration of

                    fragments of ventral disc were observed, composed of disorganized arrays of
                    microtubules with attached dorsal ribbons similar to those present in Giardia

                    Ultrastructural observations were made on gametogenesis, fertilization and the
                    sporogonic development of Haemogregarina balli, a parasite of snapping turtles
                    (Chelydra gerpentina), in the intestine of the presumed leech vector Placobdella
                    ornata, for a period of 30 days post-feeding (PF).</p>
                <p>All developmental stages were situated within a parasitophorous vacuole (PV),
                    which was formed by the fusion of intestinal microvilli with a pre-existing
                    membrane external to the gametocyte. The parasites were surrounded by a single
                    dense layer within the PV; macrogametes did not have wall-forming bodies.</p>
                <p>Microgametogenesis occurred within 12 days PF generating four aflagellate
                    microgametes. Fertilization was observed between 14 and 17 days PF. Sporogony
                    involved sultiplication of the genetic material, mitochondria and Golgi
                    apparatus; organelles of the apical complex were synthesized de novo. Mature
                    oocysts containing eight sporozoites were detected by 21 days PF. The
                    sporozoites were typically apicomplexan except for the lack of paranuclear or
                    crystalloid bodies. The ultrastructural data refute reports based solely on
                    light microscopy that epicellular development is also extracellular. The
                    mechanisa of attachaent of gametes to intestinal cells appeared to differ from
                    that utilized by species of Cryptosporidium and Epieimeria, and may be a common
                    feature among haemogregarines. Completion of sporogonic development in P. ornata
                    suggests that this leech is a potential vector for H. balli.</p>

                    vitro as well as those of L.jaculum colonizing the intestine of the bug Nepe
                    cinerea,was studied by means of light and electron microscopy. The flagellates
                    of all these species can form rosettes of two structural ty- pes. In the centre
                    of type I rosettes (L.peterhoffi) long tangled fla- gella with goffered plasma
                    membranes can be seen. No specialized cell contacts between flagella of
                    L.peterhoffi and flagella and cell bodies of the adjacent parasites are seen. In
                    type II rosettes, formed by P.in- constans,.L.jaculum and L.mycophilus, the
                    flagella are getting shorter to form numerous outgrowths. Desmosomes are found
                    between adjacent flagella in the rosettes of :decutun.Henidesmosomes are visible
                    in the places of contact of the flagella with the extracellular vesicles and
                    membranes inside the rosettes of P.inconstans.Some of these vesicles,100-150 nm
                    in diameter,are formed by deteachment from the surface of the enlarged fla-
                    gella into the centre of rosettes of P.ïinconstans.The rosettes of L.my-
                    cophilus are connected with the production of cyst-like bodies.The lat- ter ere
                    formed by gradual divisions,condensation and shrinkage of the rosette-making

                    feeding and multiplication of the trypanosomatids, but also for the induction of
                    differentiation of the transmission stages of these parasites.</p>

                    cell structure was studied with the cnpÉs ele on the mitochondrie and lysosomal
                    system (LS). Simultaneously the oxy- gen consumption rate was measured on the
                    isolated mitochondria fraction by the polarography method in control and

                    the cytoskeleton of F. hepatica has received little attention.</p>
                <p>Spermatogenesis provides a good mel For such studies as it involves cell division
                    and microtubule-based sperm formation. Tissue slices of F. hepatica were treated
                    for up to 12 h in vitro with the microfilament-disrupting drug cytochalasin B
                    (100 ug/ml), and the microtubute-disrupting drug tubulozole (0.5448 ug/ml).
                    Following treatment, the testes were examined using TEM. Cytochalasin B severely
                    disrupted cytokinesis of the various cell stages, leading to the presence of
                    numerous binucleate 10 spermatogonia and multinucleate cells belonging to
                    subsequent spermatogonial and spermatocyte stages. Nuclear division, both
                    mitotic and meiotic, appears to continue, resulting in a syncytial mass,
                    corresponding to the 32-cell spermatid stage.</p>
                <p>Spermiogenesis also continues, but axoneme development and nuclear migration is
                    disorientated, leading to the formation of abnormal spermatozoa. Treatment with
                    tubulozole resulted in halting of spermatogenesis early in the developmental
                    sequence, with most cells in the testis follicle being spermatogonial. There are
                    few cells in rosette formation and those that are joined show signs of
                    disruption of the cytophore and autophagy in the cytoplasm. Spermiogenesis,
                    beginning at the spermatid stage in the normal sequence, appears to be blocked
                    early after drug treatment. Development of the sperm comes to a virtual
                    standstill, with the result that there are few spermatozoa in the testis lumen.
                    The results suggest that microfilaments and microtubules play important roles in
                    spermatogenesis in the liver fluke, and that their disruption offers a possible
                    taraet for anthelmintic attack.</p>

                    oncospheral morphogenesis in the anoplocephalid cestode Üochoristica aqga- mae.
                    Adult specimens of 0. agamae were obtained from the intestines of the African
                    snake Thelothornis kirtlandii collected in the Swiss Centre for Scientific
                    Research in Ivory Coast. Samples of tissue were fixed for 6 hrs in 4%
                    glutaraldehyde, postfixed in Os04 and routinely prepared for TEM. The pattern of
                    blastomere differentiation, formation of em- bryonic tegument, development of
                    oncospheral glands and muscles, formation of oncospheral hooks and their
                    musculature, differentiation of somatic and germinative cells were exami- ned.
                    The general pattern of oncospheral morphogenesis in 0. agamae resembles that
                    descri- bed in other cestodes. Minor differences exist in: (1) the development
                    of oncospheral glands; (2) number of major types of oncospheral cells; and (3)
                    the mode of formation of embryonic tegument which originates in 0. agamae from a
                    syncytial, 3-nuclear complex, re- sulting probably from 2 incomplete cell
                    divisions.The number of embryonic cells slightly decreases during late
                    differentiation, as some of the blastomeres degenerate at the end of this stage.
                    The total number of nuclei in the mature oncospheres of 0. agamae varies between
                    40 and 42.</p>

                    circular contour, has a thick cuticular rim that bears a leaf crown comprising
                    80-85 minute conical elements. Four cephalic papillae are promi- nently seen
                    lodged in between the six cuticular thickenings surrounding the mouth. Emerging

                <p>The small bursa in male is supported by stumpy rays that have relatively broad
                    rounded tips. The cloacal aperture is slit like, situated subventrallÿ between
                    the lateral processes and guarded anteriorly by a flap.</p>
                <p>The energy dispersive X-ra” analysis of the buccal tecth revealed the presence of
                    sulphur and calcium, while zinc and copper were also detectable. The presence of
                    sulphur is sugges- tive of a keratin-like protuin, which is also known to occur
                    in the cuticle of neimatodes.</p>

                    morphology, Polyopisthocotylea, adult Bychowsky (1957) suggested that two pairs
                    of pigment-shielded photoreceptors may be the primitive, ancestral condition in
                    the Monogenea. Furthermore, Liewellyn (1963) made a distinction between
                    oncomiracidia in the Monopisthocotylea and the diclidophoridean
                    Polyopisthocotylea; namely, those with two pairs of pigment-shielded
                    photoreceptors, with crystalline lenses, that persist in the adult and those
                    with one pair of pigment- shielded photoreceptors, without crystalline lenses,
                    that do not persist in the adult, respectively. In the oncomiracidium of
                    Diplozoon paradoxum, Kearn (1978) demonstrated ultrastructural evidence of one
                    pair of pigment-shïelded as well as one pair of nonpigment-shielded
                    photoreceptors. This finding is significant for it lends doubt to the
                    distinction of photoreceptor numbers in these two groups (Kearn, 1978). In adult
                    polyopisthocotyleans, little is known about photoreceptor ontogeny, morphology,
                    or phototaxic behavior. The present research details ultrastructural evidence of
                    one pair of nonpigment-shielded, rhabdomeric photoreceptors that persists in
                    ovigerous specimens of Microcotyle sebastis. These photoreceptors consist of
                    intact microvilli surrounding a single retinuTar cell; no remnants of a pigment
                    shield or melanin granules were present in any sections. This finding is of
                    significant importance for it illustrates the need for closer examination of
                    both the oncomiracidium and adult of those polyopisthocotyleans that have been
                    previously described as having one pair of pigment-shielded photoreceptors or
                    completely lack photoreceptors.</p>

                    CILIOPHORANS J.G. Van As, L. Basson. Department of Zoology/Entomology,
                    University of the Orange Free State, Bloemfontein, South Africa Trichodina
                    ultrastructure - Articulated internal skeleton The peritrichian genus Trichodina
                    is best knoyn as fish ectoparasites, but also comprises species associated with
                    a variety of aquatic invertebrate and vertebrate hosts. These conical,
                    cylinder-shaped ciliophorans possess an adhesive disc comprising a denticle ring
                    of interlinking denticles and other elements, such as a striated mem- brane
                    terminating in hinge-like structures on which the border membrane with its
                    radial pins articulates. All the elements within the adhesive disc are
                    interlinked via a net- work of myofibrils which find attachment in different
                    parts of the body, thus providing contractile properties to the ciliate. In
                    order to study the morphology of the denti- cles, we applied a technique
                    normally used for softening chitin. This technique dissol- ved the soft material
                    of the ciliate, leaving only the hard elements of the adhesivè disc. Scanning
                    electronmicroscopical studies on this material revealed a remarkable analogy
                    between the shape of the denticles and the vertebrae in the spinal column of
                    vertebrates.</p>
                <p>The structure of the denticles suggests that a restricted turning movement of
                    individual denticles may be possible. Distorsion of the denticle ring is
                    prevented by the ray and blade so that the adhesive disc will maintain its basic
                    shape, whilst allowing enough flexibility to attach to an uneven surface. The
                    denticle ring does not only serve as support for the body, but facilitates
                    attachment of myofibrils which makes body movement possible when these ciliates
                    excecute different movements, i.e. swimming free or attach- ing to the surface
                    of its host. To our knowledge, the articulated denticle ring of trichodinids is
                    the only example of a support system in unicellular organisms, with the
                    resemblance and analogy to the spinal column of vertebrates.</p>

                    Dirofilaria repens.Adult females of both mosquitoes fed on dogs infected with
                    D.repens. The samples of Malpighian tubules,hemocoel and proboscid were
                    collected 3,6,8,10 and 16 days post- infection for each group,and fixed for
                    electron microscopy.Three days after the blood meal,microfilariae of both Aedes
                    and Anopheles were observed within Malpighian tubule primary cells as
                    intracellular parasites. During the later stages of infection (8,10 days),the
                    nematode larvae filled a considerable portion of primary cells. At this
                    stage,larvae were also visible free in the hemocoel,thus exposing themselves to
                    hemocytic response. Host hemocytes were observed adhering to the nematode's
                    cuticle and there was often a layer of dark pigment (probably melanin) between
                    hemocyte and parasite. Remnants of hemocytes were occasionally seen dispersed
                    within the hemocoel.</p>
                <p>At 16 days post-infection,infective larvae (L_) had migrated to the proboscid in
                    both Aedes and Anopheles. These observations are consistent with the hypothesis
                    that the host defense in both mosquitoes fails to destroy this parasite.</p>

                <p>L'identification spécifique des cercaires de Schistosomes est rendue possible par
                    l'étude des sensilles (chétotaxie) après imprégnation argentique. Les
                    observations concernent 84 lots ou isolats représentés par quatre espèces:
                    Schistosoma bovis, S. haematobium, S. curassoni et S.</p>
                <p>intercalatum, originaires d'Afrique et de Madagascar. Ces espèces sont
                    identifiées soit par l'analyse enzymatique des Vers adultes, soit par la forme
                    des oeufs, ou par la localisation des parasites. Les cercaires sont émises par
                    des Mollusques infestés naturellement ou expérimentalement. L'analyse
                    factorielle discriminante est basée sur 9 variables: moyennes arithmétiques de 3
                    indices cercariens: ADX, ALx et Ux. Coefficients d'aplatissement: ADA, ALA, Ua,
                    et de dissymétrie: ADS, ALSs, Us, des courbes de distribution de ces indices.
                    Les indices AD et AL correspondent respectivement à la distance relative de
                    certaines papilles dorsales ou latérales, U correspond au nombre total des
                    papilles du tronc caudal. Dans 92,8 % des cas, les cercaires sont affectées à
                    leur espèce d'appartenance. Les mauvaises affectations proviennent presque
                    toujours d'infestations expérimentales de Mollusques allopatriques. Ce
                    pourcentage atteint 97,1 % pour l'Afrique de l'Ouest, d'où S. intercalatum est
                    absent. Il est de 100 % pour les infestations naturelles. Cette méthode est donc
                    très intéressante pour l'épidémiologiste.</p>

                    tetraphyllidean family Onchobothriidae and representing the following 8 genera:
                    Pedibothrium, Potsrnpirysonncesius, Spiniloculus, Platybothrium, Onchobothrium,
                    d Calliobothrium, were examined with scanning electron microscopy to investigate
                    the utility of pre microthrix patterns as systematic characters. In a 2
                    non-onchobothriid tetraphyllideans, Ceratobothrium xanthocephalum an and
                    Orygmatobothrium sp., lecanicephalideans, Disculiceps galapagoensis, and
                    Disculiceps pileatus, and one trypanorhynch, Horiceps minaçanthus, were examined
                    for comparison. In each species scolex microtriches were found to be
                    intraspecifically invariable and interspecifically very variable both in terms
                    of form and pattern of distribution. Microtriches observed among the
                    onchobothriids included a small filamentous form, a small spherical form, a
                    blade-like form tapering gradually to a sharp distal point, a blade-like form
                    tapering gradually to a blunt distal point, and a blade-like form tapering
                    gradually for most of its length then acutely to a filamentous distal point. No
                    microtriches resembling the palmate form of trypanorhynchs or the "com-cob" form
                    of Orygmatobothrium were observed in the onchobothriids. All regions of the
                    scolex were covered with at least one form of microthrix in all species, with
                    the exception of the apical pad of the lecanicephalideans; most regions of the
                    scolex were covered with at least 2 different forms of microtriches.</p>
                <p>It is clear that microtriches are of significant systematic value. For example,
                    the unique lack of blade-like microtriches on the distal surfaces of the
                    bothridia in species with three post-hook loculi supports the monophyly of the
                    group including the genera: _Acanthobothrium, Acanthobothroides, Onchobothrium,
                    Calliobothrinm and Platybothrium.</p>

                    musculature longitudinale interne chez quelques Cestodes Proteocephalidea. La
                    systématique est fondée sur la disposition des organes internes : les
                    Proteocephalidae possèdent des vitellogènes médullaires et les Monticellidae des
                    vitellogènes corticaux.</p>
                <p>Nous avons constaté, pour 4 espèces de Proteocephalidea, des vitellogènes acollés
                    à la musculature longitudinale interne et débordant à la fois dans le cortex et
                    dans la mé- dulla. Nous avons nommé cette disposition paramusculaire. Il1 s'agit
                    de Gibsoniela mandube (Woodland, 1935), parasite de Ageneiosus brevifilis

                    (Monticelli- dae). L'une de ces espèces (P. paraguayensis) présente une
                    formation de l'utérus mature tout à fait originale. Ce type de développement
                    correspond-il à une situation intermé- diaire entre les Proteocephalidae et les
                    Monticellidae ? En l'état actuel de la systématique des Proteocephalidea, nous
                    serions tentés de créer une nouvelle sous-famille pour ce groupe de parasites.
                    Pourtant, nous pensons qu'il est actuellement prématuré d'apporter un changement
                    à la systématique de cet ordre. En effet, pour un grand nombre de descriptions

                <p>Polymorphism, Eimerian oocysts, subterranean Mammals Sporulated oocysts from wild
                    hosts may present unique problems of identification that are separable into at
                    least 4 problem areas (Parker and Duszynski, 1986). One area, high polymorphism
                    of oocysts presumed to represent one species within the same or closely related
                    host species, was well documented in Eimeria reichenowi from sandhill cranes
                    (ibid.). Here we document a similar situation from subterranean rodents,
                    Ctenomvys spp. (tuco-tucos), from Bolivia, South America. Three hundred
                    sixty-four tuco-tucos representing 8 species collected from 4 distinct ecotones
                    were examined for coccidian oocysts. Five host species, C. boliviensis, C.
                    conoveri, C. frater, C. lewisi, and C. opimus had oocysts of E. opimi, described
                    originally from C. opimus. Oocysts of E. opimi were similar qualitatively (polar
                    bodies, residuua, etc.), but showed extreme polymorphism in oocyst and sporocyst
                    length and width, both from a single host species and between host species.
                    Analysis of variance showed no differences in mean measurements between oocysts
                    from C. opimus and C, lewisi, but showed statistical differences in some mean
                    measurements between oocysts from C. frater and C. conoveri compared to those
                    from €. opimus. However, neither a Principal Components Analysis nor a
                    Discriminant Analysis of the 4 variables examined allowed us to clearly
                    discriminate among the groups of oocysts measured from each host species. Thus,
                    it appears that E.</p>
                <p>opimi represents an old species that may be considered plesiomorphic (having

                    systematics The caudal papillae and papillae-like structures of species of the
                    Ascaridoidea, are divided into five distinct groups noted as: distal papillae
                    (basic number: four pairs, some of which may occur even anterior to the cloaca),
                    paracloacal papillae (two pairs), proximal papillae (some of which may be found
                    even posterior to the cloaca), median papilla (or plaque), and phasmids. The
                    distribution patterns and numbers of caudal papillae suggest the presence of
                    several developmental lines in the Ascaridoidea. The results are related to
                    previous information mainly regarding the morphology of the excretory system and
                    oesophagus . The results suggest a classification which largely mirrors that
                    which has been deduced previously by analysing other morphological structures.
                    Detailed information concerning caudal morphology and intraspecific variability
                    is needed in species of numerous genera.</p>
                <p>It is suggested that male caudal morphology could be an important supplementary

                <p>Coevolutionary phylesis was studied in six species of rodents of the genus
                    Ctenomys and nematodes of the genus Paraspidodera. Representatives of the rodent
                    family Octodontidae were used as outgroups for the ctenomyids while nematodes of
                    the genus Paraspidodera from caviids were analyzed as outgroups for the
                    nematodes. For the nematodes, quantitative and qualitative morphological
                    characteristics of both males and females and electrophoretic characters of both
                    sexes were used to generate phylogenetic hypotheses of evolutionary
                    relationships of the OTUs occurring in hosts of different species. Concordance
                    estimates of cladograms generated from biothemical- genetic and morphologic data
                    of the nematodes show a percentage incongruence (Mickevich-Farris Incongruence
                    Statistic or Imr) of 8.23 % in the character- sets. Parsimony mapping of both
                    morphologic and biochemical-genetic data indicates an overall agreement of
                    82.3%. Comparisons of topologies of the host and parasite cladograms as measured
                    with parsimony mapping showed 68% concordance, indicating substantially more
                    cospeciation than host-switching in the Ctenomys-Paraspidodera system. Nematodes
                    of the genus Paraspidodera appear to have switched from cavioid rodents to the
                    precursors of the ctenomyid lineage in late Pliocene time.</p>

                    LESTER PERKINSUS, APICOMPLEXA Protozoans of the genus Perkinsus, a parasite
                    which causes devastating losses of molluscs of commercial importance, were found
                    to be widespread in bivalves on the Great Barrier Reef. Host specificity was not
                    evident in cross infection experiments using Perkinsus sp. isolated from 5
                    species of Australian mollusc. Infections of Perkinsus sp. în À. trapezia, T.
                    gigas and H. Taevigata were pathogenic: there was a significant difference in
                    number of infected and uninfected molluscs which died under temperature stress
                    în the laboratory. Tridacna crocea from Lizard Island, however, did not show a
                    difference in the length weight relationship between clams infected With
                    Perkinsus sp. and those which were uninfected. Three isolates of Perkinsus from
                    Australian molluscs; Andara trapezia, Tridacna gigas and Haliotis laevigata,
                    were investigated to determine species affinities. The time taken for
                    sporulation in sea- water, the diameter of the prezoosporangium compared to the
                    size of the discharge tube, the size of zoospore body and flagella and the size
                    and appearance of the parasite in histological section were used to separate the

                    for preparing mallophagan samples for S.E.M. studies, in order to observe the
                    sensitive structures of the parasite, paying special attention to buccal and
                    antennal organs Over 150 Bovicola cCaprée specimens were used. The material was
                    fixed into a filtered 107 formaldehide solution. Several physical and chemical
                    methods were tested for the samples cleaning. Previously the roughest particles
                    were carried away with a fine brush.using bidestilled water under pressure,
                    applied with a syringe AS physical cleaning method, samples were sonicated.
                    Several sonication times were tested. Some chemical cleaners were used: xylol,
                    157 KOH solution (at 50-60 -C), 57 acetic acid solution (at 50-60 :C}), 20:
                    ethylic solution (at 10-20 -C) and ethylic ether., The samples were exposed to
                    the cleaners action during 30 minutes, in three periods of 40 minutes. Samples
                    were mounted with double-sided adhesives. They were dehydrated by means of
                    lyophilization, at -40 -C and a pressure of 125 Hg mm. Several lyophilization
                    times were tested: vacuum, 5 minutes, 15 minutes, 30 minutes and 45 minutes.
                    Samples were coated with gold at vacuum in the presence of argon. We tested the
                    following coating times: 4 minute, 2 minutes and 3 minutes. The material was
                    observed within à S.E.M. Zeiss DSM 950 in the Technical Services of the Granada
                    University.</p>
                <p>The fixation with 107 formaldehide solution gave excellent results since it did
                    not produce visible arte- facts and provided an optimum work distance: 14-16 mm,
                    at an elevated kilovoltage: 25-30 Kv. Moreover, a postfixation was not
                    neccesary, The sonication is not advisable since several parasite structures
                    result damaged. With regards to the chemical cleaning methods, the use of xylol
                    produced artefacts and attacked the insect cuticle, The treatment with KOH did
                    not produce an homogeneous cleaning, as well as with acetic acid, The most
                    optimum results were obtaned using ethylic ether, since it maintain the body
                    turgescence and elimi- nate the greasy deposits adhered to the parasite cuticle,
                    which hide structures; dehydrating at vacuum and using à 2 minutes coating time,

                    Zasilia (Nycte- ribiidae) and Crataerina (Hippoboscidae) as sisters groups was
                    done, using 75 characters from head, thorax, abdomen, wings, and legs. 20 of
                    them were multistate then totalising 99 binary characters (two-state). Cladistic
                    rela- tionships were deduced using 3 computer programs: BIOSICLAM, PHYLLIP, and
                    NTSYS comprissing 42 clustering methods. Results show 3 Phylogenetic groups: a)
                    TRICHOBIINAE s.s., probably less evolved and more heterogeneous; b)NYCTE-
                    ROPHILIINAE a group highly modified and close related to Zasilia and perhaps a
                    member of Nycteribiidae rather than Streblidae, and c) STREBLINAE s.1. a group
                    evolved separately, where Ældunia and Stizostrebla must be included.</p>

                    rapport aux nouveaux repères topogra- phiques définis dans un travail précédent.
                    A partir de ces descriptions des hypothèses sont proposées concernant
                    l'évolution des principaux groupes de papilles, et plus particulièrement celle
                    des papilles céphaliques. L'analyse des ca- ractères et la construction des
                    arbres ont été réalisées en utilisant le logiciel MacClade 2.1 de Wayne &amp;
                    David MADISON.</p>
                <p>L'étude comprend trois parties: 1°, l'analyse phénétique, dans laquelle les états
                    reconnaissables selon le nombre et la position des papilles à la surface du
                    tégument ont été répertoriés comme autant de caractères en présence/absence; 2°,
                    l'interprétation de l'évolution de certains groupes de papilles et la
                    construction de morphoclines: pour chaque genre, puis successivement pour deux,
                    puis plusieurs genres, on a recherché la forme la plus simple (c'est à dire
                    l'ancêtre hypo- thétique), ayant pu évoluer vers chacune des espèces les
                    constituant; 3°, l'analyse cladistique des espèces et des essais de construction
                    d'une classification phylogénétique. En l'absence de données biologiques
                    permettant d'interpréter l'évolution des papilles nous avons admis les
                    hypothèses suivantes: (i) une ou plusieurs papilles repérées dans la même
                    situation topographique chez des espèces différentes, sont considérées comme
                    homologues, (ii) au cours de l'évolution la chétotaxie tend à se compliquer par
                    augmentation du nombre des papilles sur les cycles nerveux, (iii) les nouvelles
                    pa- pilles apparaissent le plus souvent au niveau des commissures entre les
                    cycles et les axes nerveux, (iv) une fois apparues les papilles peuvent se
                    multiplier sur le même site et (ou) se déplacer le long des axes nerveux; ces
                    mouvements étant liés au basculement de l'ouverture buccale qui est en position
                    apicale chez les espèces les plus primitives et tend à deve- nir de plus en plus
                    ventrale.</p>
                <p>La comparaison de la classification de départ et de la classification obtenue
                    montre que: (i) à l'exception des Maritrema, tous les taxons étudiés, du genre à
                    la super famille, peuvent être considérés comme monophylétiques; (il) la
                    subdivision des Maritrema en deux groupes paraphylétiques coincide avec des
                    particularités écologiques remarquables de leurs hôtes respectifs; (iii) le
                    genre Gynaecotyla apparaît comme synonyme du genre Microphallus; (iv) les
                    différentes classifications proposées diffèrent uniquement par la position des
                    Lecithodendriidae, le meilleur de ces arbres, d'un point de vue cladistique,
                    situant ce groupe comme le groupe frère de l'ensemble des autres taxons.</p>

                    Entodiniomorphida - Gorilla - SEM - Troglodytellidae Only two troglodytellid
                    species, Troglodytella gorillae and T. abrassarti have been reported from the
                    large intestine of gorilla. We surveyed the fresh feces of wild lowland gorilla
                    in Gabon, West Africa by light and scanning electron microscopy, and detected at
                    least three troglodytellid species. Every species was about 200 um in length,
                    and possessed smooth-surfaced cap at anterior part of body, accessory somatic
                    ciliary ribbons in addition to the adoral cilia, large skeleton and many
                    contractile vacuoles beneath the body surface, elongated and "L' shaped
                    macronucleus, and ovoid micronucleus. Although one of them was immediately
                    identified as T. gorillae from its body shape and shortened ciliary ribbons,
                    there were no former descrintions on the other two species. One resembled T.
                    abrassarti in body shape and possessing four ciliary ribbons, but it was clearly
                    distinguished in the length and situation of ciliary ribbons and the number of
                    contractile vacuoles. Another one possessed only three ciliary ribbons, then it
                    was considered that this species should be classified into a new genus of
                    Troglodytellidae. As most of entodiniomorphid species inhabit the intestine of
                    either Perissodactyla or Artiodactyla, Troglodytellidae is considered to be a
                    peculiarly differentiated group in Entodiniomorphida alike the ciliates of Poly-
                    diniellidae found from elephants. Troglodytellids are quite different from
                    polydinie- llids in the structure of adoral ciliary zones, but they resemble
                    each other in the points of general shape and possessing somatic ciliary
                    ribbons. Large and complicated bodies of the ciliates of apes and elephants may
                    indicate that these entodiniomorphid ciliates originated from African
                    ungulates.</p>

                    Bloch, 1782, type species of Hispaniolepis Lopez-Neyra,1942,is no longer
                    available and its original description is very succinct.An examination involving
                    the best redescriptions available and several specimens referred to in such
                    descrip- tions,as well as materials yet unpublished labelled
                    ‘'villosa'"',revealed that no less than five different species had been
                    described under this name.Thus, choosing a neotype for villosa became an
                    essential prerequisite in order to be able to revise this genus.</p>
                <p>At the Institute of Zoology of Pavia we found some material preserved in vials,
                    that had been collected in loco (and was identical to specimens from the Goeze
                    collection, 1786, stored at the same Institute), which seemed to fit Bloch's
                    species better than any other material and any previous description, also on
                    account of zoo-geographical considerations.This material is now proposed as the
                    neotype of villosa Bloch nec aucto- rum and will be described so as to provide a
                    well-defined term of reference.The most salient species-specific feature in the
                    genus Hispaniolepis (which are usually neglected) are seen to lie in the
                    atrium-genital structures and the vaginal sphincter (see poster),while
                    traditional characters become less significant. As an initial result villosa
                    sensu Lopez-Neyra,1941 becomes H.hispanica nom.nov. and villosa sensu Skrjabin,
                    1914 becomes H.turkestanica nom.nov.,while villosa sensu Dollfus,1957 will have
                    to be regarded ad a new species.</p>

                    ridges - Spiculopteragia - polymorphism The synlophe or the cuticular ridge
                    pattern of Spiculopteragia boehmi, S. asymmetrica, Rinadia mathevossiani and
                    Apteragia quadrispiculata is characteristic for Spiculopteragia. There seem to
                    be no continuous sub- ventral and subdorsal ridges. The ventral ridge is
                    interrupted by cuticular swellings before and behind the excretory pore.
                    Sometimes the ventral ridge is absent for a short distance distal of the
                    excretory pore. For some distance in front of the excretory pore two ridges are
                    parallel and adjacent to the ventral ridge, they bend laterally to the excretory
                    pore and extend for a short distance distally. There, in be- tween these ridges,
                    some six ridges in addition to the ventral ridge are seen. Mostly only four of
                    these reach the area of the excretory pore.</p>
                <p>The thin lateral ridges are seen ventral of the cervical papillae. Just in front
                    of the cervical papillae ends a ridge. Though there is a fair amount of
                    variability in the pattern the described features are pretty consistent. As
                    usually R. mathevossiani and A. quadrispiculata are found in small numbers
                    together with S. boehmi and S. asymmetrica respectively the identity of the
                    synlophes is additional support for the existence of polymorphism in S. boehmi
                    and S. asymmetrica.</p>

                    Davaineidae, morphology, taxonomy An assessment is made of the taxonomic value
                    of selected characters used to distinguish between members of the cestode family
                    Davaineidae Fuhrmann, 1907.</p>
                <p>Their reliability and significance at the subfamily, generic and subgeneric
                    levels are evaluated. The characters examined include features (i) of the scolex
                    (shape of the rostellar crown, number of hook rows, hook size and shape,
                    presence of rostellar spines, sucker shape and armature); (ii) of the mature
                    proglottids (genitalia paired or single, alternation of the genital pores,
                    configuration of the gonads, number of osmoregulatory canals); and (iii) of the
                    gravid proglottids (presence or absence of a persistent uterus, paruterine organ
                    or egg capsules, number of capsules per proglottid and of eggs per capsule).
                    Conclusions are drawn on the validity of a number of davaineid genera.</p>

                <p>Cercaria echinata - nervous system The nervous system of C.echinata has been
                    studied with different methods as follows: The internal nervous elements such as
                    ganglia, neurons, longitudinal nerve stems, and trans- verse commissures, were
                    studied in cercariae fixed by the histochemical method for glio- xylic acid and
                    examined with green light fluorescence. Integumentary nervous elements such as
                    setae, small and large papillae were studied in cercariae impregnated with 2%
                    silver nitrate solution, and were studied using a light microscope. Cercariae
                    were also studied with transmission electron microscope. The external (surface)
                    elements such as sensory hills, craters, holes, papillae and cillia were studied
                    using SEM. The results showed: 1. The internal nervous elements are similar to
                    those described in different echi nostomid, diplostomid and philophthalmid
                    cercariae. 2. The integumentary papillae are spe cies-specific and differ in the
                    number and arrangement in all closely related species. 3.</p>
                <p>The external (surface) nervous elements are concentrated over special nervous
                    hills named in respects to their localization as nasal, frontal, maxilar,
                    occipital, auricular and coronarn. Each hill possesses à very specific number of
                    craters, holes and papillae arran ged in a very typical way. Nasal, frontal and
                    maxilar hills joint in a common face. In its face C.echinata resembles a lion
                    and differs from that of genus Echinostoma, Isthmio- phora, Echinoparyphium,
                    Neoacanthoparyphium, Hypoderaeum and Moliniella. 4. The internal nervous
                    elements are connected with the outside ones with fibres and share a common pat-
                    tern of localization. 5.The integumentary papillae visible in silver
                    impregnation inclu- ding these of AID and acetabulum differ significantly in
                    number and positions from those studied using SEM.6.The nervous elements of
                    C.echinata are thought to be motor and sen- sory in function.Structures adapted
                    for reception of touch,light and chemical attractions are recognized.</p>

                <p>Schistosoma haematobium, Schistosoma mattheei, hybridization The bovine
                    schistosome, Schistosoma mattheei, has the ability to infect humans and to
                    hybridize with the human parasite, Schistosoma haematobium. It has been
                    suggested that hybridization may influence the epidemiology and phylogeny of the
                    two species in southern Africa.</p>
                <p>However, little experimental evidence exists to substantiate these suggestions.
                    In the current study a multifaceted approach was employed to study the
                    interaction between the two species.</p>
                <p>Electrophoretic characterization of enzymes and scanning electron microscopy of
                    adults and larvae of the two species indicated that they are more closely
                    related in the eastern part of the subcontinent than in the western areas of
                    their distribution. It was shown that in the areas of sympatry all S. mattheei
                    eggs from human vésical complex infections contain viable F1 hybrid miracidia
                    which are the result of mating between S. haematobium males and S. mattheei
                    females. À mathematical model based on epidemiological data and on
                    experimentally obtained results indicated that in nature the probability of
                    backcrossing of F1 hybrids with S. haematobium is greater than backcrossing with
                    S. mattheei. However, observed spatial patterns in distribution of human S.
                    mattheei infections in southern Africa is not the result of introgressive
                    hybridization but seems instead to be dependent on specific
                    topographically-related water temperature regimes and certain agricultural
                    practices.</p>

                <p>Taenia, systematics, isoenzyme, DNA Representatives of the family Taeniidae
                    infect a large range of mammalian hosts and are responsible for significant
                    economic loss. A number of species also cause human disease; most notably,
                    Taenia solium as a cause of cysticercosis and Echinococcus as a cause of hydatid
                    disease. Evolutionary relationships between species in the family taeniidae have
                    been little studied. Previous taxonomic investigations have concentrated on
                    morphologi- cal characteristics. However, several species of Taenia have
                    recently been characterised using biochemical and molecular techniques. These
                    techniques have also been utilised in taxonomic studies on numerous other
                    parasites.</p>
                <p>This project examines evolutionary relationships between five species of
                    Taeniidae known to occur in Australia and New Zealand: T. serialis, T.
                    hydatigena, T. ovis, T. taeniae- formis and E. granulosus. Data matrices were
                    created using a number of techniques: bio- logical characters, morphological
                    characters, isoenzyme patterns obtained from starch gel electrophoresis and DNA
                    hybridization patterns obtained using a mitochondrial and a ribosomal probe.</p>
                <p>Using phenetic and phylogenetic analysis of these data, it has been possible to
                    suggest evolutionary relationships between species. Hypothetical relationships
                    developed from each of these data matrices and type of analysis are compared and
                    discussed. These are also considered in light of current theories on the
                    evolution within the family Taeniidae.</p>

                <p>Cestodes - Metadilepididae - Systematics The order Cyclophyllidea, the best known
                    among cœstodes, is composed of about fifteen fa- milies among which appear the
                    Dilepididae Fuhrmann, 1907 and the Paruterinidae Fuhrmann, 1907. Both are widely
                    accepted, as sam characteristics, usually considered fundamental, are clearly
                    different in each of them: *Rostellum with a pouch and sacciform uterus in
                    Dilepididae.</p>
                <p>*Rostellum without a pouch and presence of a paruterine organ in
                    Paruterinidae.</p>
                <p>In 1947, the genus Metadilepis was created by Spassky for Dilepis qlobacantha
                    Fuhrmann, 1913. This species is particular in harbouring neither a paruterine
                    organ nor a rostellar pouch, but was nevertheless classified among Dilepididae
                    by all systematicians. Metadile- pidinae, then Metadilepididae (Spassky, 1959),
                    grouping together at first three, and then eight genera with intermediate
                    characteristics between the Dilepididae and the Paruteri- nidae, were created
                    later. This family, despite the lack of a paruterine organ, is consi- dered
                    closer to the Paruterinidae than the Dilepididae.</p>
                <p>The family Mtadilepididae has surprisingly never been considered by Western
                    authors.</p>
                <p>This is rather astonishing when considering that Metadilepididae form a group,
                    admittedly small, but homogeneous and having a very interesting position in
                    cyclophyllidean syste— matics. We have found several species of Mtadilepididae,
                    one of which belongs to a new genus. This material, together with the work of
                    Russian authors entitles us to: A) Confirm the validity of Mtadilepididae.</p>
                <p>B) Discuss the relative importance of criteria used in cyclophyllidean

                    wolves,foxes,jackals slow growth and development of all four species of Taeniat
                    are observed.Growth and development of Taeniat go on quicker in young dogs.Slow
                    growth of Taeniat is observed also at high invasion ïin- tensity.Growth and
                    development of larvae form T.pisiformis don't depend on intermediate
                    hosts',i.e.,rabbits' breed belonging. White linear mice appeared to be more

                    than non-linear ones.</p>
                <p>It has been established that optimum doses for rabbit infection with T.pisiformis

                    and Far-Eastern popu- lations of the following s.l. Taenia species, parasitizing
                    Carnivora in adult stages, as well as their metacestodes from Artiodactyla,
                    Lagomorpha and Rodentia: Taenia crassiceps, T.hydatigena, T.martis, T.multiceps,
                    T.ovis, T.pisiformis, T.polyacantha, T.taeniaeformis. From four species:
                    T.kotlani, T.parva, T.parenchymatosa and T.serialis only metacestodes were
                    available.</p>
                <p>In many cases the description of Taenia species gives only the number and the
                    length of the two types of the rostellar hooks. On this ground several authors
                    consider species (e. g. T.hydatigena, T.ursina and T.jakhalsi) with hooks of
                    similar length to be synonymous.</p>
                <p>The scolex morphology of the above-mentioned 12 taeniid species (adults and fully
                    developed larvae) has been studied in order to find constant measurable features
                    for comparative purposes. For the biometrical ana- lysis we measured the scolex
                    and its organelles, the number of the rost- ellar hooks, the length of the large
                    and small hooks, the length of the handle and the width of the qguard. Two
                    ratios of the former measurements: handle index and guard index were found to be
                    useful in specific differ- entiation.</p>
                <p>Conclusion: The quantitative parameters of the rostellar hooks of the
                    metacestodes and of the adult specimens, belonging to the same Taenia species,
                    are identical.</p>

                    tree and the trees produced in the present study were compared. The results
                    suggest that the existance of the family Sicuophoridae is artificial and clearly
                    untenable, therefore, the above family is suppressed and the diagnosis of the
                    family Nyctotheridae is amplified accordingly. It has also been noted that
                    Sicuophora magna does not cluster with other species of the genus 51 cuophora,
                    hence a new generic status is being propose or e reception of this species, 225

                    Afin de permettre une étude spécifique comparative, il est donc essentiel de
                    tenir compte de ces facteurs, qui sont au nombre de trois. 1. Hôte vertébré.
                    Exemple: S. bovis. Des Vers appariés obtenus de Rongeurs (Mus musculus,
                    Mesocricetus auratus, Mastomys erythroleucus) de J 65 à J 95 ont des tubercules
                    inermes. Des Vers appariés provenant d'un mouton (Ovis aries) à J 89 présentent
                    des plages épineuses. 2. Ancienneté de l'infection. Exemple: S. bovis. Des Vers
                    accouplés provenant d'un mouton à J 50 montrent des tubercules inermes. Des Vers
                    appariés obtenus de moutons à J 89 et J 240 portent des plages épineuses. 3.

                <p>The genus Parapharyngodon have genital papillae consisting of anterior group
                    around anus and posterior pair on caudal appendage. This arrangement has been
                    observed in all species and specimens studied from reptiles in Spain: P.
                    echinatus (Rudolphi, 1819), P. micipsae (Seurat, 1917), P. bulbosus (Linstow,
                    1899), P. psammodromi Roca et Lluch, 1986. Recently, we have found nematodes of
                    genus Parapharyngodon from lizards, Podarcis pityusensis (Sauria: Lacertidae) of
                    the Pitiusic Islands (Balearic Islands, Spain). One of the males showed an
                    anatomical peculiarity: absence of papillae on caudal appendage. This specimen
                    is similar to the males of P. micipsae (development of lateral alae; presence of
                    spicule; number and arrangement of cloacal papillae) excepted character
                    mentioned above.</p>
                <p>The absence of the last pair of genital papillae must be considered as a case of
                    anatomical aberration induced by some mutation. It is no possible consider this
                    absence as a taxonomical character because it haven't been observed in a
                    population (and with a significant frecuency), but only in one specimen.</p>

                <p>Adult Schistosoma nasale, scanning electron-microscopy Scanning electron
                    micrographs of adult male and female Schistosoma nasale are illustrated. The
                    tubercles on the dorsal and dorso-lateral surfaces of unpaired male S. nasale
                    are devoid of spines. In paired male worms the tubercles on the dorsal surface
                    are large and also devoid of spines, but some tubercles on the dorso-lateral
                    surface possess spines. Pit-like openings are visible on the surface of the
                    smooth tubercles. The oral and ventral suckers on the male worm are well
                    developed and are invested with spines, as are the gynaecophoric canal and flap.
                    Ciliated sensory receptors are distributed over the surface of the male worm.
                    The oral and ventral suckers of the female worm are much smaller- than those of
                    the male: spines occur on both suckers. The surface of the female is
                    non-tuberculate and is thrown into transverse folds. Pit-like openings are
                    visible at higher magnifications. The anterior end of the female is heavily
                    invested in ciliated receptors, whereas the posterior is heavily spined. The
                    surface topography of S. nasale is briefly discussed in relation to other
                    species of Schistosoma.</p>

                    Majadahonda, Spain Leishmania, HIV, characterization Leishmaniasis associated to
                    immunocompromissing diseases are of increased interest since AIDS magnifies this
                    problem. L. infantum can be found both in skin and in visceral lesi- ons:
                    probably, cutaneous stocks can be correlated with the zymodemes 11 and 29
                    (MON-11, MON-29) and visceral stocks with MON-1 and MON-28. So far, in Spain the
                    descri- bed zymodemes are MON-1, 28 and 29. In order to verify if the parasite
                    involved in this association is biologically identical to the isolates involved
                    in "normal" leishmania- sis, 7 stocks of Leishmania from HIV positive persons
                    were isolated both from seroposi- tive and seronegative leishmaniasis as well
                    from cutaneous and visceral lesions.</p>
                <p>For the parasite typing 3 methods were carried out: isoenzyme analysis using a 7
                    enzyme system panel (GPI, G6PD, 6PGD, GOT, NP, MD and PGM) in conjunction with
                    starch gel elec- trophoresis; kDNA digested with Hae-III agarose
                    electrophoresis, Southern-blot and hy- bridization with the L. infantum 307/K-1
                    kDNA probe; and, finally, karyotyping by pulsed field gradient electrophoresis
                    (PFG) in 0.1% agarose gel.</p>
                <p>By isoenzyme analysis, zymodeme was isolated from both visceral and cutaneous
                    stocks and zymodeme 29 from a single cutaneous isolate: this patient developed
                    visceral leishmania- sis later on. A ladder of bands by schyzodeme analysis,
                    using Hae-III, was obtained. The same complicated pattern appeared by
                    hybridization with the KDNA probe and PFG. Similar patterns were observed in dog
                    and fox isolates and in non immunocompromissed human Leish- mania stocks.
                    Therefore it can be concluded that Leishmania isolates from persons with HIV
                    infection are identical than those involved in the usual cycle: immunosupression
                    simply amplifies the epidemiological problem of leishmaniasis.</p>

                    small subunit ribosomal RNA (srRNA) was performed on bulk cellular RNA from six
                    species of the genus Eimeria which infect poultry (E. acervulina, E. brunetti,
                    E. maxima, E. mitis, E. tenella and E. adenoeides). Approximately 750 sites were
                    sequenced from each species using three oligonucleotide primers complementary to
                    highly conserved regions on the srRNA molecule. Sequencing was accomplished
                    using AMV reverse transcriptase and standard dideoxy-nucleotide chain
                    termination techniques (Sanger sequencing). The resulting sequences were aligned
                    by eye with the complete or partial sequences of four other apicomplexan taxa
                    (Sarcocystis gigantea, Cryptosporidium sp., Plasmodium berghei and Toxoplasma
                    gondii).</p>
                <p>Phylogenetically informative sites (133 sites) were analyzed with a
                    microcomputer-based maximum-parsimony algorithm. The six Eimeria species form a
                    monophyletic group which is the sister group to the other coccidia (T. gondii
                    and S. gigantea). The morphologically distinct E. maxima was found to the sister
                    taxon to the remaining Eimeria species which have small oocysts. Three
                    monophyletic groups were observed among these latter species: 1) E. acervulina;
                    2) E. mitis and E. brunetti; 3) E.</p>
                <p>tenella and E. adenoeides. The relationships among these monophyletic groups were
                    not resolved. Interestingly, the species with the same localization in the avian
                    gut (E.</p>
                <p>tenella and E. adenoeides which infect the caeca of chickens and turkeys
                    respectively; E. brunetti and E. mitis which infect the middle portion of the
                    alimentary tract) clustered together whereas all of the species from one host
                    did not. This suggests that the niche specialization along the avian gut may
                    have occurred prior to the split of the chicken and turkey ancestors;
                    alternately, either E. adenoeides or E. tenella may have arisen as a result of
                    host switching and subsequent speciation.</p>

                <p>Giardia duodenalis, cloning, isoenzyme electrophoresis Giardia duodenalis is the
                    most commonliy reported intestinal protozoan pathogen in Australia. Isolates of
                    G. duodenalis, derived from faecal samples of infected hosts and maintained in
                    axenic culture, have been shown to differ in virulence, infectivity, anti-
                    genicity and susceptibility to drugs. Genetic comparisons, using isoenzyme
                    electrophor- esis and DNA hybridization, have also shown differences between
                    isolates, but the results are complicated by the possibility of genetic
                    heterogeneity within an isolate.</p>
                <p>This problem can be overcome by using cloned populations, and a number of cloning
                    tech- niques have been reported. Using a novel method for cloning Giardia
                    duodenalis from cultures and faecal samples, forty four clones from six
                    different isolates were estab- lished in vitro. Average colony forming
                    efficiency in established cultures was 36.9% com- pared to 3.3% when cloning
                    directly from excystation. The highest success rate of cloning was found with
                    the Portland (Pl, ATCC No. 30888) isolate with a colony forming efficiency of
                    87.5%. Cloned and parent populations were compared over a range of thirteen
                    enzymes using starch gel electrophoresis. No genetic differences were found
                    between any of the clones and the parent isolates, indicating that the isolates
                    examined in this study represent homogeneous populations of Giardia.</p>

                    polymerase chain reaction (PCR) permits rapid amplification and sequencing of
                    specific portions of the genome of any organism. Using this technique, we have
                    sequenced parts of several genes from a number of parasite species. Included are
                    two mitochondrial genes and one variable domain of the large subunit nuclear
                    rRNA gene.</p>
                <p>Variation within and between species has been sought. In the portion of the
                    nuclear rRNA gene sequenced, there is considerable variation even within such
                    apparently natural groups as the Digenea and the taeniid cestodes.</p>
                <p>When the most appropriate gene sequences have been identified for a given group
                    of parasites and adequate levels of resolution obtained, data can be acquired
                    rapidly using the PCR. Such information will provide the basis of a molecular
                    approach to parasite taxonomy, strain identification and improved DNA diagnosis

                <p>Cryopreservation - Echinococcus multilocularis.</p>
                <p>The maintenance of larval Echinococcus multilocularis is time consuming and
                    requires many laboratory animals. Moreover, repeated animals passages could
                    change the characteristics of some isolates. On the other hand, an understanding
                    of epidemiological differences within E.multilocularis spe- cies requires that
                    as many isolates as possible be gathered for isoenzyma- tic or DNA analyses.
                    Until now,in our laboratory, more than 22 isolates have been collected and their
                    number is increasing due to the regular receipt of surgical specimens from
                    infected humans. In order to overcome the constraints inherent in the
                    maintenance of this parasite, cryopreser- vation was developped.</p>
                <p>Cysts of E.multilocularis were minced to prepare à crude homogenate and after
                    addition of glycerol at a final concentration of 10%, cryopreserva- tion was
                    performed at rate of 1°C/min in a controlled rate freezer.The ali quots were
                    subsequently stored in liquid nitrogen. All 22 isolates tested were successfully
                    cryopreserved and their viability maintained more than one year after their
                    storage and a bank of parasites has been created.</p>

                <p>Trichinella species - freezing - cross-breeding The precise identification of
                    Trichinella species is of great importance for control of Trichinellosis. Any
                    scigmtific examination is quite impossible without knowledge of the species
                    status of the object. We propose two methods for identification of the capsul8-
                    forming Trichinella larvae: 1. By freezing of incapsulated larvae in the muscles
                    of the host at 18°C below zero. Under such conditions all larvae except those of
                    Trichinella nativa die within 3-4 days. The larvae of T.nativa keep their
                    infection capacity for one and a half years; 2. By means of cross-breeding: The
                    isolates which die under freezing were investigated in this way. For this
                    purpose it is necessary to have the standard species of T.nelsoni and
                    T.spiralis. The fertile generation between the isolate and the standard species
                    is a proof for the species status of the isolate to the standard used.</p>
                <p>We recommend only one couple of the "male" and "female" Trichinella larvae (@
                    belonging to the standard and o belonging the isolate and vice versa) to be used
                    in the cross- breeding examination. The results are recorded according to
                    availability of larvae 45 days following infection of mice. When more than one
                    couple of trichinella larvae is used it is better to investigate the mature
                    helminths (on 8-th or 10-th day after infection of the experimental mice).</p>

                    in the genus Giardia have been erected based on host specificity, cell
                    dimensions, and median body morphology. Despite these schemes, the species
                    taxonomy of Giardia is still in question. To investigate Giardia taxonomy on a
                    molecular level, Giardia chromosomal DNA was analyzed by
                    orthogonal-field-alternation gel electrophoresis (OFAGE) and transverse
                    alternating field electrophoresis (TAFE).</p>
                <p>Chromosomal DNA of Giardia isolated from human, muskrat, sheep, dog, beaver,
                    mouse, and great blue heron hosts were subjected to OFAGE and TAFE analyses.
                    Comparable DNA patterns were obtained by both methods, but OFAGE required 8 days
                    while TAFE required only 3 days. DNA patterns from human, muskrat, sheep, dog,
                    and beaver Giardia, while quite similar to each other, were distinctly different
                    from those of mouse and heron Giardia; mouse and heron Giardia DNA patterns were
                    distinctly different from each other. A human Giardia total DNA probe hybridized
                    to all human, muskrat, sheep, dog, and beaver Giardia DNA on Southern blots, but
                    not detectably to mouse and heron Giardia DNA. Similarly, mouse and heron
                    Giardia total DNA probes only hybridized detectably to their respective DNAs.
                    One probe has been developed which appears to hybridize to human, muskrat,
                    sheep, dog, beaver, and heron Giardia DNA rather than mouse Giardia DNA. Another
                    probe has been developed which only hybridizes detectably to mouse Giardia DNA.
                    These data suggest that the differentiation of Giardia isolated from host and
                    environmental samples may eventually be accomplished by DNA probes.</p>

                <p>Multilocus genetic analysis based on protein electrophoresis was carried out on
                    dog Dirofilaria repens and D.immitis from Italy. Seventeen enzymatic loci
                    provided reliable electrophoretic patterns which were compared in the two
                    species, All but one were monomorphic, Fixed alternative allozymes were found at
                    13 loci while only 3 loci shared apparently the same allozyme in the two
                    species, The polymorphic locus, Pqgm, also showed alternative allozymes. This
                    remarkably high genetic divergence, which presumably reflects a Very old
                    speciation process, allows an easy characterization of D.repens and
                    respectively. The electrophoretic patterns of nine of the enzymatic loci that
                    were found diagnostic between the two species, were utilized to identify an
                    immature Dirofilaria female, removed from a 32 ÿear-old woman resident in Sessa
                    Aurunca (Caserta province, Italy). The worm, tentatively assigned on a
                    morphological basis to D.conjunctivae- genetic evidence is in substantial
                    agreement with the hypothesis, already supported by morphological and
                    epidemiological data, that D.conjunctivae (Addario, 1885) Desportes, 1939-40 and
                    D,repens Railliet et Henry, 1911 are synonyms and that most human cases in the
                    Mediterranean area are due to this dog filaria. In compliance with the law of
                    priority, D.conjunctivae should be the name valid for the species, However, it
                    is here suggested to preserve the name repens, well established for the dog

                <p>L'analyse isoenzymatique après isoélectrofocalisation en gel de polyacrylamide
                    est employée pour une caractérisation biochimique des souches de T. gondii. Une
                    étude préalable, portant sur 8 souches, a permis de sélectionner 15 enzymes
                    donnant des bandes suffisamment intenses et constantes. Parmi ces 15 enzymes,
                    quatre révèlent des différences entre les souches : aspartate aminotransférase
                    (ASAT, EC 2.6.1.1.), amylase (AMY, EC 4.1.2.13), glucose phosphate isomérase
                    (GPI, EC 5.3.1.9), glutathion réductase (GSR, EC 1.6.4.2). La combinaison des
                    zymogrammes de ces 4 enzymes permet de décrire 3 zymodèmes au sein des 8 souches
                    : Z1 regroupant des souches aigües chez la souris (type RH), Z2 comportant des
                    souches initialement kystogènes chez la souris et Z3 constitué d'une seule
                    souche, de pathogénicité intermédiaire pour la souris. Parmi les 7 nouvelles
                    souches étudiées, 6 appartiennent au zymodème 2 et sont kysto- gènes chez la
                    souris, 1 au zymodème 1 (souche -4, mutant thermo- sensible de RH). Ces
                    résultats confirment la valeur de la caractérisation isoenzymatique des souches
                    de T. gondii.</p>

                <p>It is very well known fact the similitude which exist concerning the evolutive
                    forms living in the vector insect's intestine and also in the acellular culture
                    mediums. There is also evident the distinct infective capacity of the metacyclic
                    forms belonging to different environments and the important biochemical
                    differences between them. We have realized a comparative study of T. cruzi forms
                    (Bolivia strain) of the N.N.N. medium and the R. prolixus' intestine, through
                    the morphometric analysis with the IBAS-1 computer (Image Basic Analytic
                    System).</p>
                <p>By this way, we have established the existence of a great number of significant
                    differences between the evolutive forms from distinct mediums (cultures or
                    insect's intestine). The most important of these differences were observed
                    between the metacyclic forms from the N.N.N.</p>
                <p>culture and those from the vector's intestine, presenting the last ones greater
                    nucleus and kKinetoplast. The culture forms presented a more anterior position

                    isolates have been possible using electrophoretic techniques, among which we
                    have chosen isoelectric focusing (IEF) for its optimal resolution.</p>
                <p>The isoenzyme patterns of five Trichinella isolates: T.spiralis LASO LH-59,
                    T.nativa Boev, T.nelsoni C-76, T.pseudospiralis Garkavi and Trichinella sp.
                    isolated by us from a boar from Güejar-Sierra (Granada,Spain) were compared by
                    this technique.</p>
                <p>Isoelectrofocusing was performed in polyacrilamide gels(5#%T,3%C). The enzyme
                    systems tested were: SDH(EC 1.1.1.14),G6PD(EC 1.1.1.49), GPD(EC 1.1.1.8),
                    MDH(EC.1.1.</p>
                <p>1.37), ME(EC 1.1.1.40), SOD(EC 1.15.1.1), ES(EC 3.1.1.1) and LDH(EC
                    1.1.1.27).</p>
                <p>The pH range used for the separation was 3-10 except in the case of MDH(pH=5-10)
                    and ME(pH range-4-8).</p>
                <p>The isolates showed polymorfism in all the enzyme systems studied and the
                    observation of enzyme profiles evidence distintive differences between
                    them.Moreover, this is the first report on the presence of SDH in the
                    homogenates of Trichinella.</p>
                <p>The isoenzyme patterns clearly separate the five isolates in 3 groups:one
                    including T.pseudospiralis Garkavi,the second including T.nelsoni C-76 and the
                    third including T.spiralis LASO LH-59,T.nativa Boev and Trichinella sp. isolated

                    the identification of Greek leishmania strains from human visceral and cutaneous
                    cases using cellulose acetate electrophoresis and starch gel electrophoresis.
                    Among a total of 19 strains (17 from cutaneous lesions, 2 from visceral cases)
                    15 were found to be Leishmania tropica (L. tropica), three L. infantum and one
                    L. major. The strain identified as L. major is not of indigenous origin, but
                    “imported" from an endemic region. L. tropica and L. ïinfartum have been already
                    identified as the aethiological agents responsible for cutaneous and visceral
                    disease in Greece, respectively. However, the identification of dermotropic L.
                    infantum is reported for the first time in Greece, already known in several
                    Mediterranean countries (Italy, France, Spain, Algeria, Tunisia).</p>

                    directions in the development of marine parasitology are discussed. The
                    necessity of transition from faunistic researches of parasites to their study as
                    components of marine ecosystems, wide introduction of experimental methods into

                    parasitology with hydrobiology, the use of new methods of investigations were
                    emphasized. Practical aspects of marine parasitological investigations, in

                    a general survey on leishmaniases in the island of Gozo (Malta) in the summer
                    1989, 76 Rattus rattus and 28 R. norvegicus were examined. The rats were
                    live-trapped, and killed by ether. Liver/spleen aspirates were taken aseptically
                    and inoculated into blood-agar medium containing 20% defibrinated rabbit blood
                    overlaid with Schneider's medium containing 20% BSA and gentamycin. Cultures
                    were subpassaged into EMTM medium and successful isolation and characterization
                    was obtained for 18 stocks of flagellates (13 from R. rattus, 5 from R.
                    norvegicus). They were typed by electrophoretic patterns of 13 isoenzymes, using
                    Leishmania infantum promastigotes (MHOM/TN/80/IPTI) and Trypanosoma lewisi
                    trypomastigotes (MRAT/IT/??/ISSTO) as reference strains. All stocks were found
                    to be T. lewisi, but differing from the Italian reference strain (provisionally
                    designated as zymodeme 1) in 2 to 4 enzymes. Of these, MPI and IDH had identical
                    patterns in all Gozo stocks. Four zymodemes, provisionally designated as
                    zymodemes 2 and 3 (from Re norvegicus) 4 and 5 (from both rat species) were
                    found in this group. They differed in the mobility of PGM and ASAT. Three
                    different banding patterns for ASAT, for convenience called a, b, and c, were
                    observed in 2, 7 and 9 stocks, respectively. These patterns could be explained
                    in terms of a dimeric enzyme in a diploid organism; the single banded ASAT
                    variants, a and c, representing the homozygotes, and a large intermediate
                    (triple?) banded ASAT variant, b, the heterozygote. This may constitute the
                    first circumstancial evidence of genetic exchange in T. lewisi.</p>

                    clarifier le statut taxonomique et le comportement épidémiologique de ces
                    souches. Une extrême hétérogénéité génétique a été mise en évidence, de
                    nombreuses souches ne présentant aucun allèle commun. Seulement 3 groupements
                    ont pu être individualisés de façon fiable: (1) les 3 souches de cocotiers

                    souches d’euphorbes de l’Ancien monde. Ces résultats sont corroborés par des

                    tableau obtenu, qui demande à être confirmé par un échantillonnage plus vaste,

                <p>The taxonomy of Leishmania like other lower eucaryots,has been based on metabolic
                    and behavioral criteria that in time,have proven to be misleading. In recent
                    years ,the phylogeny of unicellular organisms is being reviewed using new tools
                    with solid evolu- tionary background. In this regard the ribosomal genes ocuppy
                    a central place since their evolutionary patterns are well documented,.e.g.
                    their primary sequence allows to establish distant phylogenetic relgtionships
                    ,whereas the ribosomal gene spacer permits to distinguish between close related

                    was used to obtain partial sequences of the small subunit rRNA (ssrRNA) of three
                    species of Eimeria: Eimeria maxima, Eimeria stiedai, and Eimeria tenella. These
                    sequences were aligned with the homologous ssrRNA sequence segments of a range
                    of other organisms in the phylum Apicomplexa, along with representatives of the
                    ciliates, fungi, flagellates, higher plants and higher eukaryotes. Two
                    phylogenetic tree building methods were used to investigate the phylogenetic
                    relationships among the Eimeria species, and between the Eimeria and the other
                    organisms represented, using Vairimorpha necatrix as an outgroup.</p>
                <p>Of the three species of Eimeria tested, the results showed that E. stiedai stands
                    apart from the other two species. This is in keeping with known facts concerning
                    the biology of these organisms. For example, host and site specificity are
                    strong characteristics of the Eimeria, with parasite development in general
                    occurring in epithelial cells of the the intestinal villi. E. stiedai is an
                    exception, developing in the epitheliali cells of the rabbit bile duct.</p>
                <p>Based on our previous results of partial ssrRNA sequencing, the phylum
                    Apicomplexa is a loose assemblage of taxa that may not be monophyletic. The
                    present analysis of ssrRNA sequences of Eimeria could not refute the hypothesis

                    trypanosomatid strains were classified on the basis of their kinetoplast DNA
                    restriction profiles (minicircle size, maxicircle and minicirele cleavage
                    patterns) and the results were compared with the taxonomic status of isolates
                    established previously by the morphological, ecological and .cultivational
                    criteria. The two Blastocrithidia species and the three Leptomonas were found to
                    constitute wo well sSeparated and internally homogeneous schizodemes. The third
                    one included a single Leptomonas species distinctly different from all the
                    isolates by all criteria. The fourth KkDNA group included 12 isolates with the
                    miscellaneous morphological properties and referred on this basis to the three
                    different genera. Though observed, the variability of the KkDNA structure within
                    this group was significantly less exhibited than that between the schizodemes,
                    being in any case scarcely consistent with the differences expected at the

                    The comparative analysis of the restriction endonuclease cleavage o kinetoplast
                    DNA from Leishmania species was performed. More than 45 isolates, including
                    L.gymnodactyli, L.adleri, L.major, L.tropica, L.infantum were analysed. It was
                    finally concluded that the cleavage Re . + . . 0 + - for atterms are mainl
                    species-specific. The maxicircle DNA sizes Re were” 32-38 Kbp and for Leishmania
                    - 26-27 Kbp. The extent of polymorphism of maxicircle DNA reduced n the
                    following succession: Sauroleishmanta species - L.infantum - L.major -
                    L.tropica. The KDNA cleavage pattern of the isolate L.sp ZMA {the agent of VL in
                    Georgia) was dissimilar to those of other VL agents, thus allowing to suggest
                    that this isolate represents a new species of Leishmania. The sum of evidence vs

                    origin, isolates obtained by excystation of human sources and isolates from
                    human and animal sources provided by others were characterised by isoenzyme and
                    DNA analysis. Isoenzyme analysis performed for 3 enzymes using
                    isoelectrofocussing gels, classified 50 isolates obtained from several European
                    laboratories in two groups. Isolates obtained by excystation from symptomatic
                    and asymptomatic hosts from Dutch hospitals on the other hand could be
                    classified in 9 groups. No correlation with clinical symptoms or geographical
                    origin could be detected.</p>
                <p>DNA probes were selected from DNA libraries of two isolates with different

                <p>Probes that hybridised to both (common) and to each of the isolates (specific)
                    were obtained. Restriction fragment polymorphism analysis using the common probe
                    classified all isolates in only two groups. Within each group almost complete
                    homogeneity was observed. Dot blot assays with the specific probes resulted in

                    Isoenzymatic analysis showed the presence of three main groups in Trichinella
                    nelsoni Britov and Boev, 1972: T3 present in the south-west area of the
                    Palearctic region, T7 and T8 respectively in the equatorial and southern area of
                    the Ethiopic region. Ir or- der to study the genetic differentiation at DNA
                    level of T3, T7 and T8 Trichinella isolates, their genomic DNA constitution was
                    analysed by the isolation of recombinant plasmides. The genomic library of the
                    T3 gene pool was built by Sau3A partial dige- stion. The DNA fragments were
                    inserted in PUCI13 vector plasmid and recombinant pla- smids were amplified in a
                    JM83 E.coli strain. Approximately, 500 recombinant colonies were picked out,
                    replicated on a filter three times and tested against x32p labelled DNA from T3,
                    T7 and T8. Hybridization was carried out at 65°C overnight. The compara- tive

                <p>Echinococcus multilocularis. Metacestodes. Intra-specific variation.</p>
                <p>There is a lack of documentation on intraspecific variations in E.multi-
                    locularis, even if morphology and experimental infectivity of metacestodes are
                    recognized as criteria for identification of Echinococcus strains.</p>
                <p>The purpose of this study was to compare 30 isolates recovered for most of them
                    from western Europe, but for others from Alaska, north USA or Japan, and
                    originated from human and animal intermediate or definitive hosts.</p>
                <p>They were maintained by repeated intraperitoneal transfers in Meriones
                    ungquiculatus. The macroscopical morphology of parasites, their fertility, the
                    sizes of protoscoleces and hooks were compared. Their infectivity was evaluated
                    by the capacity of development after inoculation in a naive host, ranging from
                    failure to successful infection, at various speeds, inducing the necessity of
                    more or less numerous periodic transfers.</p>
                <p>Except the lost (or the acquisition) of fertility during the first transfer in
                    M.unquiculatus, the characteristics of each isolate remained stable over 10
                    years. Differences were shown between isolates, but the variations were not
                    greater between isolates recovered from exotic foci than those recovered inside
                    the same micro-focus. Consequently, morphological methods and infectivity trials
                    cannot improve, when used alone, the knowledge of the epidemiological
                    significance of the variation in E.multilocularis.</p>

                <p>Leishmania, Kilobase, Karyotype Molecular techniques have been applied to
                    evaluate relationships among protozoan parasites, these include restriction

                    When genomic DNAs from World Health Oganisation leishmania reference strains:
                    Leishæanie major Is IC-235 and Leishmania major Ke IC-236, were digested with
                    restriction endonucleases Hind III, Hind II, BamHI, Pst I or EcoRI followed by
                    fractionation of the digests on 0.8-1% agarose gel electrophoresis, staining the
                    gels with ethidium bromide, the visualization under ultraviolet light revealed
                    prominent characteristic bands whose sizes were 0.5 kilobase for Leishmania
                    major Is IC-235 and 1.5 kilobases for Leishmania major Ke IC-236 indicating the
                    presence of repetitive DNA sequences. These fragments were isolated and cloned
                    in plasmid pUC-9. 0f the recombinant plasmids selected, tuo were chosen for use
                    in molecular hybridization with the blots of total DNAs from Leishmania major Is
                    IC-235 and Leishmanie major Ke 1C-236. The recombinant plasmid p1235-x
                    hybridizes exclusively with DNA from Leishmania major Is IC- 235 whereas p1236-5
                    does not hybridize with DNA from Leishmania major Is 1C-235, These results show
                    that Leishmania aajor Is IC-235 and Leishæania major Ke IC-236 which are
                    morphologically identical differ significantly from each other at the molecular
                    level. We have confirmed these findings by carrying out Keryotype experiments
                    Chromosome sized DNA molecules from Leishmania major Is IC-235 and Leishmania
                    major Ke IC-236 were fractionated by orthogonal field alternation gel
                    electrophoresis (OFAGE) or by field inversion gel electrophoresis (FIGE) using
                    appropriate apparatus. The chromosomal profiles shoved significant differences
                    among the tuo leishmania isolates: Leishmania major Is IC-235 and Leishmania
                    major Ke IC-236.</p>

                <p>Blastocystis hominis, Phylogenetic affinity, RNA sequence Blastocystis hominis,
                    Brumpt 1912, is an inhabitant of the human intestinal tract. The association of
                    this organism with human disease has been controversial. B. hominis js a
                    eukaryotic organism, but its taxonomic position is similarly uncertain. Recently
                    Zierdt suggested that it should be classified in protozoan (phylum
                    Sarcomastigophora, subphylum Sarcodina), but the classification has not been
                    accepted widely. Although B. hominis lacks definitive characteristics to
                    indicate its taxonomic position, B. hominis shows unique morphological
                    characteristics (eg. central vacuole). In the present paper, based on the
                    comparison of cytoplasmic 5$S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) sequence, a phylogenetic
                    analysis of B. hominis was performed. À strain of B. hominis has been isolated
                    from a patient with diarrhea and maïntaïned. The organisms were grown on
                    whole-egg slants overlaid with Locke's solution containing 20% bovine serum
                    under anaerobic condition at 37C. Crude RNA was extracted by the phenol method.
                    The 5S rRNA was isolated by electrophoresis on a /M urea-12% polyacrylamide gel,
                    and then sequenced by chemical and enzymatic methods. Secondary structure of B.
                    hominis 5S rRNA was essentially the same as the generally accepted eukaryotic
                    model. In order to estimate the phylogenetic position of B. hominis, the
                    sequence was compared with those of representative eukaryotes and a phylogenetic
                    tree was constructed by the simplified UPGMA (unweiïghted pair group average
                    clustering) method. Our conclusion is that B. hominis is not especially closely
                    related phylogenetically to any of eukaryotes whose sequences have been known
                    (Acanthamoeba castellanii, Pneumocystis carinii, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, and
                    so on).</p>

                    duodenalis of human, cat, sheep, rat, cattle, dog and beaver origin from five
                    countries were characterised by starch gel electrophoresis using thirteen enzyme
                    systems. Electrophoretic data were analysed to determine phenetic and
                    phylogenetic relationships between Giardia isolates. At least 30 different
                    zymodemes were detected with a considerable degree of genetic variation between
                    isolates, particu- larly from certain highly endemic areas of Australia. In
                    contrast, a number of isolates from different hosts and countries were found to
                    be closely related to the Portland isolate (ATCC 30888). The genetic
                    relationships between isolates determined by these analyses may provide

                <p>A multilocus enzyme electrophoretic analysis of Leishmania strains iso- lated
                    from patients in Nicaragua was performed. This analysis identi- fied strains of
                    both L.braziliensis and L. panamensis species. in addition some strains revealed
                    a heterozygotic pattern in many of the enzymes analyzed. The constant presence
                    of the heterozygotic pattern in the enzymes of these strains, particularly in
                    dimeric enzymes suh as 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase, was consistent with the
                    interpreta- tion that these strains were hybrids of the diploid parental species
                    and not naturally occurring mixtures.</p>
                <p>These strains were further analyzed by species specific monoclonal anti- bodies,
                    schizodeme analysis of kDNA and karyotyping by CHEF-DR electro- phoresis. The
                    hybrids reacted with L.braziliensis complex specific antibodies however most of
                    these strains did not react with L.brazili- ensis or L. panamensis species
                    specific monoclonals. The results from KDNA analysis showed a complex banding
                    pattern in the hybrids while the chromosome analysis was inconclusive. The
                    occurrence of these hybrids suggests either an ancient recombination event and
                    clonal propagation or current sexuality. These hypotheses are being

                    - Fingerprint - Oligonucleotide probe Few studies have been made about genetics
                    of cestode parasites. One of the reasons for this is that species of these
                    parasites have not shown clear intraspecific polymorphisms. As cestodes are
                    hermaphroditic,they have scarcely allowed us hybridization(mating) experiment.
                    Hence, for the purpose of genetic analysis, it is important to establish markers
                    to identify polymorphisms of cestodes. In our laboratory, one strain of
                    Hymenolepis nana has been used to study physiological and immunological natures.
                    In the series of experiment, this strain of H.nana showed some different
                    appearances from those reported previously. It is not clear whether these
                    differences arise from genetic variations or not (discrep- ancies in
                    experimental conditions etc.). Since it was necessary to establish essential
                    genetic markers, we tried fingerprinting of total DNASs extracted from adult
                    cestodes, Polymorphic marker used was oligonuclcotide probe. Detection of the
                    band patterns was performed by colorimetric method of
                    digoxigenin-anti-digoxigenin system. As a first step, interspecific difference
                    of DNA fingerprint was investigated among three species of genus Hymenolepis:
                    H.nana, H.microstoma and H.diminuta. Moreover, intraspecific variation was
                    studied about two strains of each, H.diminuta and H.nana.</p>

                <p>Mallophaga are ectoparasite insects. They live during all their developmental
                    stages on birds and mammals. Their relative high specificity for their hosts
                    and, especially, their morphological and biometric features, are the basis on
                    which the specialists on the taxonomy of this arthropod group work.
                    Nevertheless, there are cases in which the identification of lice, paying
                    attention to these criteria, is problematic.</p>
                <p>The objective of our investigation is to apply techniques complementing those
                    used traditionally in the taxonomy of these ectoparasites. In our study we have
                    obtained and analyzed the electrophoregrams of adult specimen of some
                    Degeeriella species. The methodology used was, basically, that described by
                    LAEMMLI (1970) (SDS- PAGE), adapted for slab gels, As standard proteins we used:
                    phosphorylase b, bovine albumin, ovalbumin, trypsinogen and lysozyme, Gels were
                    stained with Coomassie Blue R- 250. The proteic fractions were characterized by
                    means of their absolute electromobi- lity, relative electromobility and
                    molecular weight. The number of bands were larger in females than in males, The
                    molecular weights of these bands ranged from 428.000 d to 14.000 d, with
                    electromobilities of 6 mm and 125 mm, respectively. Electrophoreg- rams of the
                    different species were compared, and a similarity index (SORENSEN'S Index)
                    betwen them was obtained, It ranged from 24 7 to 97 7.</p>

                    kinetoplast DNA, minicircles, DNA sequencing, Crithidia oncopelti We cloned and
                    sequenced a full-length minicircle from Crithidia oncopelti, a representative of
                    ‘lower' trypanosomatids. Certain conserved minicircle sequence elements (e.g.
                    bent helical region, replication origins) are present in the cloned minicircle.
                    About one third of its length represents an extremely (T+G) vs (A+C) strand
                    biased region with unknown function. No significant sequence homology between
                    C.oncopelti minicircle and minicircles of C.fasciculata was found. The overall
                    structural organization of the cloned C.onco elti minicirele is rather similar
                    to that of ‘higher' trypanosomatiäs (Leïlshmania sp., Trypanosoma brucei) than
                    to the dimeric minicircles of C. fasciculata.</p>

                    B.</p>
                <p>xylophilus from North America and Japan was investigated using DNA analysis of a
                    range of isolates. Genomic DNA fragments of the parents and of the reciprocal
                    hybrids of B.</p>
                <p>xylophilus and B. mucronatus were Southern blotted and hybridized to a hsp7/70A
                    gene and the ribosomal gene cluster from one of the isolates. The resulting band
                    patterns show genomic differences between B. xylophilus and B. mucronatus.
                    Hybrids from B. xylophilus parents show DNA band patterns in common with both
                    parental isolates whereas hybrids of the French and Japanese B. mucronatus show
                    DNA band patterns similar to that of the French B. mucronatus. The DNA analysis
                    along with behavioural, cross-hybridization and pathogenicity experiments
                    confirm that B. xylophilus isolates from North America and Japan are distinctly
                    different from the French and Japanese B. mucronatus isolates. As well, the data
                    shows that the putative French and Japanese isolates of B. mucronatus are not
                    the same species.</p>

                <p>The biological characterization of a nicaraguan isolate (Nicaragua-l) of T.cruzi
                    was carried out by in-vivo and in-vitro studies.</p>
                <p>The.isolate was obtained from Triatoma dimidiata captured in the depar fnenè of
                    En Nicaragua. Male mice of C3H/He and C57BL/6 strains were inoculated with 104,
                    10 and 10°Trypomastigotes/ml from the first passage in BESM cells. Studied
                    parameters were: the course of parasitemia, determined by wet film and
                    quantified än a Neubauer chamber; anti- T. cruzi antibody levels, determined by
                    IFA and ELISA; mortality in the acute stage of the infection, and spontaneous
                    biotransformation in culture. Parasitemia was detected in both strains of mice
                    with all the inocula. The prepatent periods varied with the size of the
                    inoculum. Within each strain of mice the period became shorter as the number of
                    infected parasites increased. In both strains the levels of parasitemia were
                    higher with greater sizes of the inocula. Mice infected with 10° parasites/ml
                    attained peaks at 14 d.p.i, with parasitemäüas greater than 10° parasites/ml in
                    70% of C3H and 30% of C57. All of the C3H inoculated with 10° and 106
                    parasites/ml while 20% and 70% respectively of the C57 died in the acute stage
                    of the infection. However the surviving time of the C3H inoculated with 106
                    parasites/ml was shorter tham that of the säme strain of mice inoculated with
                    10° parasites/ml and of the C57 injected with 10° parasites/ml. These results
                    show that the infection produced by the Nicaragüa I isolate depends of the
                    number of parasites and of the strain of the mouse.</p>

                <p>Surveys of 332 naturally infected bovines at eight abattoirs in Senegal, The
                    Gambia and Mali were carried out to determine the prevalence of infection with
                    Schistosoma bovis and S. curassoni and to pinpoint areas where the distribution
                    of the species overlap.</p>
                <p>S. bovis was the commonest schistosome of cattle in Senegal and Mali being found
                    in animals at seven abattoirs, the highest prevalence of 85.1% occurred at Mopti
                    in Mali.</p>
                <p>S. bovis was the only bovine schistosome observed in The Gambia. S. curassoni was
                    isolated from a cow at Bamako and shown to have similar glucose 6-phosphate
                    dehydrogenase, phosphoglucomutase and acid phosphatase profiles to those
                    described for a Senegalese isolate. Evidence of interaction of S. bovis with S.
                    curassoni was found in cattle from Senegal, at Tambacounda and Kolda, and from
                    Mali, at Bamako and Mopti. A mixed experi- mental infection of both species in a
                    sheep showed the lack of any specific mate recognition system: identification of
                    the worms was faciliated by analysis of acid phosphatase by isoelectric focusing
                    in polyacrylamide gels. Viable hybrid parasites were produced in the laboratory
                    and were maintained up until the FA generation.</p>

                <p>Anopheles darlingi Root, 1926 is the principal malaria vector in Brazil. Variable
                    behaviour, mainly in endophily and exophily, and chromosomal variations, led to
                    the suspicion that darlingi could be a complex of cryptic species, with clear
                    implications for malaria epidemiology.</p>
                <p>Captures using human bait were carried out in 3 localities in Brazil: Juturnafba,
                    Rio de Janeiro State ( a place 60 km from the type-locality, Porto das Caixas);
                    Dourado, Säo Paulo State (a population with marked exophily) and Costa Marques,
                    Rondônia State (a malaria endemic area). Females were dried and conserved in
                    silica gel for analysis of their cuticular hydrocarbons. Analyses were made
                    using a gas-liquid chromatography apparatus for qualitative and quantitative
                    hydrocarbon comparison among the 3 populations using hexane extracts of 65
                    females (average) per locality. Peaks in chromatograms were numbered and their
                    concentration used for deiermining whether there are significant differences
                    between sets of data using Manova - multivariate analysis of variance. These
                    differences were characterized by assigning weights to the hydrocarbons by
                    Discriminant Analysis.</p>
                <p>A jacknifed estimator of correct classification (F—10,0) gave the following
                    results: 92.4% of the specimens were correctly identified as from Costa Marques,
                    91.2% as from Dourado, but only 61.3% were correctly classified as Juturnafba
                    (overall correct separation of 82.1%). The results shows that populations from
                    Costa Marques and Dourado can be clearly distinguished. We intend to study
                    chromosomal and isoenzymatical patterns of these populations for a better

                <p>Trichinella spiralis, sylvatic, genomic DNA, prevalence Initial work has shown
                    that Trichinella spiralis exists in several wildlife hosts in central Illinois
                    (USA). Subsequent studies have monitored the prevalence, intensity and
                    biological characteristics of several of these sylvatic isolates of T. spiralis
                    and forms the basis of this report. Tongue muscle was collected from 1985-1989
                    from 7/03 raccoons, 27 red fox and 21 coyote. Pepsin-HCL digestions were
                    performed to determine larval intensities and were expressed as larvae/gram
                    (1/8) of tissue. Fourteen of 703 (2%) raccoons were positive for T. spiralis
                    with a mean larval intensity of 180 1/g (S.D.=256 1/g; range=1-760). Two of 21
                    (9.57%) coyote (mean=29 1/g; S.D.=28; range=9-49) and 4 of 27 (15%) red fox
                    (mean=9.9 1/g; S.D.=15.4; range=1-33) were also positive for T. spiralis. Two
                    raccoon isolates of T. spiralis were maintained in Balb/c mice, their DNA
                    isolated and compared to DNA from other T. spiralis genotypes using restriction
                    fragment length polymorphisms of repetitive DNA sequences. Southern blots of Dra
                    I digested genomic DNA screened with radiolabeled total RNA revealed a distinct
                    banding pattern of ribosomal DNA that was characteristic for the raccoon
                    isolates and was not indicative of the pig T. spiralis genotype. Furthermore,
                    DNA from the raccoon isolates did not interact with a DNA probe (pBP 2) specific
                    for pig type T. spiralis. These results provide additional information on the
                    distribution of this parasite in sylvatic hosts in the central United States and
                    further indicate that T. spiralis exists as a genetically heterogeneous complex

                <p>Nous proposons une théorie générale sur l’importance de la reproduction clonale
                    chez les protozoaires parasites, qui a des conséquences taxonomiques et
                    médicales considérables. Une reproduction sexuée notable ou prédominante a été
                    récemment inférée pour beaucoup de ces parasites, du fait d’indices de
                    diploïdie, ou d’expériences de recombinaison génétique couronnées de succés.
                    Cependant, une analyse de génétique des populations menée chez les populations
                    naturelles de ces parasites montre chez elles l’apparente rareté où absence des
                    deux conséquences fondamentales de la reproduction sexuée (ségrégation et
                    recombinaison). De plus, les clones identifiés apparaissent stables dans
                    l’espace et dans le temps, même à l’échelle évolutive. Il apparait donc
                    souhaitable d’étudier séparément les propriétés médicalement importantes de ces
                    clones (qui constituent autant d’"agamospecies"), en donnant la priorité aux
                    clones ubiquistes ("clones majeurs").</p>
                <p>Le "clone naturel" mis en évidence par la génétique des populations constitue
                    l’unité évolutive la plus rationnelle, venant compléter et moduler utilement une
                    taxonomie linnéenne peu satisfaisante dans le cas de ces organismes.</p>

                <p>L'analyse génétique de 21 loci a révélé seulement 5 loci variables qui ont permis
                    d'individualiser 5 zymo- dèmes. Deux de ces zymodèmes regroupent des souches

                    foyers. Ceci confirmerait les données épidémiologiques de Noireau et coll. qui
                    soulignent par ailleurs une trés faible prévalence des infections à Trypanozoon

                    evolution Trypanosoma cruzi small subunit ribosomal RNA molecules (SSU rRNA)
                    exhibit a slower electrophoretic mobility than their homologous from
                    vertebrates. T. cruzi SSU rRNA gene was sequenced from genomic recombinant
                    plasmid clones. The assigned coding region was 2319 bp which represent to our
                    knowledge the longest SSU rRNA gene described to date. On the basis of sequence
                    comparisons with published sequences from other kinetoplastids, we conclude that
                    the extra nucleotides in T. cruzi gene occur in highly variable regions of the
                    rRNA genes. T. cruzi gene substitutions analysed in a secondary structure rRNA
                    model, indicate a strong conservation in the so called universal core. A
                    phylogenetic analysis of this family of organisms indicate that the actual
                    branching order of Trypanosoma species can not be unequivocally determined.</p>

                    approfondie de la variabilité génétique (isoenzymes) deTrypanosoma cruzi a
                    montré que les populations naturelles de ce parasites sont constituées de
                    nombreux clones génétiquement très diversifiés dont certains sont fréquents et
                    ubiquistes (‘clones majeurs”). Dans ce travail, des sondes d'ADN spécifiques de
                    plusieurs clones majeurs ont été élaborées.</p>
                <p>La Réaction de Polymérisation en Chaîne (PCR) a été utilisée pour amplifier les
                    régions variables (250 bp) des minicercles de l'ADN kinétoplastique (ADNK,
                    extranucléaire). Ces séquences ainsi générées à partir de souches différentes
                    après 30 cycles ont été purifiées et triées pour être utilisées comme sondes.
                    Les différentes séquences ont été radio-marquées et hybridées sur un vaste
                    échantillonnage d'ADNSs préalablement transférés sur membranne de nylon (‘slot

                    avérées être des sondes spécifiques de clones. La sensibilité et la spécificité
                    de ces sondes a été également testée dans différents prélèvements

                <p>D'une façon générale, des sondes peuvent être produites (I) pour détecter des

                    (ii) pour identifier des populqgtions parasitaires préalablement caractérisées
                    sur des bases de génétique des populations. C'est la deuxièmme approche que nous
                    avons adoptée. Compte tenu de la structure de l'ADN k et de son parallelisme

                    sondes spécifique des clones. Ces sondes constituent un instrument prometteur
                    pour comparer les propriétés épidémiologiques et médicales des clones majeurs de

                    Nematode - Population structure Studies currently underway in this laboratory
                    are concerned with the genetics of S. ratti. As part of this work twelve British
                    isolates and a single American isolate have been analysed for genetic variation
                    using isoenzyme and two dimensional electrophoresis. The isoenzyme
                    electrophoresis results have shown complete homogeneity between all of these
                    isolates.</p>
                <p>Previous studies of Strongyloides spp. from primates including man, using the
                    same methods, have shown very high levels of heterogeneity both within and
                    between populations. Preliminary results from the two dimensional
                    electrophoresis studies of the same S. ratti isolates have revealed a small
                    number of differences between the isolates although a high level of inter-
                    isolate homogeneity is still apparent. These preliminary results taken together
                    would suggest that there is less genetic variation within S. ratti compared to
                    species of Strongyloides from primates. It remains to be seen whether such a
                    population structure in S. ratti is a result of the genetic mechanisms involved
                    in its life-cycle.</p>

                    Isoenzyme, Trichomonas hominis Trichomonas hominis infection is a very common
                    intestinal parasitic disease in China especially in rural areas causing diarrhea
                    mostly in children. Li et al examined 274 stool samples of patients with
                    diarrhea in rural areas in Hebei province, trophozoi- tes of T. hominis were
                    found in 26 of them, and the positive rate was 9.48%. Sheep blood liquid medium
                    was used to cultivate and isolate these parasites. Altogether 7 strains of T.
                    hominis have been isolated for this study. Lysates of parasites were prepared
                    and kept in the liquid nitrogen tank as lysate beads for isoenzyme study.</p>
                <p>The isoenzyme patterns of 3 enzymes of these 7 strains were studied by cellulose
                    acetate electrophoresis with the techniques introduced by Lanham et al with some
                    modifications, The three isoenzymes studied were MDH (E.C. 1.1.1.37), HK (E.C.
                    2,7.1.1 ) and GPI (E.C. 1.3.1.9). All isoenzyme patterns were same in all
                    strains in MDH and HK, but isoenzyme pattern of GPI in one of them was slightly
                    different from other 6 strains. The possible significance in the study of
                    geographic difference in strains of ZT, hominis has been discussed and needs
                    further studies.</p>

                    The changing epidemiology of Schistosoma mansoni and S. haematobium in Egypt is
                    generally attributed to the presence of the Aswan Dam. Both S. mansoni and
                    S.</p>
                <p>haematobium are now prevalent in Upper and Lower Egypt and patients with double
                    infections occur in both areas. S. mansoni eggs are shed almost exclusively in
                    the stools of patients with double infection in Lower Egypt, while S. mansoni
                    eggs are frequently shed in the urine of doubly infected patients in Upper
                    Egypt. To determine if there were biochemical differences in S. mansoni strains
                    from Upper and Lower Egypt, isoenzyme profiles by isoelectric focusing, protein
                    patterns by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting were done on extracts of laboratory
                    maintained male and female adult worms. There were no differences in the S.
                    mansoni from Upper and Lôwer Egypt. In vivo and in vitro cross mating studies
                    between S. mansoni and S. haematobium, using snails infected with single
                    miracidium, revealed males of each species successfully (80%) mate with females
                    of the other species. In vivo, these females showed developed ovaries and laÿed
                    viable eggs. The determinants of paired worm migration to specific anatomical
                    areas of the infected human is not well defined. If the species of the male worm
                    is a primary factor, patients with established infections which are
                    predominantly S. haematobium (Upper Egypt) may have a preponderance of these
                    males mated with S. mansoni females which then migrate to the vesical plexus
                    where mansoni eggs are deposited in the bladder and shed in the urine.</p>

                <p>Gene polymorphism - environmental variation - adaptation In a previous paper, the
                    genetic structure of seventeen ascaridoid species having different life cycle
                    was compared by multilocus electrophoresis, in order to test if their genetic
                    variation is positively related to the degree of environmental heterogenei- ty
                    they experience (Bullini et al., 1986). It was found that species whose life
                    cycle is carried out on a single homeothermic host show on average lower genetic
                    variability than do those needing both poikilothermic and homeothermic
                    hosts.</p>
                <p>In the present study the genetic variation at 16 enzyme loci was analyzed in ten
                    further multiple-host ascaridoid species:Phocascaris phocae, Contracaecum
                    osculatum C, C.</p>
                <p>osculatum D, C.osculatum E, C.septentrionale, C.microcephalum, C.micropapillatum,
                    Pseu- doterranova decipiens À, P.decipiens B, and P.decipiens C. The
                    heterozygosity obtained for these species is on average lower than that found
                    for the multiple-host species pre- viously analyzed: He-0.09 instead of 0.15.
                    This is due to the lower genetic variability found in some of the species
                    tested, e.g. Pseudoterranova decipiens C (He=0.02). Differ- ences in population
                    size, degree of inbreeding, bottleneck events, time and mode of spe- ciation can
                    account for the discrepancies found between multiple-host ascaridoid
                    species.</p>
                <p>On the other hand, heterozygosity remains on average significantly higher than
                    that found for single-host ascaridoid worms (He=0.04), suggesting a major role
                    of natural selection in this phenomenon.</p>

                <p>Supraspecific systematics - isoenzymes - genetic divergence The genetic
                    relationships among twelve species belonging to the genera Contracaecum
                    (C.septentrionale, C.rudolphii A and B, C.microcephalum, C.micropapillatum,
                    C.osculatum A,B,C,D, and E) and Phocascaris (P.phocæ, P.cystophoraæ) were
                    investigated by electrophoretic analysis of 16 enzyme loci. The results obtained
                    confirm the genetic heterogeneity of the genus Contracaecum (Orecchia et al.,
                    1986). The Contracaecum species having seals as definitive hosts appear to be
                    genetically closely related to each other (Nei's genetic distance, D, from 0.25
                    to 0.69), wnile they are differentiated at all the loci tested from the
                    congeneric species parasitizing birds (D=c° ). On the other hand, Phocascaris
                    species are genetically closely related to Contracaecum species having, like
                    them, seals as definitive hosts (D from 0.27 to 0.53). These data strongly
                    support Berland's hypothesis (Berland, 1964), according to which the
                    Contracaecum species that have seals as definitive host should be included in a
                    same genus with Phocascaris species. Due to the poor phylogenetic value of the
                    character "'interlabia presence/absence!'', a redescription of the genera
                    Contracaecum and Phocascaris appears much needed.</p>

                    Transmission A number of parasitic nematodes develop beyond what one would
                    expect in intermediate hosts. This phenomenon has been called precocity and is
                    defined as "growth and/a development beyond the expected'' (Anderson, R.C. 1988,
                    J. Parasit. 74: 30-45). The nematode may remain in the expected stage (e.g. the
                    third-stage in the secernenteans) but exhibit unusual growth of the body and/or
                    development of the reproductive system.</p>
                <p>In some species development proceeds beyond the expected stage and even up to the
                    adult stage (extreme precocity) in the intermediate host. Precocity may often be
                    associated with final host behaviour which restricts transmission to reduced
                    limits of time and space. It may function to accelerate gamete production in the
                    final host especially in those final hosts which are migratory and spend only
                    short periods of time in areas where transmission occurs. In addition, extreme
                    precocity might have been a mechanism whereby some nematodes have transferred
                    between hosts (i.e. ‘'captured'"', for definition see Chabaud, A.G. 1981,
                    Parasitology, 82: 169-170, 172-174). Examples of precocity in the secernentean
                    and adenophorean nematodes parasite of vertebrates will be presented and related
                    to final host behaviour as it concerns transmission.</p>

                <p>Le genre Cercopithifilaria Eberhard, 1980 prend un intérêt particulier car il
                    constitue avec le genre Monanema Anteson, 1968 le groupe de filaires parasites
                    de Mammifères dont les microfilaires sont dermiques et qui constitue de bons
                    modèles pour la pathogénie de l'onchocercose. On connaît mal le spectre d'hôtes
                    de Monanema, car les adultes sont difficiles à trouver (M.martini vit dans les
                    lymphatiques de la paroi du tube digestif). Le spectre d'hôtes de
                    Cercopithifilaria commence à être bien connu; il est très remarquable car il
                    renferme une vingtaine d'espèces parasites d'hôtes variés (Carnivores, Primates,
                    Bovidés, Cervidés, Lagomorphes, Muridés, Marsupiaux), répartis dans le monde
                    entier. En plus de la morphologie, l'unité du genre est attestée par le fait que
                    le vecteur est toujours un Ixodoidea. La biologie particulière de ces
                    Arthropodes (grandes longévité et capacité de dissémination, cycles à plusieurs
                    hôtes) paraît expliquer pourquoi, contrairement à la règle génèrale des

                    (Filarioidea: Dirofilariinae) and Eulimdana spp. (Filarioidea: Lemdaninae) are
                    the only filarioids known that produce skin-inhabiting microfilariae (MF) in
                    birds. Adults of P. fulicaeatrae occur near the ankle of Fulica americana
                    (Gruiformes: Rallidae) in North America and MF occur primarily in leg skin; the
                    louse Pseudomenopon pilosum (Amblycera) is the vector. Adults of Eulimdana spp.
                    occur in the neck of numerous species of shorebirds (Charadriiformes:
                    Scolopacidae) in North America and MF occur primarily in head, neck, and wing
                    skin; lice in the genera Austromenopon or Actornithophilus (Amblycera) are the
                    presumed vectors. In both P. fulicaeatrae and Eulimdana spp., natural selection
                    may have shortened the period of MF production in female worms. Female P.
                    fulicaeatrae apparently undergo early reproductive senescence and adult
                    Eulimdana spp. apparently are short-lived. These modifications would be
                    advantageous if they prevent supersaturation of the bird's skin with MF and thus
                    reduce the probability that vectors ingest fatally high numbers of MF. The
                    latter may be a problem particularly relevant to vectors such as lice that are
                    permanent ectoparasites and, therefore, apt repeatedly to ingest MF.</p>

                    taken off the coast of New Zealand. The comparatively large body of the worm (up
                    to 19mm long by 8.5mm wide) is packed with transverse uterine loops filled with
                    large numbers of aeveloping larvae.</p>
                <p>The vitellaria are relatively scanty and the egg shells are thin and colourless.

                    loops containing relatively few thick-shelled, dark brown eggs. The vitellaria
                    are well developed, dense follicles. When the eggs are expelled through the

                    Only the emergence of eucaryotic organisms accelerated evoiution, with possibly
                    decisive role of parasitism in the evolution. Ferasite-host contact would result
                    in four major conse- quences: agitation of contradiction between the two
                    organisms, introduction of new genes into the host organism, elimination of
                    weakened hosts, and/or establishment of symbiotic relations between the
                    organisms. In the latter case the consequence would transform into function and
                    over many genera- tions the parasite would entirely (unicelluiar) or in part
                    (gene complex in a multicellular) convert into à component of the host. À
                    different parasite invasion would follow a similar path. In fact the described
                    process is con- tinuous. The lymphoid system in animals shouid have been induced
                    by para- sites, and since then they have been the only suppliers of the natural
                    antigenes inducing production of natural immunoglobulins important for the host

                <p>C.echinata is supplied with different morphological structures for swimming,
                    orientation, protection, energy supply, host recognition penetration,
                    localization and encystment. All these functions are managed by the very well
                    organized nervous system which is described in à separate paper. Thia paper
                    follows the nervous system of C.echinata after its meta- morphosal development
                    into a metacercaria, pre-adult and adult worm. The results showed that the
                    internal nervous elements of C.echinata such as ganglia, neurons and main ner-
                    vous stems remaind unchenged during its encystation into mctacercaria and
                    excystation in pre-adult and adult. In addition to them many new longitudinal
                    and transf-rsal commissu- res developed into the prolongated second half of the
                    body where ovary, testes and other organs are drowing. Contrary to the internal,
                    the external and the integumentary nervous elements of C.echinata such as
                    sensory hills, craters, holes, papillae and cillia changed sharply in the
                    metacercaria, pre-adult and adult. These nervous which have been well de-
                    veloped in the cercaria quickly reduced and disappeared in the metacercaria,
                    pre-adult and adult and vice versa those which have been poorly
                    developed-improved. Reduction and improvement took place simultaneously at one
                    and the same time in one and the same or- gans. For example in the ventral and
                    the oral sucker the improvement is found in the pa- pillae situated on thcir
                    lips area, while these located inside dissappered. In the head collar all
                    sensory hills, craters, holes, long cillia, double and large papillae comple-
                    tely disappear but at the same time a new type of papillae occured arround the
                    collar spines. The above mentioned morphological transformations of the nervous
                    elements were found in all cercariae, metacercariae, pre-adults and adults
                    studied. Obviously they are genetically based and firmly connected with the life
                    cycle pattern of C.echinata and its physiology and ecology, especially with the
                    so call behaviour and attraction.</p>

                    mechanism of its stabi- lity and functioning.Strongylidae are members of a
                    simple (two - member) multicomponent (above 50 species ) parasitic system which
                    combines rela- ted host species and has a certain fluctuation of the species
                    diversity in different populations.As an alloxenic species formation is a
                    leading one ,the divergence of Strongylidae reflects that of hosts.Taking into
                    ac- count an ecological connection of Strongylidae with vegetation of pastu- res
                    it may be supposed that the community is connected by its roots with a system of
                    "Anchitherinae - Strongylidae" from which the genera Gyaloce.</p>
                <p>phalus and Tridentoinfundibulum may be originated.Relation between Stron gylidae
                    and hosts are observed as full in obligate herbivorousforms of Equinae in whom
                    different Strongylidae lines arise in parallel from an- cestors that are on the
                    level of the Cyathostominae organization. When ration processes the taxonomic
                    diversity of parasites has grown.Intepra- tion and migration of tridactyl and
                    monodactyl horses throush the Berin- gia have led to cumulation and depletion of
                    the community.That ïis why the present level of the taxononic diversity of

                    suggested that expression of secondary sexual characters was positively related
                    to an individual's ability to resist parasites. Assuming heritability in such
                    resistance, females that choose mates with exaggerated sex traits, would select
                    parasite resistant genes for their future offspring. But how do parasites affect
                    the expression of sex traits? We present a phenomenological model of the effect
                    of parasitism on the development of vertebrate secondary sexual characteristics
                    and sexual selection; a model that refers to an intraspecific level mechanism,
                    operating on both an ecological and evolutionary time scale. The special role of
                    testosterone, with its two-pronged effect on immunosuppression and the
                    expression of secondary sexual characters, is discussed. This model incorporates
                    an essential element to the extant parasite-sexual selection controversy by
                    integrating well documented, empirical evidence from relevant, yet diverse,

                    sporocyst of Opishioglyphe ranae and Echinoparyphium recurvatum.</p>
                <p>In the sporocyst the central nerve ganglion, in form of a ring conical in lateral
                    view, occurs in the narrowed end of the body (proximal to snail tissue). It is
                    situated between the body surface and the inner cavity, in the body wall
                    thickened in this place.</p>
                <p>Several neurons are seen attached to the ring as well as nerve fibres running out
                    of its base. The fibres spread over the body of the sporocyst and join
                    themselves forming a net. Here and there cell bodies are attached to the fibres,
                    more numerous toward the posterior end.</p>
                <p>The redia shows a well developed "brain" similar to that of the cercaria,
                    composed of two lateral ganglia connected dorsally by a thick, well pronounced
                    commissure and ventrally by a thin one seen only in some positions. Several
                    nerve fibres run anteriad from the ganglia, around the pharynx, and join
                    together in a ring surrounding the oral opening. The number of these nerves is
                    difficult to precise. Toward the posterior end two pairs of nerve stems arise
                    from the ganglia - a pair of dorsal, and a pair of ventro-lateral ones. The
                    latter divide after a short course into ventral and lateral stems. At one third
                    of the body these stems split into fibres which anastomose and form a loose net
                    spreading up to the body end. Posterior to the nerve ganglia, à well pronounced
                    transverse commissure is situated, innervating the collar of the redia.</p>

                    guildes de parasites branchiaux de Cyprinidae d'Afrique occidentale. La
                    comparaison entre la phylogénie des hôtes et celle de leurs parasites met en
                    évidence: 1) des phénomènes co-évolutifs dans lesquels la spéciation des hôtes
                    conduit à une spéciation parallèle de leurs parasites; 2) des phénomènes de
                    captures parasitaires entre hôtes phylétiquement apparentés. Les Cyprinidae des
                    bassins isolés de Guinée possèdent une parasitofaune branchiale homologue
                    d’origine très ancienne résultant de processus assimilables à une co-évolution.
                    A l'inverse, les hôtes des grands fleuves sahélo-soudaniens sont marqués par une
                    parasitofaune plus jeune, résultat de remaniements récents par phénomènes de
                    captures et recaptures. Dans ce dernier cas, la structure des guildes de
                    Monogènes répond aux prédictions de la "théorie des îles": le nombre d'espèces
                    parasites est fonction de la taille maximale de l’espèce-hôte (la corrélation
                    établie explique 70 % de la variabilité observée). La structure des communautés
                    parasitaires peut ainsi s'expliquer par deux modèles, non plus en opposition
                    mais complémentaire s'appliquant selon les conditions d'isolement des hôtes.</p>

                <p>Digenea - Evolution and cladistics The neorhabdocoel sister group and the
                    dalyelioid-like ancestor are so remote that a detailed hypothesis of the
                    evolution of parasitism and life-cycle is required in order to identify most
                    plesiomorphic character-states and character-state trees, and to apply cladistic
                    analysis to reveal the phylogeny and classification of digenean families. The
                    hypothetical ancestral digenean life-cycle probably included a number of
                    ovoviviparous adult generations in the gut of a marine mollusc alternating with
                    a free swimming ovi- parous adult. Penetration from the gut into the haemolymph
                    resulted in paedomorphosis and the adoption of apomictic parthenogenesis by the
                    parasite generations (mother sporocyst and rediae). Later, the free swimming
                    adult was swallowed and, with com- paratively little modification, became
                    parasitic in the gut of a fish. Subsequently the juvenile (cercaria) leaving the
                    primary (molluscan) host developed a furcocercous tail to facilitate transfer to
                    the final (fish) host. Some species further evolved by (i) pro- gressive
                    paedomorphosis producing daughter sporocysts, (ii) encystment, (iii) the
                    acquisition of, and increasing maturation in, an intermediate host, (iv) the
                    development of suckers and (v) a reduction in vitellaria and egg size and the
                    loss of a free swimming miracidium. This hypothesis and cladistic analysis
                    translates into a phylogeny which divides the Digenea into two subclasses
                    defined by basic tail form and the nature of encystment.</p>

                <p>Amia calva, a relict palaeozoic fish endemic to North America, is the host of
                    Haplobothrium globuliforme, chosen by the late Prof. J.G. Baer as the ancestral
                    cestode from which all the Eucestoda arose. A. calva is also host to another
                    cestode of evolutionary interest, Proteocephalus perplexus, recently studied by
                    us. In contrast to the oviparous H. globuliforme, P. perplexus is a viviparous
                    cestode producing oncospheres. Calanoid copepods become infected with the
                    cercoscolex larva if they ingest oncospheres. The cercoscolex larva shows a
                    single invagination of the scolex into the neck region and also shows both the
                    microvillar tegument of the distinct cercomer as well as the microtrichal
                    tegument of the scolex and neck region.</p>
                <p>The adult oviparous H. globuliforme and viviparous P. perplexus also have
                    important features shared by other oviparous and viviparous cestodes. The
                    oviparous cestodes (Pseudophyllidea and Tetrarhynchidea) possess: a
                    non-acetabulate scolex; cortical vitellaria; a coracidium, with protonephridia,
                    which develops within an operculate egg shell; and a hexacanth embryo that
                    develops into a procercoid. The viviparous cestodes (Proteocephala and
                    Tetraphyllidea) possess: an acetabulate scolex; medullary and lateral
                    vitellaria; oncospheres without protonephridia; and a cercoscolex type of larva
                    that develops from the hexacanth embryo.</p>
                <p>Proteocephalus perplexus with its four protruding lobes of the scolex, each of
                    which terminates in a sucker, may be regarded as the ancestral form for both the
                    Tetraphyllidea of cartilaginous fishes and the Proteocephala of bony fishes.</p>
                <p>Similarly, H. globuliforme with its distinctive scolex and pseudoscolex, may be
                    regarded as the ancestral form for both the Tetrarhynchidea of cartilaginous
                    fishes and the Pseudophyllidea of bony fishes. The assumption, that oviparity
                    and viviparity of contemporary cestodes was established before the migration of
                    freshwater Selachians to the sea, is discussed.</p>

                    media (MEM; 5% FBS). Addition of 20 ug/ml haemin to 0.5X MEM did not promote
                    growth. On passage from unsupplemented blood-agar media to that supplemented
                    with equi-osmolal quantities of one of NaCl, NaBr, Na- acetate, KC1, choline-Cl
                    or sucrose, growth of established cultures decreased and the flagellates
                    transformed from 12% to 92% trypomastigotes; equi-osmolal urea had no effect on

                    le spicule. L'intestin débouche dans l'appareil génital, généralement au niveau
                    du canal éjaculateur. L'importance relative du sphincter, du canal éjaculateur
                    et du cloaque varie selon les groupes. Chez les Capillariinae parasites de
                    Poissons ou d'Amphibiens étudiés ici, le canal éjaculateur est très court ou
                    indistinct de la vésicule séminale. Chez les Capillariinae de Mammifères, la
                    tendance est à un allongement du canal éjaculateur; l'intestin s'insère au
                    niveau de la partie postérieure du canal éjaculateur. Chez un parasite
                    d'Oiseaux, le canal éjaculateur est court mais le cloaque est très allongé. A
                    partir d'un canal éjaculateur primitif court, il semble donc y avoir eu
                    évolution dans deux directions: allongement du canal éjaculateur chez les
                    parasites de Mammifères, allongement du cloaque chez les parasites d'Oiseaux.

                <p>Previous investigations showing that sandfly vectors of leishmaniasis in Kenya
                    feed on a wide range of plant species prompted us to investigate the

                    Flagellate-free shoots of B. Pilosa were cut and submerged 4 cm deepin nutrient

                    25°C. Then free-hand transverse sections made from the cut end of the shoot were
                    examined under a microscope. Active motile promastigotes, spread from the
                    epidermis to the pith, were observed in allthe sections up to 2 cm from the cut

                <p>The results showed that all of the echinostome cercariae examined have a long
                    cylindrical tail which ended with a slender finger-like tip. The tail surface
                    bears seven independent fin folds arranged in three pairs: proximal
                    dorso-ventral, distal dorso-ventral and ven- tro-lateral pair. À single small
                    papilla-like fold is found on the ventral surface of the tail. This fold was
                    illustrated in our previously published papers but at that time was incorrectly
                    considered to be a prolonged portion of the ventral fold of the distal dorso-
                    ventral pair.</p>

                    and C.E.revolutum sensu Johnson (1920) do not have fin folds and belong to the
                    genus Echinoparyphium.</p>
                <p>It is suggested that the genus Echinostoma has a common fin fold formula and
                    cercariae in this genus can not be distinguished by the number and arrangements
                    of their fin folds as it has previously been common practice to do. The exact
                    function of the fin folds is un- known. Most probably four of them - the large
                    membranes of the dorso-ventral proximal and distal pair are connected with the
                    swimming ability. Three of them - the small ven- tro-lateral and the
                    papilla-like folds are suggested to be sensory in function.</p>

                    nematodes, 5 of acanthocephalans). The core of the coot heminth fauna includes
                    only 35 species (24,6% of the total list), which are widely distributed and
                    usual in this host in different regions There are parasites specific for
                    Rallidae or mentioned for other water- fowis too (cestodes - 5, trematodes - 19,
                    nematodes - 4, acanthocepha- lans - I), as well as euryhostal svecies
                    (trematodes - 4, nematodes - 2) among them. All other I04 species are rare,
                    facultative or occasional parasites of the coot. Species common with ducks and
                    geese prevail in the helminth fauna of the coot (82), while the exchange by
                    parasites with grebes, plovers, gulls and other birds is more rare. Life cycles
                    of the majority of species are connected with water reservoirs (78%), water
                    mollusos and crustaceans being the main sources of invasion (21% and 32%). Wide
                    areas are typical for the coot helminths: I9 of 35 core spe- cies are
                    distributed broader then host area and IO another core species are distributed
                    all over Palearctic. Some regional peculiarities in the helminth fauna are

                    of Echinococcus are believed to exist as a complex of strains, differing in many
                    characters of epidemiological and clinical significance. Electrophoretic and DNA
                    analyses have found genetic differences between many described strains, but our
                    work has also found extensive genetic diversity within strains. This raises the
                    question of what constitutes a strain?, a question which requires us to think
                    carefully about issues such as mode of reproduction, outcrossing rate and gene
                    flow between populations.</p>
                <p>Genetic differences within and between populations, as measured by biochemical
                    and molecular techniques, need not be correlated with differences in characters
                    of epidem- iological and clinical significance, such as host preference,
                    prepatent period, infectivity and virulence. These characters are likely to be
                    polygenic in nature and therefore influenced by both genotype and environment;
                    their analysis requires a dissection of these major components of variation. We
                    need a concept of strains which recognises that genetic diversity exists within
                    populations of Echinococcus and which reconciles genetic differentiation between
                    populations with differences in characters of epidemiological and clinical
                    significance.</p>

                    5+5 unhinged marginal hooks correlate with the most primitive monogenean type of
                    spermatozoon and with few sensillae, many ciliated cells and a simple
                    protonephridial system in the oncomiracidium. This indicates that a haptor with
                    5+5 unhinged marginal hooks is more primitive than a haptor with 7+7, 8+8 or 9+9
                    marginal hooks. Hinged marginal hooks are only present in certain groups with
                    5+5 or 8+8 marginal hooks, and are most likely the result of specialization.
                    Anchors and pseudohaptors develop secondarily to marginal hooks; peripheral
                    haptoral anchors before central haptoral and peduncular anchors. Clamps, loculi
                    and squamodiscs in turn develope secondarily to anchors. On a basis of ontogeny
                    and morphological correlations | concluded a progressive monogenean evolution
                    and proposed a revised system for the Monogenea with three early evolutionary
                    lines, two for monogeneans with unhinged and one for monogeneans with 8+8 hinged
                    marginal hooks. Certain lines include monogeneans, presumably remaining on
                    marginal hook evolutionary capacity levels. More secondary lines are formed by
                    monogeneans with haptoral or peduncular anchors.The calceostomatids, with

                <p>Echinoparvphium recurvatum - Sympatric sibling species Echinoparyphium recurvatum
                    (von Linstow 1873) is a 45 collar-spined echinostome digenean with a freshwater
                    aquatic life cycle. The adult is an intestinal parasite of aquatic birds. It has
                    long been suspected that "Echinoparyphium recurvatum" may be a species complex
                    composed of a number of morphologically very similar, yet biologically discrete,
                    sibling species. This paper presents evidence for the existence of two sibling
                    species in this complex, co-existing at the same aquatic habitat in England.
                    Epidermiological field data, and experimental infection studies using
                    lab-cultured isolates, have shown that one of these sibling species utilizes the
                    lymnaeid pulmonate gastropod Lymnaea peregra as first intermediate host. The
                    other utilizes the mesogastropod prosobranch Valvata piscinalis in this
                    capacity. Additional experimental infection studies have demonstrated that the
                    adults of the two entities exhibit a marked degree of, possibly co-evolved,
                    microhabitat segregation in the intestine of an experimental definitive host,
                    Anas platyrhynchos The co- existence of the two sibling species in sympatry may
                    be explained by the fact that the life cycles of the two forms represent two
                    distinct cycles of transmission serving to eliminate excessive inter-specific
                    competition.</p>

                    parasitica - Copepoda Le concept du retard de l’évolution des parasites envers
                    leurs hôtes est depuis longtemps connu. En 1970 j’ai formulé la conception de
                    l'accélération de l’évolution des certains parasites, par éxample des Euglenida
                    - parasites des Copepoda. Le nombre de leur espèces deja connus (140) est trois
                    fois plus grand que le nombre de leurs hôtes (Copepoda). L'accélération de
                    l’évolution des eugleniens parasitaires montre la necessitée d’etablir pour eux

                    l'accélération aux parasites d’une espèce d’hôte seulement. Par exemple
                    l’Eucyclops serrulatus (Fischer) peut étre hôte des 23 espèces du genre
                    Naupliicola Mich. (entre 46 connus) et des 8 (entre 37 espèces parasitiques) du
                    genre Dinema Perty.</p>
                <p>Nous savons, que certains espèces des Euglenida penetrent dans les oeufes d’hôte,
                    se reproduisent vite et les detruisent, les autres tuent les stages divers des
                    hôtes (nauplius, metanauplius I-V, copepodit) ou - enfin - seulement les
                    individus mûrs, apres leur reproduction, en realisant ainsi le principe general
                    du parasitisme de la conserva- tion d'hôte, en ce cas pas à l’echelle
                    individuelle, mais de toute la population hos- tale. De cette façon la
                    coexistance et la coevolution des hôtes et des parasites est assurée. Quand chez
                    une espèce d’hôte les divers espèces des parasites appartenantes a un genre
                    réalisent en somme toutes ces possibilitées, nous pouvons nommer ce phénoméne:
                    “accélération physiologique parasitaire". Par example chez E. serrulatus
                    Naupliicola ocelli Mich. (et 5 autres espèces) detruit les nauplii, N.
                    helveticus Mich. (et 6 autres) - les copepodits, NW. bursaeformis Mich. - les
                    adultes. Nous trouvons aussi chez le même Æ. serrulatus et les espèces
                    parasitaires du genre Dinema, tout ces cas en ter- minant par D. metabolicum

                    redescribed from new material from the Australian lungfish, Neoceratodus
                    forsteri (Dipnoi) from à natural population in Queensland, Australia. Studies on
                    this parasite have revealed several unique anatomical features which were
                    overlooked in the original description. These singular features have required
                    that a new genus and new subfamily be proposed to contain this polystome from a
                    dipnoan. The new polystome genus differs from all other polystome genera in each
                    of the following characters: haptoral suckers bilaterally symmetric rather than
                    radially symmetric, with elaborate skeleton of sclerites rather than no
                    sclerites; hamuli - a single pair between marginal hooklets I and II rather than
                    between II and III; pocket posteriorly on each caecum opening dorsally to
                    exterior; sperm-filled sac between pockets; testes numerous, discrete,
                    cylindrical; seminal vesicle large, discrete, muscular; penis elongate,
                    muscular, unarmed, extensile; penis bulb large, muscular, with intrinsic glands;
                    host - a dipnoan. Confirmation of a polystome from a natural population of
                    Australian lungfish has interesting evolutionary implications for both parasite
                    and host.</p>

                    architectonics, phylogeny, adaptation Trematodes of Didymozoata suborder have
                    indubitable evolutional relati- onshins with Hemiurata suborder. Didymozoata
                    architectonics, especially of Nematobothriinae subfamily in a whole keeps signs
                    of similarity with halïpegine hemiurate trunk. Despite the existence of
                    phylogenetic rela- tionships between didymozoates and hemiurates, at present
                    they should be considered as independent suborders. Further evolution of
                    didymozoates relates to the transition from luminal parasitism in intestinal
                    tract of fish to tissue one. This transition caused a raw of adaptive changes
                    connected with simplification of habitation media. In the result of it there
                    apreared the whole or partial reduction of somatic musculature, ventral sucker,
                    farynx, intestinal trunk. Reproductive system obtaining high level of
                    integration is more developed. Significant change in a structure of the most
                    specialised didymozoates is a division of a body into two functionally different
                    branches. Position of internal organs is changing that is, of corse, connected
                    with changing of tonographic coordinating relationships. Directions of
                    evolutional changes of didymo- zoates organs allow to recognize that their
                    evolution is by telemornho- se tyre, i.e. specialization of caused transition
                    from more general habitation media to more narrow.</p>

                    parasitic Platyhelminthes was studied with the aim of establishing a
                    phylogenetic system of the Platyhelminthes. All Noedermata have flame bulbs
                    composed of two cells. Among the Neodermata, the Aspidogastrea, Digenea and
                    Monogenea have a septate junction in the flame bulb and capillaries, which is
                    absent in the Gyrocotylidea, Amphilinidea and Cestoidea. At least some
                    Macrostomida and Proseriata have flame bulbs similar to those of the Trematoda
                    and Monogenea, whereas all “"Dalyelloida", Temnocephalida, Typhloplanoida and
                    Kalyptorhynchia have flame bulbs formed by a single cell, with a weir consisting
                    of a single layer of longitudinal rods.</p>
                <p>This indicates that the sister group of the Neodermata is not to be found among
                    the free-living Rhabdocoela but among more "primitive" turbellarians. Lack of a
                    septate junction in the cestodes is probably due to secondary loss.</p>

                    parasi- tic Nematoda.Using morphological and morphology-functional analysis the-
                    re are distinguished the significant differential features: presence or absence
                    of the spicule,deposition of the spicule relative to the pseu- docloacal
                    canal,functional peculiarities of spicule and connected with it
                    canal,characteristics of the sclerotisation of the spicular sheath (spinose or
                    aspinose).These features allow to subdivide clearly the Ca- pillariidae into the
                    groups which are given the range of subfamilies.</p>
                <p>New subfamilies have the following differential characteristics. 1.Capi-
                    llariinae Raïlliet,1915 - the spicule is present and deposited in the spicular
                    canal outside the pseudocloacal canal.The spicular sheath is spinose.
                    2.Baruscapillariinae Lomakhin et Romashov,1987 = the spicule is present and
                    deposited inside the pseudocloacal canal.The spicular sheath is smooth,aspinose.
                    3.Skrjabinocapillariinae Lomakhin et Roma- shov,1987 - the spicule is absent,the
                    spicular sheath is smooth,aspino- se.Subfamily Capillariinae is suggested by
                    Railliet (1915) wich united within the limits of this subfamily all
                    capillariids,Capillariidae in modern sense.Priority of the name Capillariinae
                    (proposal of Railliet) is supported with our modification of the diagnosis and
                    composition of taxon.The system of Moravetz (1982) is used as the basic of

                    335000 Sevastopol, Nakhimov,2 Adaptation degree of some Rhizocephala In order to
                    receive the quantitative estimation of adaptation degree of Rhizocephala to
                    living conditions in the medium of the first order (in host) we studied the
                    structure of root-like branches of two their representatives: Briarosaccus
                    callosus and Peltogaster paguri related to the family Peltogastridae.</p>
                <p>The methods of segmentation of root-like branches of these Rhizocepha- la were
                    worked out by the author (Tkachuck,1987). The quantitative de- finition of
                    morphological parameters (S-the total area of moistened surface of parasites
                    body,W-its summary,volume, S,- specigic surface, S -reduced surface) was carried
                    out in connection with known formulas 0? stereometrye.</p>
                <p>It was established, that the structure of root-like branches of both species has
                    similar texture. However, B.callosus has more dense, bra- nched complex
                    quantitatively morphological parameters of some orders higher than those of
                    P.pagyri. B.callosus has wet surface of 529,8 sm” ,summary volume 11,3 sm and
                    P.paguri - 6,25 and g,01 correspondin- gly. The specific surface of B.callosus
                    is 4688,2 m , reduced sur- face - 10,27 and of P.paguri 2800,3 and 3,69
                    correspondingly.</p>
                <p>The size of relative surface of root-head crustacea, principdlly, is determined
                    with strong development of the surface of absorbing system, which for B.callosus
                    is 96 of total wet surface and for P.paguri is 65%.It testifies very deep
                    adaptation of parasites to living condition.</p>

                <p>Les spermatozoïdes ont été observés en microscopie photonique chez le mâle de 25
                    espèces de Nématodes Rhigonematida, appartenant aux genres Glomerinema, Obainia,
                    Xustrostoma, Rhigonema, Ichthyocephalus, Heth, Ransomnema et Carnoya. La
                    morphologie du spermatozoïde est homogène (allongée avec une extrémité plus
                    large) chez les Rhigonematoidea (Rhigonematidae et Ichthyocephalidae); des
                    morphologies différentes, homogènes à l'intérieur de chaque famille, sont
                    rencontrées chez les familles Hethidae, Ransomnematidae et Carnoyidae. Chez les
                    Rhigonematidae, les espèces peuvent souvent être différenciées sur les
                    caractéristiques suivantes: dimensions du spermatozoïde, morphologie et position
                    des éléments nucléaires. La morphologie du spermatozoïde est donc un outil
                    taxonomique utile dans cette famille. L'ultrastructure du spermatozoïde a été
                    étudiée chez le mâle dans l'espèce Rhigonema madecassum. Le spermatozoïde est
                    dépourvu d'acrosome, d'appareil flagellaire et d'enveloppe nucléaire, comme chez
                    tous les Nématodes. Il contient des éléments cytoplasmiques denses et allongés,
                    des vésicules membranaires et des amas de filaments. Les mitochondries et les
                    microtubules sont absents. Au vu de l'ultrastructure, aucune ressemblance claire
                    ne peut être trouvée entre le spermatozoïde de ce Rhigonematida et ceux qui ont
                    été décrits chez les Oxyurida et les Ascaridida.</p>

                <p>This is an effort to identify the animal and plant hosts which have intermediated
                    the recent outbreak of distomatosis in Iran. In contrast to the majority of the
                    international reports which introduce the uncooked watercress(Nasturtium
                    officinale) and/or contaminated fresh water as the main sources of infection in
                    man; it was found that people living in or visiting south-western Caspian sea
                    area have been parasitized by a local seasoning vegetable called Dalar. This
                    fresh seasoning is mainly composed of an uncooked local mint(a member of
                    Labiatae) which is widely used as salt. Encysted metacercaria was isolated from
                    the fresh leaves of this plant in the brooks of the area.</p>
                <p>Furthermore, another controversy was also raised about the genus of responsible
                    snail as primary host. In 1969 Lymnaea gedrosiana has been reported as the main
                    source of cercaria of F.hepatica in southern Caspian sea; where as infected
                    L.truncatula was repeatedly found in recent epidemiological studies.</p>

                    Brachylaimidae are characterized by the branching structure of their
                    cercariogenous spo- rocysts. In order to answer the question of theorigin of
                    branching sporocysts in brachy- laimid members, a total of 32 individuals of the
                    oioxenous first intermediate snail spe- cies Rumina decollata (Linnaeus, 1758)
                    (Gastropoda: Subulinidae) were experimentally infec- ted with an undetermined
                    number of eggs coming from experimental 170 +4 day old adults of a laboratory
                    maintained strain of Brachylaima ruminae Mas-Coma et Montoliu, 1986 (Bra-
                    chylaiminae) coming from Formentera island. After 48 hr exposure, snails were
                    maintained under controlled constant conditions of 17 +190 C, 80% r.H. and 12/12
                    hr ligth/darkness in a climatic chamber. Molluscs were fixed in groups of three
                    individuals at the intervals of 7,14,21,28,35,42,52,60,70 and 90 days
                    postinfection (dpi). The last two remaining snails were dissected for sporocyst
                    extraction in days 121 and 126, after detection of cercariae shedding. Earliest
                    sporocystic stages were seen for first time at 14 dpi, appearing as small cell
                    aggregates which develop inside the two types of cells of hepatopancreatic aci-
                    ni. At 28 dpi, aggregates slowly increase in cell number and begin to invade the
                    intera- cinar conective tissue of the digestive gland, all sporocysts being
                    already extracinar at 35 dpi. These external membrane - disposing cell
                    aggregates appear as a few acini - sur- rounding sporocyst groups or foci
                    scattered throughout the hepatopancreas. Subsequently, organisms increase in
                    number and size, their cells losing compact arrangement. At 52 dpi, first small
                    body cavities appear and sporocyst wall begin to develop. At 60 dpi, sporo-
                    cysts show large open spaces and evident branching, being already
                    cercariogenous. Early germinal balls up to stage III of development can be seen
                    inside. At 70 and 90 dpi, ad- vanced cercarial embryos are found.</p>

                <p>The parasites of salmonid fishes have become of major economic importance with
                    the advent of intensive aquaculture. Studying the parasites in a population of
                    fresh-water trout (Salmo trutta L.) and charr (Salvelinus alpinus (L.)) in
                    Vengsvatn, Fusa, Hordaland, in south-west Norway, a new blood parasite,
                    provisonally identified as a Haemohormidium, was discovered in trout; the
                    prevalence was 47 %. The merozoite, trophozoite and schizont stages were seen.
                    The Haemohormidiidae is one of three families of the class Piroplasmida, the
                    other two being Babesiidae and Theileriidae.</p>
                <p>Occurring only in the blood of fish, amphibia and reptiles, and thought to be
                    quite rare, this group has elicited little interest; contrasting with the
                    research effort accorded its piroplasmid relatives which are important in human
                    and veterinary medicine. Recently, however, more species of Haemohormidiidae
                    have been recorded from new wild fish species. The species found by us in fresh-
                    water wild trout we believe to represent a potential threat to salmonids both in
                    the wild and in aquaculture. Leeches are suspected of being the vector.</p>

                    commercially-important fishes. Recent studies on the life cycle indicate that
                    there are at least two different ''species'' or strains which have different
                    abilities to infect various crustacean hosts. Other studies using isoelectric

                    within the pH gradient of 3.5 to 9.5. Our working hypothesis is that one of
                    these species matures in the grey seal, Halichoerus grypus, and the other
                    matures in the harbour seal, Phoca vitulina.</p>

                    - life cycle With the help of parasitic analysis of fishes and invertebrates in
                    Aza- bachje Lake, the ways of circulation of Cystidicola farionis were inve-
                    stigated. It was found that amphipods Pontoporeia affinis serve as first
                    intermediate hosts of Nematodes, infestation of them by nematode larvae is 1,4%.
                    Numerous and heavily infected sockeye fry (95%) is main second intermediate host
                    of C.farionis. In these fishes mature nemato- des were found rarely (0,7%),
                    usually they contain inmature or juveni- le parasites. Mature nemnatodes
                    together with inmature ones occur in co- ho fry (13,5%), Dolly Varden (73%) and
                    pond smelt (65%), who eat amphi- pods. These fishes are eaten up by predators,
                    who are infected by C.fa- rionis - white char (76%), East Siberian char (97%)
                    and Kamchatka steelhead (63%). Parasites are mature and inmature in predators.
                    Matu- -re C.farionis predominate over immature in Kamchatka steelhead and East
                    Siberian char (65,4% and 65,8% correspondingly). lhe source of amphipods
                    invasion is all mentioned fish species, but first of all - Dolly Varden and
                    white char. The number of these fish species in the lake is considerably higher
                    than that of Kamchatka steelhead and East Siberian char, that is why they act as
                    main definitive hosts of C.fa- rionis. lhus, the main flow of invasion from
                    fishes to amphipods is made by Dolly Varden and white char. Other fish species -
                    pond smelt, East Siberian char kundscha and Kamchatka steelhead as a source of
                    infestation of amphipods by nematodes is also very important.</p>

                    tapeworm isolated during dissection of natu- rally infected wild duck Anas
                    platyrhyÿynchos created an initial material for controlled infections of
                    Hyalella azteca /Amphipoda/ from Canada and Heterocypris incongruens /Ostracoda/
                    from Poland /about 5 larvae per one crustacean/. The larvae developed in
                    f.incongruens only.Cysticercoids ob- tained of the Ostracoda were then given
                    orally to four, six-day old duck- lings at doses of 60-100 larvae per bird. The
                    result was positive in two birds. The prepatent period was 14 days, and during
                    dissection more than 40 strobilae were found. Oncospheres obtained from the
                    experimental final hosts were then able to infect Heterocypris incongruens.</p>
                <p>It is noteworthy that earlier attempts, in which oncospheres of Diorchis
                    parvogenitalis from Aythyinae were used for infection of domestic duck
                    /Anatinae/ gave negative results. It is possible that close relationship between
                    natural and experimental final host species /both of Anatinae/ used in the
                    present studies was decisive for positive course of the infe- etion. Also, it
                    suggests that a transmission of Diorchis parvogenitalis from wild birds to
                    domestic duck /via Ostracoda/ in natural environment is likely.</p>

                    from eel farms situated in the Center and South of Portugal.The prevalence of
                    infected eels (at least from one specie of parasite) was 39.2% and in cultured
                    eels it was 82.98.</p>

                    miracidia approach to the snail host by increasing their rate of change of
                    direction with increasing concentrations of che- mical host signals and by
                    returning in decreasing concentrations. This behavior was studied in two-armed
                    choice chambers, using stained snail conditioned water (SCW). At contact with
                    the host an aëtachment behavior is stimulated, which was studied using SCW in
                    agar and quantifying the responses "contact with return", especially "repeated
                    investigation" (MacInnis). Both hostfinding phases, approach and attachment are
                    stimula- ted by hydrophilic components of SCW with molecular weights of more
                    than 30,000 which can be removed by precipitation of polyanionic mucus compo-
                    nents, and are not sensitive to proteases. The stimuli are resistant to various
                    glycosidase digestions, but the signal for an approach to the host is eliminated
                    by endoglycosidase F digestion and the signal for attachment is diminished by
                    hyaluronidase.</p>

                    Tsushima Island, Nagasaki Pref., Japan. The present author also found worms free
                    in the small intestine as shown above, however, îïin addition to these free
                    worms, I found many larvae, young adults and some fully matured adults of this
                    species inside fine tubules passing in the submucosa of the innerwall of small
                    intestine. Some of these worms seemed to be confined in the tubules as if they
                    were encapsulated. By successive saggital sections of these area, these tubules
                    were demonstrated as the openings of pancreatic ducts into the small intestine
                    close to a point where the bile duct also opened.</p>

                    eggs recovered was 794, thus mean number of egg laying was approximately 100 per
                    day in these 8 days. On the ninth day, however, it increased significantly to
                    225, 49 (11th), 239 (12th) and the host fish suddenly died on the following day.
                    On the post morterm examination of the host, 6 adult worms were recovered from
                    the gills. Mean number of egg laying of an adult worm of D. nipponteum vas
                    reported as 6 to 25 per day (Ichihara et al., 1983). The mean number of egg
                    laying till 8th day of the present study seemed to be reasonable to compair with
                    that of Ichihara et al. It is, however, a very interesting phenomenon that the
                    number of egg laying suddenly increased 5 days ahead of the host's death, as if
                    the worms knew it. This problem remains in the future.</p>

                    Cystophorous cercariae - Hemiurus - Lecithochirium - Lecithocladium Among the
                    marine fish digenean life-cycles those of the hemiuroids are the lesser known.
                    This is because cystophorous cercariae are too little developed to be identified
                    without experimental infections, and because of difficulties in keeping infected
                    copepods under laboratory conditions.</p>
                <p>During the last few years, undescribed or previously little known cysto- phorous
                    cercariae have been found in molluscs in Danish waters. Experi- mental studies
                    show that the cercaria of Hemiurus luehei develops in the opisthobranch Philine
                    denticulata. A very similar cercaria, which deve- lops in Philine aperta, is
                    suggested to develop into Lecithocladium excisum. À large cercaria, which
                    develops in the prosobranch Lunatia pallida, is believed to be the cercaria of
                    Hemiurus levinseni. All these cercariae are motile and the metacercariae develop
                    in calanoid copepods, and the final hosts, fish, acquire the infection by
                    ingesting the cope- pods. The cercaria of the eel parasite Lecithochirium
                    rufoviride deve- lops in the prosobranch Gibbula cineraria. The cercaria (=
                    Cercaria vaul- legeardi) differs slightly from those of L. furcolabiatum and L.
                    fusi- forme developing in other species of Gibbula. Lecithochirium rufoviride
                    has a four-host life-cycle when harpacticoid copepods act as second in-
                    termediate host, and small teleosts as third host, but has a more con- ventional
                    three-host life-cycle when malacostraceans, such as Idothea spp. act as second
                    intermediate host. DE S 3.D 19 P.+O HOST SPECIFICITY IN SOUTH AFRICAN ANURAN

                <p>Polystoma; host specificity; anuran tadpoles Infection and development of
                    Polystoma australis larvae in natural and substitute host species were
                    investigated. Potential tadpole hosts, parasite free and of known age, were
                    subjected to oncomiracidial infection. Success of infection was similar in the
                    natural hosts Kassina senegalensis and Semnodactylus wealii. Oncomiracidia
                    preferred K. senegalensis to the substitute host Natalobatrachus bonebergi when
                    given a choice but infection was similar when no choice was given. Other species
                    were infected with varying success. Success of infection in N. bonebergi did not
                    change with tadpole age.</p>
                <p>Loss of neotenic P. australis from the gills of N. bonebergi tadpoles was greater
                    than normal and the less than 10% which reached neotenic maturity, produced few
                    or no eggs.</p>
                <p>Bladder parasites in post-metamorphic N. bonebergi showed normal development up
                    to 28 days after metamorphosis. Although P. australis can become established in
                    several host species as neotenic, bladder-destined and young bladder parasites,
                    the performance of parasites in substitute hosts compares poorly with that of P.
                    australis in its natural host K. senegalensis or P. umthakathi in its natural

                <p>Polystoma umthakathi; development; Natalobatrachus tadpole The relationship
                    between the developmental destiny (neotenic in gills or complete in bladder) of
                    polystome larvae and the age of the tadpole host at establishment, were
                    examined. Laboratory-reared Natalobatrachus bonebergi tadpoles at various stages
                    of development, were infected with Polystoma umthakathi oncomiracidia. Body size
                    and the development of suckers, hamuli and reproductive system served as
                    evidence of either neotenic or bladder-destined development. In tadpoles
                    infected before the age of 45 days (about Stage 30) development was exclusively
                    neotenic. In older tadpoles there was a gradual increase in the prevalence of
                    bladder-destined parasites, typically showing retarded growth and enlarged
                    hamuli. Development towards neotenic maturity still occurred even in tadpoles
                    infected only 16 days before metamorphosis (about Stage 34). Neotenic and
                    bladder-destined parasites often developed together in the same tadpole. There
                    was also a high prevalence of indeterminate development, parasites showing
                    various combina- tions of the characters of both neotenic and bladder-destined
                    parasites. Although para- sites established during the later stages of tadpole
                    development become mainly bladder- destined, it is evident that individual
                    parasites react differently to the stimuli associated with pre-metamorphic
                    changes in the host.</p>

                    Larus ridibundus L, inhabiting the area of Belgrade, were aimed at determining
                    the species of trematodes infecting the observed qulls, the extensity and
                    intensity of the infec- tions caused by the detected trematodes, as well as the

                <p>The determination of the collected trematodes was done by a microscope, i.e. by
                    the examination of native or lasting preparations. Out of the total of 100
                    examined gulls 82,0% were infected by trematodes. The fol- lowing eight species
                    of trematodes were ascertained: Diplostomum spathaceum, Psilostomum brevicolle,

                    AQUACULTURE A mass awareness has been created in recent years for producing more
                    fish from man-made impoundments,. Studies on seasonal dynamics of infestations
                    of parasites in some experimental ponds have proved to be statistically
                    significant through the proportion defective and analysis of variance tests in
                    relation to the nature of variance between host species, months and localities
                    in view of fish health moni- toring. From a sample size of 6150 fry and
                    fingerlings the percentages of infestations ranged from 1.5-73.3; 7.1-90.5;
                    50.0-74.3 and 2.5-62.9 in respect of trichodinid, myxobolid, gyrodactylid and
                    dactylogyrid parasites respectively. The degree of infestation (30%) together
                    with numerical abundance of argulid on its hosts (540 nos.) has been
                    highlighted. The result of simple correlation co-efficient (r) between the rates
                    of infestation (14 to 71%) and some environmental factors responsible for the
                    outbreak of the disease have been taken into consideration while suggesting
                    control methods to combat the parasitic invasion and discarding the
                    indiscriminate use of insecticides/pesticides, generally applied by common
                    fishermen during pisciculture. Among the environmental parameters temperature,
                    oxygen, carbon dioxide, pH have definite roles to play and their correlations
                    have been proved significant statistically. More than fifteen hundred articles
                    have been consulted to prepare concise account of the history of Trichodina spp,
                    Myxobolus spp, Gyrodactylus spp, Dactylogyrus spp, Argulus spp, etc. - their
                    ecology and zoo-geography, biology, pathogenecity and control measures. It is
                    deemed that comprehensive account of the aforesaid parasites will be of

                    snakes. Total 26 human cases were found between 1982 and 1989 by the recovery of
                    adult worms after treatment with praziquantel. The life cycle studies in the
                    laboratory and in the field showed that the fresh water snails, Hippeutis
                    cantori, serve as the first intermediate host and the tadpoles and frogs of Rana
                    nigromaculata take the role of the second inter- mediate host harbouring the
                    metacercariae. The snake, Rhabdophis tigrinus, also harbours the metacercariae,
                    and is regarded a paratenic or transport host for human infection. The
                    laboratory rats or mice were proven to be highly susceptible for the infection
                    as à definitive host. Some of the human cases experienced abdominal pain or
                    discomfort accompanied by intermittent diarrhea. In experimental rats or mice,
                    most of the flukes were found parasitizing in the duodenum, embracing the top
                    portion of the villi, and histopathologically the duodenal mucosa showed severe
                    destructions nearby the worms and revealed characteristic features of villous

                <p>Copepods of the family Nicothoidae (-Choniostomatidae) parasitize a variety of
                    crustaceans, including ostracods, isopods, amphipods, cumaceans, mysidaceans,
                    decapods, leptostracans and tanaidaceans. Commonly referred to as
                    "“egg-mimics'", these parasites have been reported from the marsupia of
                    Crustacea inhabiting marine waters on both sides of the North Atlantic Ocean, as
                    well as in the southern hemisphere. Members of the nicothoid genus Sphaeronella
                    have been reported from ostracods, cumaceans, and, primarily, amphipods.
                    Sphaeronella sp. was found on the motile, epibenthic amphipod, Orchomenella
                    pinguis (Lysianassidae) from two sites on the Scotian Shelf at prevalences of 21
                    and 47% in February, 1989. Abundances were 0.26 and 0.58 copepod per host at the
                    two sites, and range of infection was 1 - 4 copepods per amphipod. All parasitic
                    stages were immature preadult forms, and a single copepodite was associated with
                    one amphipod host. Infection levels at one of the sites were drastically higher
                    in May, 1989, with a prevalence of 63%, an abundance of 2.2 and a range of 1 -
                    23 copepods per host. There was no evidence of host castration, as 79% of the
                    amphipods bearing broods were parasitized. Only 0.3% of the parasites had
                    developed to mature females in May, and none bore ovisacs. It is proposed that
                    Sphaeronella sp. parsitizing ©. pinguis overwinters both as 1) an immature form
                    in the marsupium of the amphipod, and 2) a free-living copepodite. This is the
                    first report of a nicothoid copepod from O0. pinguis, and only the second from a
                    lysianassid amphipod.</p>

                <p>The great majority of myxosporeans form cysts, in which numerous spores develop,
                    in a given location. The spores of another group of myxosporeans develop in
                    small plasmodia situated coelozoically in the lumen of the urinary passages and
                    biliary ducts. In this latter type of development the coelozoic stage is always
                    preceded by a presporogonic stage. According to the type of this presporogonic
                    stage, a Hoferellus-type and a Sphaerospora-type development can be
                    distinguished.</p>
                <p>In the case of Hoferellus-type development, the presporogonic stages of
                    Hoferellus and Myxobilatus species develop in the epithelial cells of the
                    urinary passages, while the trophozoites of Myxidium lieberkühni and M. rhodei
                    are formed in the glomeruli.</p>
                <p>Hoferellus-type development is characterized by an annual seasonäl cycle.</p>
                <p>During Sphaerospora-type development the coelozoic sporogonic renal stage is
                    preceded by a presporogonic stage in the blood. In the case of S. renicola of
                    the common carp, there is an intermediate swimbladder stage. The development of
                    the PKX organism of salmonids represents a unique form of Sphaerospora-type
                    development. The PKX parasite is presumably an early developmental stage of a
                    Sphaerospora sp. which multiplies in the renal interstitium. Multiplication is
                    by internal cleavage in both Hoferellus and Sphaerospora-type development and
                    the primordia of sporoblasts appear already at the presporogonic stage.</p>

                    Aquatic life cycles - Digenetic Trematodes Brackish water lagoons of the Ebro
                    Delta (NE Iberian Peninsula) have been prospected to study parasitologically the
                    Invertebrate fauna as intermediate hosts of Digenetic Tre- matodes. The analysis
                    of 326 Hydrobia acuta (Drap., 1805) (Æ.a.), 1474 Mercurta confusa (Fraunf.,
                    1863) (M.c.) (Molusca, Prosobranchia, Hydrobiidae) and several Crustaceans
                    Gamma- rus aequicauda (Mart., 1931) (G.a.) (Amphipoda) and Sphaeroma hookert
                    Leach (Lej., 1966) (S.h.) (Isopoda) have provided the finding of larval forms
                    closely related to Trematodes species parasites of small mammals (Insectivora
                    and Rodentia).</p>

                    chaetotaxic pat- tern (observed through argentic impregnation) typical of the
                    family have been observed: Maritrema sp. in H.a. (7,36%) and M.c. (1,36%),
                    Microphallidae gen. sp. in A.a. (0,31%) and Levinsentella sp. in H.a. (2,11%)
                    and M.ce. (4,81%), the last ones encysting themselves within the sporocyst
                    evolving into progenetic metacercariae. Microphallid encysted meta- cercariae
                    belonging to the genus Marttrema parasitized the crustaceans G.a. and S.h. Me-
                    tacercariae of Maritrema sp. have been obtained experimentally in these

                <p>Aquatic Hydrobiids seem to be, in Ebro Delta, the most important invertebrates
                    acting as intermediate hosts of diverse Digenea species, this fact being
                    favoured by the high poblational density of these Gastropods caused principally
                    by their eurihaline character.</p>

                    specific characters To analyse the discriminatory power of specific characters
                    of two Di- lostomum metacercariae, the host-induced variability of D. paracaudum
                    and D. pseudospathaceum was studied. Four fish groups /two F Cyprinus carpio and
                    two of Poecilia reticulata/ were infected with D. aracaudum cércariae
                    originating from Radix ovata and Calba palustris, and four with cercariae of
                    D.pseudospathaceum from Lymnaea stagnalis and G. pa- lustris.195 and 157
                    metacercarial Specimens were measured,respectively; 15 characters and 8 indices
                    describing different structures were exami- ned.These morphometric data of
                    experimental groups were examined stä- tistically using non-orthogonal two-way
                    ANOVA to determine host-induced variability. Metacercariae of both species show
                    highly significant va- riation in almost all analysed characters.Molluscan
                    origin was more significant than fish host.Co-actions of both factors also was
                    observed The demonstrated morphological variation and lack of clear differences
                    in morphometric data of the species examined raises the question of the
                    diagnostic value of the characters under study. Therefore their discriminatory
                    power was examined. Analysis of differences between the mean values of 23
                    characters showed that for 18 there were significant differences between the
                    species. But the discriminatory power of these characters was too low.The
                    coefficient of similarity of these charac- ters proved to be too high.It is
                    clear that the possibility to differ- entiate the species on the basis of
                    characters examined is very limited.</p>

                    Salmo gairdneri=Oncorhynchus mykiss from the region north-east of Mag- deburg
                    showed systemic infection with unicellular protists.The parasi- tes were
                    detected in native squash preparations as well as in stained smears and
                    histological sections.They were stained positively by the fungus-staining after
                    Swartz.Accordingly,we consider them as fungus- like organisms.The intra- and
                    intercellularly located or coelozoic parasites were observed in kidney(renal
                    interstitium,epithelium and lumen of the renal tubules),liver and gills.They
                    occurred also in ma- crophages.The organisms consist of single spherical cells
                    measuring 1.5-8 jum(mostly 2.5-5 jum)in diameter.They contain granules with a
                    dia- meter’of 0.4-0.8 um. Te single cells grow up to spherical or ovoid mo- ther
                    cells(diamefer 15-20 um)which contain up to 12 daughter cells.The protists are
                    similar to een lens described during the last 10 years from salmonids(MceVicar
                    &amp; Wootten,van de Moer et al.,Harrell et al.,Nash et al.,Hedrick et al.)and
                    cyprinids(Landsberg &amp; Paperna,Kovâcs-Gayer et al.,Kô1lbl),mostly with
                    affiliation to Dermocystidium.But all these fun- gus-like organisms do not
                    belong to Dermocystidium,because they propa- gate by internal cleavage(and not
                    by plasmodial development)and do not form cysts.Thus the new group of pathogenic
                    fish parasites is more re- semblant to Ichthyochytrium vulgare Plehn,1920 which
                    is morphologically similar and shows(Lom &amp; Dykova)a comparable mode of
                    propagation.There- fore,we prefer to designate the new protists as
                    Ichthyochytrium-like.</p>

                <p>Acanthocephalus dirus - Lirceus lineatus - Integumental pigmentation To further
                    study life history transmission strategies of acanthocephalans that use
                    freshwater isopods as intermediate hosts, Lirceus lineatus were collected from
                    epigean habitats in western Kentucky streams during the fall, winter and spring
                    months of 1985 through 1990. Prevalence of infection with Acanthocephalus dirus
                    was usually more than 10% (mean 18.3%), but reachéd levels as high as 25.8%.
                    Over 90% of infected isopods were either more lightly or more darkly pigmented
                    than uninfected isopods. Integumental pigmentation of lightly-pigmented isopods
                    (previously reported) consisted of decreased numbers of pigment cells, whereas
                    integumental pigmentation of darkly-pigmented isopods was the result of
                    increased numbers of pigment granules. Integumental pigments, extracted with
                    methanolic:HCI (19:13, exhibited absorption spectra similar to ommochrome
                    pigments, but not identical to those of xanthommatin described for European
                    Asellus aquaticus. A. aquaticus, infected with Acanthocephalus lucii, have also
                    been reported to be more darkly pigmented. Since ovigerous female L. lineatus
                    Cand those with embryos developing in their marsupia) have also been found to
                    have increased integumental pigmentation, it is suggested that more
                    darkly-pigmented integument may be the result of increased metabolic activity
                    due to parasitism or reproductive effort. This hypothesis is supported by our
                    knowledge that ommochrome pigments in the integument of certain insects are the
                    metabolic end-products of tryptophan metabolism.</p>

                    transmission de l'espèce dans les eaux européennes sont étudiées: la durée de
                    vie des jeunes larves du 2ème stade dans l'eau est de environ 40 jours à 12° C
                    et d'une quinzaine de jours à 18-29° C; le développement des larves jusqu'au

                    been completely worked out.®The results are briefly given as follows:The
                    developmental stages such as egg, miracidium,sporocyst,mo- ther redia,daughter
                    redia, cercaria, metacercaria,and adult worm are discribed in detail.</p>
                <p>The studies of its life history and epidemiology show that the cercæriae of E,
                    japonicus can encyst in the body of Parafossarulus striatulus and that there are
                    metacercariae of E.japonicus in the gill of tadpole or in the atrophic gill of
                    small frogs. The metacer- cariae were fed to laboratory-reared dogs ,whits rats
                    and duckling and a number of adult worms were secured from the small intestines
                    of the animals.The studies also show that the positive snails die, they spread
                    into water pices of tissues containg large number of the
                    metacercariae.Experiment have been conducted to infect dogs,white rats,and duck-
                    lings with the metacercariae taken from the water.The results show that these
                    animals are all infected with the parasites.In the light of the above facts, the
                    authors believe that if children drink water polluted by the metacercariae or
                    play with the tadpole or small frogs carrying the metacercariae, they may also
                    be infected by the parasite.The first intermediate host in Fujian,China is

                    cooperation whit an international research programme concerning the biology of
                    the long-finned pilot whale, Globicephala melas (Traill), in the Northeast
                    Atlantic, 154 whales in the Faroese drive fishery were examined for
                    ectoparasites. Four whale classes according to their sex and sexual status were
                    established for comparative purposes. Five zones on each host were identified
                    for site-selection studies.</p>
                <p>The whale-louse Isocyamus delphini (Guérin-Meneville, 1836) was detected on
                    29.61% of the hosts. This ectoparasite exibited overdispersed distribu- tions on
                    the four whale classes. Prevalence, abundance and spatial distribu tion of I.
                    delphini on sexualy mature male whales differred significantly from those of the
                    rest of host classes (inmature and mature females, -and juvenile males). The
                    highest prevalence and heaviest infections were observed on the mature male
                    class. Behavioural differences between male and female and between adult and
                    juvenile pilot whales could account for these results.</p>
                <p>It is suggested that the viability of the I. delphini population may depend upon
                    the occurrence of unhealed wounds occasionaly found on sexualy mature male
                    whales. The genital slit was by far the most preferred site by I.</p>
                <p>delphini. This location seems to be one of the few which can offer appropriate
                    shelter for whale-lice living on a streamed-lined, fast moving odontocete such
                    as the pilot whale.</p>

                <p>In the course of a research programme about factors limiting the population of
                    franciscana dolphins (Pontoporia blainvillei) in Argentinian waters (DGCYT's
                    project No. PB87-146-C2-2), a parasitological survey is in progress. Preliminary
                    results are presented here. So far, 17 franciscanas by-caught between 1988 and
                    1989 off Buenos Aires Province were examined for helminths. Necropsies included
                    examination of lungs, air sinusses, heart, Kkidneys, muscle, blubber, liver,
                    panchreas, stomach and intestine. In all, four helminth species have been
                    detected.</p>
                <p>Polymorphus cetaceum (Acanthocephala: Polymorphidae) was found attached to the
                    walls of all stomach compartments and duodenal ampulla of all hosts. This
                    species was particularly abundant in the so-called pyloric stomach. This species
                    showed the highest prevalence and intensity of infection. Anisakis sp.
                    (Nematoda: Anisakidae) ocurred in 9 of the 17 dolphins. Worms were found free in
                    the stomach compartments, showing a preference to locate in the main (fundic)
                    stomach. Two digenean species were also found. Pholeter gastrophilus
                    (Pholeteridae) appeared within cysts in the submucosa of main stomach and
                    duodenal ampulla of a single specimen. Finally, digeneans belonging to the
                    family Campulidae were detected in the intestine of all franciscanas surveyed.
                    Generally, these worms occurred in the anterior half of the intestine,
                    particularly in the first three metres.</p>
                <p>The taxonomic position of this helminths will be clarified in further
                    studies.</p>

                    HYDRIFORME (COELENTERATA ) E.V. Raikova. Institute of Cytology, USSR Academy of
                    Sciences, 4 Tikhoretsky Avenue, 194064 Leningrad, USSR Polypodium -
                    Intracellular cytokinesis - Trophamnion - Polyploidy The early stages of
                    Polypodium development are parasitic in previtellogenic oocytes of Acipenserid
                    fish. They include: (1) a binucleate cell with unequally-sized nuclei; (2)
                    isolation of cytoplasm around the small nucleus, corresponding to the
                    cytokinesis of meiosis II; (3) migration of the small cell into an invagination
                    formed by the nucleus of the large cell, and (4) a “cell-in-a-cell" stage, the
                    small generative cell occupying à cavity formed by the hollow nucleus of the
                    large trophic cell. The large cell which corresponds to the ?nd polar body later
                    transforms into the trophamnion, a unicellular envelope surrounding the
                    developing embryo and having a highly polyploid (&gt;400c) reticulate nucleus.
                    The generative cell (the egg) divides into blastomeres which form a morula. The
                    gastrulation occurs by morular delamination and it is coupled with the germ
                    layer inversion typical of the parasitic stages of Polypodium. The trophamnion
                    around the developing larva serves for digesting host oocyte yolk. Both the
                    generative cell and the blastomeres are haploid, diploidy being restored later.
                    The egg of Polypodium is the smallest known among the coelenterates; it lacks
                    yolk and develops without fertilization. Both the blastomeres and the nucleus of
                    the trophamnion actively incorporate ‘H-uridine. A hypothesis is put forward
                    supposing sex inversion in the evolution of Polypodium, the binucleate
                    pre-gametes having been initially male, which means that the development of
                    Polypodium is essentially modified androgenesis.</p>

                    Proteocephalid cestodes - non siluriform fishes The authors recently described
                    (Rego &amp; Pavanelli, in press), three new proteocephalid species from non
                    siluriform fishes in Brazil, they are two species of Proteocephalus
                    (Proteocephalinae) and one of Nomimoscolex (Zygobothriinae), besides new hosts
                    were added to the already known proteocephalid species, Choanoscolex abscissus
                    (Riggenbach, 1896) and Monticellia coryphicephala (Monticelli, 1891).</p>
                <p>The proteocephalids are usually found within siluriforms in South America and
                    other Con- tinents. Anteriorly, only three species of these parasites were cited
                    from a Cichlid, from the Amazon.</p>
                <p>These species are not common in the fishes examined and only one or two specimens
                    œuld be found in each host. Probably it is an adaptative process to other fish

                <p>.Waterfowls were bought and killed in Tonkabon Medical Research Station in the
                    Caspian Sea area. After identification of the species, nasal tissues of the
                    birds were removed, finely teased apart (Blair &amp; Ottesen, 19/9) and examined
                    for existance of worm fragments. Different snails were collected in the field
                    and examined for infection of ocellate schistosome cercariae. Laboratory bred
                    snails were exposed to miracidia for succeptibility as an intermediate host.
                    Cercariae shed by these laboratory snails were used on the arms of volunteers
                    for observation of possible dermatits. . .</p>
                <p>A total number of 28 ducks and geese were killed in the laboratory, including 16
                    Anas platyrhynchos three Anas clypeata, one Aythya ferina and one Anas

                <p>Experimental infection of laboratory reared parasite free carp was possible by
                    fecal contamination, which allowed to study the development of the parasite. At
                    20°C merogony was observed in intestinal epithelial cells up to day 8 PI with
                    meronts producing 8 to 14 merozoites. Gamogony occured during days 7 to 9 PI in
                    cells of the same location. Formation of oocysts mainly took place in cells of
                    the lamina propria and was completed at days 9 to 10 PI. Development was
                    influenced by temperature: at 8°C sporulated oocysts first were shed 37 days PI,
                    at 12°C 32 to 35 days PI, at 15°C 18 days PI, and at 30°C 7 days PI. Laboratory
                    infection of carp also was possible with tubificid oligochaetes (Tubifex tubifex
                    and Limnodrilus hoffmeisteri) as paratenic hosts. Tubificids, fed on intestinal
                    tissue containing G. carpelli oocysts, harboured free motile sporozoites in the
                    cells lining the alimentary tract, and carp fed on these tubificids aquired à G.

                    per host. Larval C. australis were found attached inside the gill chambers of
                    another cyprinid, Barbus aeneus, a plankton feeder. Parasite prevalence was 21%
                    and parasites occurred on hosts smaller than 20 cm. Up to 18 parasites were
                    found attached to a single host. Female C. australis leave their hosts after
                    copulation to deposit eggs on any hard substrate. The morphology and body
                    posture of the newly hatched larvae fascilitate attachment to the host. During
                    further development a drastic morpho- logic transformation of the maxillules
                    into suckers changes C. australis from a sessile larva to à motile juvenile
                    which establishes itself on a different host. It is concluded that differences
                    in feeding behaviour of the two host species, together with morpho- logical
                    adaptations of developing parasites, are the determining factors for the change
                    of hosts during the life cycle.</p>

                <p>Experimental studies have been realized with adult Lymnaea truncatula of three
                    popula- tions to follow the numerical variations of floating metacercariae
                    according to various ecological factors. The number of these floating cysts was
                    low: 1.4, 3.6, and 6.8 % of the produced metacercariae according to the snail
                    population. Their number was twice lower with snails set under a constant
                    temperature (16° or 20° C) than with those sub- mitted to daily temperature
                    changes (12°-25° C). The duration of the photoperiod (from 6:18 to 18:6 hours)
                    and the intensity of the artificial light (1,000-10,000 lux at the surface of
                    containers) did not affect the number of floating metacercariae: most of them
                    were formed in the middle of the night with an optimum about midnight. The
                    diame- ter of the experimental container (35 to 600 mm), the presence or absence
                    of a vegetal support, the height of the water layer (1 to 25 mm) and its change
                    (1 to 4 times per day) did not affect their production. The formation of these
                    floating metacercariae is generated by 17 to 31 % of the infected molluscs
                    (according to the population); their number is not linled to the total number of
                    parasites shed by L. truncatula. Histolo- gical control of 13 molluscs killed
                    after the formation of these floating cysts (by light microscopy) did not show
                    any visible structural difference compared to snails not shedding this type of
                    metacercariae (11 specimens). The authors raise the hypothesis of a pathology
                    during the shedding of cercariae causing these floating cysts, implying a
                    ‘'defensive" reaction of the host snail and resulting in a disturbance in the
                    external layer of the outer cyst wall.</p>

                    ITS LUNGFISH HOST I. Whittington, S. Pichelin. Dept. of Parasitology, University
                    of Queensland, Brisbane Australia 4067 Monogenea, polystome, eggs, attachment,
                    lungfish Eggs of a polystome monogenean were found attached to the surface of
                    the tooth plates of several Australian lungfish Neoceratodus forsteri (Dipnoi)
                    captured from south-east Queensland, Australia. Scanning electron microscopy
                    reveals that the crushing surface of the tooth plates of infected hosts can bear
                    an extensive, carpet-like cover comprising enormous numbers of eggs. These eggs
                    appear to be cemented firmly to the tooth plate surface by egg shell material at
                    the distal tip of the abopercular appendage. Use of the tooth plates may simply
                    reflect that they offer a suitably hard platform to which the parasite can
                    attach its eggs. Observations on living parasites and fresh eggs removed from
                    hosts indicate that the eggs are laid singly, undergo embryonation on the tooth
                    plates, and hatch in situ to release a non-ciliated oncomiracidium. Attachment
                    of eggs by this polystome to its host, a rare strategy among monogeneans,
                    achieves some of the advantages, and avoids some of the disadvantages, of
                    ovoviviparity and advanced embryo development in utero. Emergence of
                    non-ciliated oncomiracidia permits auto-infection of the host. However some
                    genetic heterogeneity might be promoted by transfer of larvae and/or adults from
                    host to host, possibly during spawning of lungfish.</p>

                    histologique réalisée à des temps différents post-infestation s'échelonnant
                    entre 10 minutes et 48 heures, les voies de pénétration et les stratégies

                    hupensis. Il est admis que dans le genre Schistosoma les miracidiums pénètrent
                    exclusivement par voie transtégumentaire. Les auteurs montrent que les
                    miracidiums des. japonicum n'utilisent pas seulement cette voie. Beaucoup
                    d'entre eux s'engagent dans les orifices naturels du Mollusque et effectuent
                    leur pénétration au niveau de l'œsophage, de l'estomac, du rectum et de la
                    cavité branchiale. La proportion de larves qui infestent le Mollusque par ces
                    voies naturelles est au moins égale à 60% dans les conditions expérimentales
                    retenues. Une étude des stratégies de colonisation des différents tissus et
                    organes du Mollusque révèle que la migration des larves vers les organes
                    viscéraux profonds (rein, cœur, sinus), qui représentent les microbiotopes
                    normaux du sporocyste primaire de S. japonicum, se fait le plus souvent par voie

                <p>L'utilisation des voies naturelles comme mode d'infestation du Mollusque

                    that shrimps such as Caridinia nilotica gracilipes,Macrobrachium superbum serve
                    as the secnnd intermediate hosts of Psilotrema fukienensis and that the

                    development observed may result from their reproduction capacity.</p>
                <p>Schizonts of various maturation degree and trophozoïites were present at all

                    The presence of infective mero- zoites in 5-8 days’ culture was confirmed by

                    characterized by the branching structure of their cercariogenous spo- rocysts.
                    This ramification has always posed the question of the existence of only one ge-
                    neration or two generations of sporocysts in brachylaimid members. A clear
                    mother sporo- cyst showing the presence of daughter sporocysts inside has never
                    been described nor de- tected until now. In order to answer this question, a
                    total of 32 individuals of theoio- xenous first intermediate snail species
                    Rumina decollata (Linnaeus, 1758) (Gastropoda: Su- bulinidae) were
                    experimentally infected with an undetermined number of eggs coming from ex-

                    island. After 48 hr ex- posure, snails were maintained under controlled constant

                    in different places of the digesti- ve gland and characterized by the presence
                    of the enormous cells, with a reticulated cyto- plasm, scattered between

                    intraperitoneal infection with protoscoleces is of- ten used. Fertile larvocysts
                    were obtained from spontaneously infected sheep and camels from Kazakhstan, pigs
                    from Byelorussia and cattle from Moldavia. 240 females of white ce ThssS I4-T6
                    g) devided into 4 equal groups were used in our test. Each mouse was injected
                    i.p. with 1000 + I00 livable protoscoleces in 0.2-0,5 ml of sterile solution of
                    Henx with antibiotics (2000 units/ml of penicilline and I mg/ml strep-
                    tomycine). The first group of mice was inoculated with protoscoleces from sheep,
                    the second - from camel the third - from pig and the fourth _- from cattle. The
                    mice were killed 6, I2 and I5 months later. 93.3% of mice from group I, 45% from
                    group 2, 28.3% from group 3 and 75% from group 4 became infected. Larvocysts
                    developed in abdominal cavity, 1li- ver, spleen,diaphragm (group I), only in
                    abdominal cavity (group 2), on liver, lungs, diaphragm and spleen (group 3) or
                    only in liver (group 2). Larvocysts were fertile IS months later in group I, 6
                    months later in group 2, I2 months later in group # and did not become fertile
                    and calcificated in group 3. Thus, physiological variants and strains of
                    E.granulosus differ from each other according to periods of development of
                    secondary larvocysts and their localization in mice.</p>

                <p>Mois clés : Ultrastructure - Hémosporidie-Schizonte hépatique.</p>
                <p>Chez les Hepatocystis, hématozoaires parasites de Chiroptères et de Sciuridés, le
                    schizonte peut atteindre des tailles considérables et deux modalités peuvent se
                    produire: la cellule- hôte demeure présente et s'hypertrophie ou bien elle
                    disparait presque totalement. L'ultrastructure de ce dernier type est étudiée
                    chez des mégaloschizontes d'Hepatocystis sp. parasite de Micropteropus pusillus
                    . En partant du centre du parasite on rencontre successivement:1) une zône de
                    nature parasitaire (une masse de colloïde, une couronne nucléocytoplasmique, un
                    réseau de digitations claires ), 2) une zône intermédiaire (la vacuole
                    parasitophore avec un matériel fibreux), une zône de structures appartenant à
                    l'hôte (un réseau de digitations denses,une forte réaction histiomacrophagique
                    avec infiltration de collagène) Il est conciu 1) que l'enveloppe du parasite
                    souvent décrite comme simple et épaisse, est composée de plusieurs éléments
                    d'origine et de nature diverses; 2) que le parasite n'est pas au contact du
                    tissu hépatique puisque la vacuole et la membrane parasitophore sont présentes.
                    Le schizonte est donc protégé par une enveloppe de l'hôte et ne serait pas
                    reconnu comme corps étranger;3) que le tissu hépatique est très remanié à
                    proximité du schizonte. Ces altérations seraient la conséquence du mode de
                    nutrition du parasite qui puise les éléments nutritifs dans les hépatocytes
                    adjacents. Leur mort entrainerait un appel de cellules phagocytaires avec
                    constitution du granulome bien avant la maturation du schizonte, le parasite
                    n'étant pas attaqué.</p>

                <p>The purpose of this study was to determine whether differences and/or
                    similarities in the mating behaviour of two Australian reptile tick species,
                    Amblyomma limbatum and Aponomma hydrosauri, lead to a reduction in the
                    reproductive fitness of colonizing females at their parapatric boundary.
                    Laboratory and field experiments were conducted to examine the effect of
                    environmental conditions, the selection of attachment sites on hosts, and delays
                    in successful conspecific mating on the reproductive fitness of females of both
                    species. Results showed that females of the two species differed in their; (1)
                    movements on hosts prior to mating, and (2) attachment sites on hosts where
                    mating occurred. Furthermore, Amb. limbatum required warmer on-host temperatures
                    than Ap. hydrosauri to induce mating, and the time when mating occurred
                    influenced the number of viable progeny produced by females of both species. It
                    is concluded that a combination of these factors influence the reproductive
                    success of female ticks and that this is important in relation to the formation
                    and maintenance of their parapatric boundaries.</p>

                    dans l'estomac. Les Athérures se reproduisant difficilement, nous avons tenté
                    d'infester d'autres animaux dont le Lapin, et le Cobaye. Les 2 Lapins infestés
                    et 12/18 Cobayes infestés et autopsiés au-delà de la période prépatente se sont
                    révélés positifs à l'autopsie mais négatifs à l'examen coprologique: Les oeufs

                    ponte chez les hôtes expérimentaux. Les larves infestantes sont engainées. Chez
                    le Lapin, l'infestation par la peau, sous-cutanée et transcutanée, est positive.

                    la 4e mue (J19). La période prépatente est de 28-31 jours.</p>
                <p>L'absence de larves dans le foie suggère que leur migration a lieu par voie

                    cincinnati, Ohio 45221-0006, USA Wardius zibethicus - Development and Hosts
                    Beginning with a single snail (Helisoma anceps) infected with the cecum worm
                    (Wardius zibethicus) of muskrats (Ondatra zibethica), the following data were
                    ascertained experimentally. Emergent cercariae encysted on glass in 2 to 25 Min.
                    Encysted meta- cercariaewere immediately infective, and remained so for up to 46
                    days (mortality of encysted worms was due to microbial action on cyst walls,
                    allowing excystment in water).</p>
                <p>Encysted metacercariae were introduced into mice, rats, hamsters and gerbils via
                    stomach tube; worms reached gravid condition in 20 days only in mice and
                    hamsters.</p>
                <p>Maximum body size (12 mm) was attained in both hosts at about day 65
                    post-infection (PI) Adults survived for up to 73 days in hamsters and 147 days
                    in mice. Eggs emitted by gravid adults were maintained in conditioned tap water
                    at ambient temperature (24-26 C).</p>
                <p>Miracidia hatched as early as day 28, and continued to hatch until day 47 of
                    incubation.</p>
                <p>Hatchability usually ranged from 10 to 80%, most eggs hatching between days 34
                    and 40.</p>
                <p>Eggs from worms older than 100 days PI showed declining rates of fertility and
                    hatch- ability. Laboratory-reared snails were exposed to 1 to 15 newly-hatched
                    miracidia over- night, but miracidia were found to survive only 1 to 6 hours
                    after hatching. Primary and secondary rediae were found in the digestive gland
                    on day 26 PI, but not cercariae.</p>
                <p>Cercarial emergence began as early as day 42 PI, but patency sometimes required
                    more than 60 days. Like the original natural infection, cercarial emergence
                    continued for about 3 months, with a daily output of 4 to 65
                    cercariae/snail/day. Based on these data, it is estimated that Wardius
                    zibethicus can comolete its entire life cycle in about three months, and
                    probably more rapidly in the higher temperatures of Summer.</p>

                <p>Isospora — Reptiles — Endogenous stages.</p>
                <p>Lacertile reptiles, geckoes, agama lizards and skinks were studied for coccidian
                    infections in Australia, Thailand, South Africa and Israel. All collected
                    Isospora by definition, e.g. with two sporocysts, each containing 4 sporozoites,
                    were with characteristic stieda body as in Isospora in avian hosts. Study of
                    endogenous stages in the intestine reveales division of these species into
                    species developing in the cytoplasm of the epithelial host cells and other
                    developing in the nucleus of their epithelial host cell. In the intranuclear
                    species both merogony and gamogony oceurs in the nucleus. Ultrastructural
                    studies reveal that the nucleus is gradually consumed with the advent of the
                    coccidian development. When the zygote and the oocyst appear, the host nucleus
                    by then is reduced into a thin envelope. The host cell cytoplasm retains its
                    integrity to the end of the developmental process. Intranuclear forms of
                    coccidia are not unique to Isospora and occur in Eimeria and Goussia species,
                    perdominantly in lower vertebrates - fish, amphibia and reptiles, very few
                    species occur in mammals and none in birds.</p>

                    SEMI-ARID ENVIRONMENT L.J.Fourie, T.N. Petney. Department of Zoology-Entomology,
                    University of the Orange Free State, Bloemfontein 9300, South Africa.</p>
                <p>Adaptations Life cycle Tick Ixodes rubicundus is a tick confined largely to the
                    semi-arid environment of the Karoid areas of South Africa. It is a major
                    agricultural problem in this area as it causes poten tially fatal paralysis in
                    domestic stock and wild ungulates. This study gives the first detailed account
                    of the life cycle of this species. Quantitative sampling of ticks from hosts and
                    free-living stages were carried out for 4 years. The distribution of free-
                    living ticks was determined in relation to microclimatic conditions and the
                    behaviour of natural and domestic hosts. Laboratory studies were carried out to
                    determine water relationships, developmental rates and various behaviour
                    patterns.</p>
                <p>The life cycle of I. rubicundus extends over 2 years. Larvae are mainly active
                    during the wet season (March-June) and nymphae during June-November. Nymphae
                    aestivate during the warm and dry summer in their engorged state. Adults occur
                    in winter (April-August) characterized by sub-zero night temperatures. Maximum
                    ecological longevity of this stage is 5 months.</p>
                <p>Hosts of immatures are territorial elephant shrews. Territorial species are also
                    the natural hosts of adults. Adults occur in close proximity to shrub and tree
                    species characterized by dense undergrowth and foliage and are found mainly on
                    the cooler south- ern sides of plants. The critical equilibrium activity of
                    adults is similar to that of other members of the genus which do not occur in
                    arid conditions but transpiration rates are lower.</p>
                <p>The microclimate in the undergrowth is cooler and moister than in surrounding
                    areas and hosts of the tick use this vegetation as forage and resting sites. The
                    microhabitat used by I. rubicundus is therefore less stresful than other
                    microhabitats and provides a maximum chance of contact with hosts.</p>

                    ANCYLOSTOMA CANINUM M.Granzer. Institut für Zoologie 1, Universität

                    caninum, infective larva, host-finding The host signals which stimulate the
                    host-finding steps of the infective larvae of Ancylostoma caninum were analyzed.
                    Snake-like movements of the larvae are stimulated by an increase of the
                    surrounding temperature and by defined vibrations, but these stimuli do not
                    provoke any directed move- ment. Waving behavior where the larvae move their
                    anterior body part hori- zontally in erect posture is triggered by the approach
                    of a heated object or by an air-stream containing the effective factors heat
                    and/or CO,. The larvae cannot pass over to a host actively, but waving larvae
                    cling to the host”s surface when being touched. When adhering to the host the
                    larvae should migrate from the fur to the skin surface. This might be achieved
                    by their creeping to the warmer direction in thermal gradients as low as
                    0.04°C/mm. Directed creeping is also stimulated by a hydrophilic component of
                    dog skin surface extract integrated into membrane filters. Penetrations of the
                    larvae into agar are stimulated by hydrophilic extracts of dog skin surface and
                    dog serum. Warmth (mean 38°C) alone also acts as a penetration stimulus into
                    agar. The effective chemical components of both, serum and skin extract have a
                    molecular weight of approximately 10,000. They have protein character as they
                    are sensitive to proteinase digestion but not to treatments affecting
                    carbohydrate components. The host-finding of infec- tive A.caninum larvae can
                    now be considered as a sequence of behavioral patterns which are stimulated by
                    host signals with increasing specificity.</p>

                <p>Le cycle d'O. maritimus a pu être réalisé au laboratoire sur des jeunes Larus
                    argentatus captifs ou sur des jeunes Columbia livia domestica. La femelle dépose
                    de 10 à 200 oeufs 20 à 30 jours après le repas sanguin. Le temps de
                    développement des oeufs varie de 11 à 21 jours. La larve peut se fixer sur un
                    hôte dès le 4ème jour. Le repas larvaire dure en moyenne 110 heures. La mue
                    larvaire s'effectue 8 jours après le repas sanguin et confor- mément à ce qui
                    est connu chez les Alectorobius, une deuxième mue, nymphale celle-là, se produit
                    8 jours après la première. Après chaque repas sanguin une nouvelle mue se
                    produit jusqu'à l'obtention des adultes. Ainsi de 3 à 6 stades nymphaux sont
                    nécessaires. Les émergences des femelles sont décalées d'un stade nymphal par
                    rapport au mâle. Au total au laboratoire, le cycle a pu être réalisé, en ne
                    tenant compte que des temps moyens de chaque stase, en 320 jours. Il est
                    probable que le cycle d'O. maritimus demande plusieurs années dans la nature du

                <p>Hookworm larvae (L3): GSH-induced feeding The host signal(s) that initiates
                    development of invading hookworm larvae is essentially undefined, especially for
                    species infecting humans. The resumption of feeding by infective larvae (L3) is
                    undoubtedly an early event in the infectious process, and may, therefore, serve
                    as an in vitro marker for the resumption of development. We recently described
                    an in vitro feeding assay for Ancylostoma caninum L3 (J.Parasitol., in press)
                    and have used a modified version of this assay to characterize feeding in A.
                    duodenale L3. Larvae are axenized in a buffer containing antibiotics for 12-18
                    hours and then incubated at 37 C with 57 CO, for approximately 24 hours. After
                    incubation, larvae are “fed"" FITC-BSA for 1-2 hours, and washed and examined
                    microscopically under UV illumination. The number of feeding larvae, containing
                    dye in their intestinal lumina, is expressed as a percentage of the total number
                    of larvae counted. Unlike A. caninum L3, A. duodenale L3 were not stimulated by
                    10% serum, but reduced glutathione (GSH) initiated feeding in a
                    concentration-dependent manner, reaching maximum levels (827) at 5-10mM GSH.
                    Feeding activity reaches a plateau by 16-24 hours of incubation.</p>
                <p>Glutathione analogues containing substituted sulfhydryl groups are active, while
                    other reducing agents (i.e., cysteine and DTT) are inactive, indicating that a
                    free SH group is not required for stimulation. Oxidized glutathione (GSSG) fails
                    to stimulate feeding, suggesting that large moeities bound at the cysteine SH of
                    GSH may interfere with GSH receptor binding. (Supported by NIH Grants AI-22662,

                    strigatus (Lebour, 1908) and M. fossarum (Bartoli, 1965). Each may use the
                    peppery furrow-shell, Scrobicularia plana as primary host and the oystercatcher,
                    Haema- topus ostralegus as final host. M. minutus uses only the estuarine
                    cockle, Cerastoderma edule in northern and western Europe as intermediate host
                    where it occurs enclosed in mantle tissue 1 a wedge-shaped cavity beneath the
                    umbo and causes no apparent damage to the host. strigatus occurs in the same
                    microhabitat within C. edule near the open coast in Wales” Er together with M.
                    fossarum, enclosed in mantle ‘tissue or free in the extrapallial space in a

                <p>strigatus occurs near mid body but M. fossarum beneath the umbo or under the
                    perio- stacum along the growing edges of the valves where, free in the lagoon
                    cockle, Cerasto- derma glaucum, it severely inhibits shell growth. (C. edule may
                    be infected experiment- aly with free M. fossarum but not C. glaucum with M.

                    strigatus or M. fossarum. These observa- tions suggest that M. minutus and M.

                    detailing the influence of temperature on egg hatching of the reindeer warble
                    fly (Hypoderma tarandi). H.tarandi, a myiasis- producing reindeer parasite,
                    oviposites eggs on the hairs of reindeer (Rangifer tarandus) during the summer
                    months. In the laboratory, newly oviposited eggs were incubated at one of
                    several constant temperatures, ranging from 4©C to 40°C, and were inspected at
                    eight hour intervals for egg hatching. Under these experimental conditions, the
                    time from oviposition until hatching ranged from three days to two weeks,
                    depending on the temperature, and hatching only occurred at treatment
                    temperatures betwean 209 to 37°C. There was a non-linear acceleration in
                    incubation rate with increasing temperature, while the proportion of eggs
                    hatching was highest and least variable at the mid-ranges of the temperatures
                    where hatching occurred.</p>
                <p>The temperature range measured in the summer pelt of reindeer was consistent with
                    the experiméntal temperature treatments that produced the highest hatching
                    rate.</p>
                <p>We discuss how the constraints of the host environment coupled with temperature-
                    dependent hatching success may impose a selective pressure on oviposition

                    (Emeritus), London, U.K.</p>
                <p>Hypnozoite theory of malarial relapse Since the announcement in 1980 of the
                    discovery of two distinct populations of hepatic pre-erythrocytic stages in an
                    experimental, sporozoite-transmitted, relapsing simian malaria due to P.
                    cynomolgi bastianellii, and of the resultant formulation of the hypno- zoite
                    theory of malarial relapse, considerable evidence has accumulated for its
                    support.</p>
                <p>The hypnozoite theory states that subpopulations of sporozoites either begin
                    schizogony shortly after entering the hepatocyte, or are transformed into
                    (uninucleate) hypnozoites of differing dormancy potential, and that true
                    relapses occur when pre-programmed hypno- zoites are later activated to begin
                    schizogony, apparently by an internal trigger.</p>
                <p>Experimental evidence in favor of the hypnozoïite theory includes (1)
                    simultaneous elimination of hypnozoiïites and relapse potential by primaquine,
                    but not by chloroquine, (2) marked reduction in numbers of hepatic schizonts
                    during initial patency, but without change in hypnozoite numbers, (3) presence
                    of hypnozoïites in relapsing, but not in non- relapsing species, (4)
                    visualization of hypnozoïites up to 74 months (229 days) after sporozoite
                    injection, (5) numerical schizont/hypnozoïte relationships consistent with
                    widely disparate relapse patterns, both in vivo and in tissue culture, and (6)
                    behavior of hypnozoites in a manner consistent with relapse response upon
                    treatment with anti- folate agents. Finally, the hypnozoite theory is readily
                    able to explain the various patterns of latency and relapse seen in (especially)
                    P. vivax strains, and serves as a unifying concept to explain relapse behavior
                    in malaria in general. In contrast, no bona fide evidence to refute the
                    hypnozoiïte theory has been demonstrated. _ These observations lead to the
                    conclusion that the hypnozoiïite theory should be consi- dered the legitimate
                    successor to the cyclic schizogony theory originally proposed by Shortt and
                    Garnham in 1948.</p>

                    - Proglottis development - Egg count Two events occurring very late in the
                    development of proglottides in Hymenolepis nana have been studied. (1) The
                    oncosphere larva at first develops with Tts anteroposte- rior axis perpendicular
                    to the egg's long axis (type A), but later the larva rotates 90° so that all the
                    six hooks become parallel to the latter (type B). The part of the worm showing
                    such a transition could be identified very accurately, suggesting that the
                    transition from type À to type B eggs is rapid and quite synchronous within each
                    proglottis. The average number of proglottides present posterior to this par-
                    ticular stage was 91-116 in worms from days 14-18, but increased to 180 in worms
                    from day 20. (2) The discharge of eggs from the proglottides that are still
                    attached to the worm was known to occur in vitro. However, to which extent such
                    "precocious" egg discharge occurs in the worm's normal environment was not
                    clear. Worms were recov- ered from male ddY mice 8-20 days after 5-cysticercoid
                    infection, and fixed immedi- ately in hot 10% formalin. Then, beginning from the
                    worm's posterior end, worm fragments, each consisting of 5 proglottides, were
                    serially cut out, placed separate- ly on glass slides, and dissected under
                    stereomicroscope to release eggs. All eggs in each fragment were counted under
                    microscope, and this procedure was continued until less than 50% of the eggs in
                    the fragment were of type B. In all worms studied, the most posterior fragments
                    contained much fewer eggs than more anterior ones, indicating that a
                    considerable numb2r of eggs had been discharged. Such a reduction in the number
                    of eggs occurred in 5-5G nosterior proglottides among worms from 8-18 days of
                    infection, and in 20-75 proslottides in worms from day 20.</p>

                    from chicken was carried out in Xiamen &gt; South China. The black fly, Simulium
                    (Gomphostilbia) metatarsale Brunetti, 1911, served as the natural transmitted
                    vector, amd the development of its sporogony was completed in this fly within 3
                    to 4 days after feeding. By 2-5 minutes, the exfla- gellation of microgametocyte
                    could be seen in the midgut of fly, while the ookinete was first found at 60
                    minutes. By 72-84 hrs, the mature oocysts were formed in the midgut, measuring
                    14-16.2 by 11.5-15/u in diameter, containing 30-50 sporozoites and one residual
                    body. By 96 hrs, the free sporozoites were also found in the mid- gut and
                    salivary gland. In general, the development of asexual schizogony consisted of
                    two types of schizont, namely hepatic schizont and macrophagous schizont. There
                    was no megaloschizont being found in any organs of infected chicken. The mature
                    hepatic schizonts were found in the hepatic cells 72 hrs after inoculation, with
                    more than 100 merozoites. The macrophagous schizonts could be present in the
                    macro- phagous cells of different organs such as heart, kindey, lung, liver,
                    intestine, lymphatic gland, spleen, bone marrow and brain 72-120 hrs after
                    inoculation. The merozoite was first found in the blood cells such as red cell,
                    monocyte and reti- culocyte 108 hrs after infection, but the mature gametocytes
                    were found, 13 days after infection . The parasitemia reached theirs peaks
                    varied from 15-25 days. At this time, the ratio between both macrogametocyte and
                    microgametocyte was 2.3:1.</p>

                    required 24-30 days after infection. The large type schizont found at 12 days
                    was proved to be the first generation schizont which contained the large
                    crescent merozoites measured 1.3-3.5/u in size. In the progress of
                    exoerythrocytic schizogony, a cytomere stage was present. The mature schizonts
                    were polymorphous in shape, such as globular or oval forms, bilobed shapes and
                    toutuous branches. In general, there had no clinical pictures from the infected
                    pigeon, but there could be anemia, appitite, pneumonia, liver hypertrophy and
                    splenomegaly in some cases of heavy infection. No periodic fluctuation of

                <p>Its larvae were recently recorded as blood sucking maggot attacking pig producing
                    myiasis.The cognition of their behavior is rather elementary at present.The
                    following are the main results obtained.The adult flies are sexually mature 3
                    day after emerging.</p>
                <p>They copulated at 9a.m. to 5 p.m.,the duration is about 5-30 minutes. The female
                    lays her eggs in batches of 50 or more on the dry dirt and straw of floor of
                    darkish pigsty.</p>
                <p>Their favourite activities are weed flowering shrubs and the pigsties.They fly
                    into the house and stay on railing,floor and wall and may copulate in there.The
                    fly season has two peaks,the first in April to June and the second in August to
                    Octorber.But the flies are found in whole year.The adult flies may hibernate
                    through the winter.Experimental work shows that the life-span of flies are 18-88
                    days.The larvae hatch within 2 days.</p>
                <p>Their breeding places are the darkish pigsty,they shelter on dry straw and loose
                    soil of floor or on crack and corner of wall.The activities of larvae were
                    mostly nocturnal,.</p>
                <p>The feeding habits of the larvae are penetrating the skin and sucking the blood
                    of pigs, particularly those asleep on the earth.They may remain on the pig about
                    1-14 hours and the larvae appear the particular position raising up its body in
                    45290, Affer a full feeding the fed larvae have a reddish black gut and can
                    become itself bright red in colour,.They can leave and fall on the ground.The
                    capacity in sucking blood is about 4.6-5.7mg. The larvae have the strong ability
                    of drought resistance and fast tolerance.</p>

                <p>Strongyioides stercoralis - larval migration Several techniques were used to test
                    the validity of the classical pulmonary migration route allegedly traveled by
                    Strongyloides stercoralis larvae. These studies were conducted in
                    specific-pathogen-free, newborn pups. In the first instance, autoradiography was
                    used to detect migrating larvae enroute to the intestines, either from the skin
                    in primary infections or from the ileum/colon in simulated autogenous
                    infections. The autoradiographic data were analysed in the context of
                    mathematical models based on different hypothetical migratory routes (3 for
                    primary infections, 2 for autoinfections). Compartmental analysis, comparing
                    observed autoradiographic data to the hypothetical models, gave no reason to
                    reject the simple idea that the pulmonary route was just one of many possible
                    pathways to the duodenum. Secondly, temporal tracheal sampling of pups infected
                    with radiolabeled larvae indicated that at no time was the number of larvae
                    moving through the trachea adequate to account for the number of larvae arriving
                    in the intestines. Finally, gamma camera scintigraphy of pups infected with
                    radiolabeled larvae showed that at no time after infection was substantial
                    radioactivity associated with the lungs. In all of these approaches we found no
                    reason to reject the null hypothesis, which assumed no directed migration, in
                    favor of the classical pulmonary route.</p>

                    avenue, 31, Tbilisi, 380030, USSR Trichinella spiralis, T.nativa The aïm of this
                    investigation is to establish the species compositi- on of agents of
                    Trichinellosis in domestic and wild memmals in Georgia.</p>
                <p>À lot of total preparations and serial microscopic sections of in- vased material
                    were examined, It was known that Trichinella spiralis was the only agent of
                    Trichi- nellosis in Georgia. Another species causing Trichinellosis has been
                    established by our study, it was T.nativa., The latter was found only in fox.
                    T.spiralis is more widely spread in Georgia in netural and in synenfthropic Foci
                    of Trichinellosis, As these foci are in cons- tant and rather intensive contacts
                    T,spiralis becomes spread all over the Georgia. The ways of circulation of
                    Trichinellosis in the natural and man-made landscapes are closely connected both
                    with vertebrates (predatory mammals) and invertebrates, Among the invertebrates
                    there are the species which during the process of evolution developed the
                    specialization to fooding on the carrion; just these species are of great
                    importance in spreading of Trichinellosis in Georgia, It was shown (Kurashvili,
                    Matsaberidze et a1,,1989) that the larvae of flies (Diptera) were the
                    significant links in the circulation of muscle forms of trichinelles, S3.E 33

                <p>Litomosoides carnii a natural filariid nematode parasite of the cotton rat
                    Sigmodon hispidus has long been used as a model in filariasis research. However,
                    many aspects of its functional anatomy remain poorly understood. Third - and -
                    fourth- stage larvae were isolated from the vector and definitive host
                    respectfully and, processed for electron microscopy. The digestive tract is well
                    differentiated in both larvae. In the third-stage larva, the anterior portion of
                    the oesophagus is distinctly muscular. The cuticularized triradiate lumen is
                    occluded by a plug-like matter. The posterior portion is cellular with an inner
                    muscular core and an outer glandular sleeve. The gland cells contain numerous
                    secretory granules. Though the intestinal epithelium has been laid down, no
                    lumen has differentiated. In the fourth stage larva, the oesophageal lumen is
                    surrounded by a muscular epithelium made up of 6 cells. The intestinal
                    epithelium is made up of cuboidal cells surrounding a well differentiated lumen.
                    Few stumpy microvilli have been formed at their lumenal surface. The micro-
                    anatomy indicate that at these stages, the digestive system may not be
                    functional and nutrients may be assimilated via the transcuticular route.</p>

                <p>Study of natural infections of Haemoproteus and Plasmodium of reptilian hosts
                    demonstrated a pronounced inequity in the sex ratio of the gametocytes.
                    Microgametocytes outnumbered macrogametocytes in 6 species of Haemoproteus and 2
                    species of Plasmodium, macrogametocyte dominance was found in 4 species of
                    Haemoproteus and in a species of Fallisia. In all but 4 of these species the
                    dominance for a particular sex gametocyte in the followed up individual hosts
                    (some up to 8 months) remained the same from the early period of high
                    parasitaemia to the large stage of chronic low parasitaemia. In these species
                    sex ratio among young gametocytes was similar to that found in mature stages.
                    The extent of disparity in some species increased towards the late chronic stage
                    of the infection. In two species of Haemoproteus and the two species Plasmodium
                    the dominance by a particular sex gametocyte consolidated only in an advanced or
                    even late stage of the parasitaemia when only mature gametocytes were found in
                    the peripheral blood. Sexual disparity of gametocytes may affect the chances of
                    establishment of infection in the vector host and may serve a primary or a
                    contributing adverse factor in the transmission of haemosporidian
                    infections.</p>

                    de l'oocyste pour se diviser et donner des sporocystes chez le même individu

                    d'infestation connus chez les hémogrégarines peuvent potentiellement être

                <p>Gastric myiasis - Gasterophilus pecorum - life cycle Reported herein are three
                    rare cases of massive infestation by Gasterophi- lus pecorum larvae III in the
                    stomach of free-ranging horses în Umbria Tcentra Italy). Larvae of Gasterophilus
                    intestinalis - species with which G.pecorum is always associated in the gastric
                    site - were in fact unusually very few. Comparative data of the life cycle of
                    the two species are there- fore given, in order to explain the prevalence in
                    most cases of G.intesti- nalis on G.pecorum in the hosts'stomach. It is observed
                    that the duration of the oral migration of G.pecorum îs longer than that of
                    G.intestinalis; G.pecorum has only one yearly generation, whereas G.intestinalis
                    may often have two yearly overlapping generations throughout the year. At the
                    end of October, therefore, when larvae III of G.pecorum reach the host's stomach
                    they find the gastric mucosa completely infested by larvae III of the first
                    generation of G.intestinalis, arrived there as larvae II at the end of Au- gust,
                    and by larvae IT of the second generation of the same species. Hence, the
                    difficulty for G.pecorum larvae III to colonize the gastric mucosa in a large
                    number, in spite of the high number of them usually found on the host's soft
                    palate during the month of October.</p>

                    through which the larvae attain their attachment to the intestinal mucosae where
                    they develop towards the adult stage. There are no detailed reports that shows
                    the entire evagination process. The aim our work was to describe the
                    histological and external macroscopical aspects of evagination under light,
                    steroscopic and scanning electronmicroscopy.</p>
                <p>We obtained cysticerci form pig muscle and evagination was acomplished by
                    incubating them in culture medium supplemented with 25% bovihe bile. Cisticerci
                    vwere observed at different times of the evagination process and prepared for
                    microscopic observation. The images obtained illustrate the sequence followed by
                    the small worm as it emerges gradually from the parasitic bladder through its
                    natural opening. This process will be extensively illustrated by photographies
                    and histological images during the congress.</p>

                <p>Diptera, Sarcophagidae, Larval preestomal teeth, Scanning Electron Microscopy,
                    Myiasis.</p>
                <p>The larval preestomal teeth show remarkable modifications during the development
                    with regards to their structure and disposition. These structures were studied
                    by means of Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM), according to the technique
                    described by Ruïz-Martinez et al. (1989), The fist instar of W, magnifica Schin.
                    (Diptera: Sarcophagidae) does not show larval preestomal teeth, being the oral
                    ridges formed by two or three grooved folds, by where the food, directed to the
                    mouth, will pass. The function of these structures is assumed by a group of body
                    spines which are smaller and more sharpened than the remaning ones. These spines
                    are disposed around the buccal cavity, on an expansion of the first thoracic
                    segment.</p>
                <p>The second instar shows several rows of preestomal teeth, from 4 to 6, with a
                    progressive differentiation towards the mouth. Each preestomal tooth presents
                    its distal portion chitinized and the lobes are cutting surfaces. Each tooth
                    shows from 3 to 6 lobes.</p>
                <p>The third instar presents from 7 to 9 rows of preestomal teeth, each one of them
                    bearing from 4 to 9 lobes.</p>
                <p>Thus à complex system is conformed. It is organized in several ’fields'
                    (depending on the orientation of each digitation or lobe), which fall to the
                    folds of the oral ridge. The most complex preestomal teeth, that is, those
                    showing the biggest number of lobes, are near the mouth. The progressive
                    differentiation in the number of lobes occurs in à superior-inferior direction
                    (cephalic-buccal) and from outer part of the hook (latero- buccal). Thus the
                    preestomal teeth located in these zones do not show modifications in their apex
                    and appear as polyedric plates.</p>
                <p>Their functionality has an important role in larval feeding, since they produce
                    an abrasive effect and favour the attachment to the host, due to their
                    specialization and coordination in the protraction and retraction movements of
                    the buccal hooks during the anchoring process to the host.</p>

                    studied by means of Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM), according to the
                    technique performed and described by Ruïz-Martinez et al, (1989).</p>
                <p>The oral papilla or ventral complex is arranged laterally to each cephalic lobe,
                    placed directly on the oral ridges. This is the only sensillae complex of the
                    cephalic segment, showing modifications during the postembryonary development of
                    this fly.</p>
                <p>in instar |, it shows a simple structure, in which three types of sensillae are
                    present: 4 sensilläe like an unalveolated and unperforated protuberance, which
                    as à crown, celimt two big coeloconic sensillae, which ère separated by a fine
                    dividing wall. Under this complex a campaniform sensillum 1s disposed. The oral
                    papilla is disposed directly on the larval cuticle in this instar, since the
                    oral ridges is not still differentiated.</p>
                <p>In instars H and Il, its structure becomes more complex, being formed by three
                    types ef sensillae: 7 protuberance-shaped sensilla with different sizes, which
                    form a crown delmiting two coeloconic sensilla and, laterally, à Knob sensillum.
                    The disposition of the complex has shown a considerable change, since in these
                    phases it aaranges from a polyedric plate, differing from the preestomal larval
                    teeth, which form the oral ridge in these instars.</p>
                <p>Observing à varied group of ’Muscomorpha’ species, it can be deduced that the
                    tendency in the reduction mm number of sensilläe of the oral papilla, as an
                    adaptation to the parasitism must be an evolutive tendency, restricted to
                    certain families, while in others, this reduction has not the same.meaning. On
                    the other hand, the changes in disposition and composition of sensillae, must
                    have à functional meaning im the sense of an hypotetical modification of the
                    feeding habits during the larval development, or, simply, they may be associated
                    to the ontogenic changes of the oral ridges.</p>

                    which were parasiti zed with trypanosomes (31%).</p>
                <p>The trypomastigote was the only form observed on blood smears. In one dead shrew,
                    densely parasitized, was observed on liver impression smears, for the first
                    time, others morphological forms identical to amastigotes and spheromastigotes.
                    The inoculation in NNN medium of blood or spleen homogenate became positive in 4
                    animals.</p>
                <p>Probably the observation of the different forms of trypanosome's life cycle
                    depend on the infection time. On these insectivorous like in others mammals the

                    40292 Ultrastructure - Pelodera strongyloides - adult - dauer The ultrastructure
                    (by transmission electron microscopy, TEM) of some of the structures of the
                    adult and dauer larva is described and compared. This is significant because the
                    dauer larva is an inactive, relatively resistant facultative II stage with a
                    double cuticle.</p>
                <p>For TEM studies, the worms were processed in the usual manner, fixed in buffered
                    2% osmium tetroxide, stained in a 5% solution of phosphotungstic acid. Following
                    this the worms were embedded in an epoxy resin and sections were cut at 0.02 yum
                    with a ultramicrotome. Observations of sections were made with a Siemens
                    electron microscope.</p>
                <p>Some of the observations reported: the intestine is composed of a small number of
                    large cuboïdal cells. Most of the gut cells have variable amounts of xanthine
                    crystals, with considerably fewer in the dauer. It is suggested that the
                    xanthine in the dauer may be incorporated into specific metabolic pathways for
                    the production of DNA.</p>
                <p>The intestine and uterus are not inervated. Significant evidence indicates that
                    the bacillary Tining of the gut may consist of cilia.</p>
                <p>The sarcoplasmic zone of the musculature of dauer was greatly reduced and the
                    mitochondria and ribosomes appeared degenerate.</p>
                <p>Adjacent to the regions of endocuticle or the l1ining of the cloaca, esophages,
                    etc.</p>
                <p>there were no hypodermis nor muscle cells.</p>

                    First-stage larvae of Angiostrongylus cantonensis were experimentally fed to
                    juvenile snails(fed about 500 larvae each) of Achatina fulica which had been
                    previously examined and proved to be free from infection.The results obtained
                    were follows: 1.About 85.1% and 45.4% of the first-stage larvae were found in
                    muscular tissue of in- testine and heart(including those in the blood of vein)
                    of snails at 9,12 hours after infection,respectively;Above 44.4% larvae migrated
                    to the lung of snails at 24 hours after feeding.</p>
                <p>2.Most of the first-stage larvae fed to snails developed into third-stage larvae
                    within about 15-20 days.The first and second molt were observed 7-9 days and
                    10-15 days after infection of snails,respectively.</p>
                <p>3.The second-stage larvae were longer and wider than first-stage larvae.The
                    refractile granules obscured most of the internel organs,except the intestion
                    which was filled with larger refractile granules.The third-stage larvae were
                    more slender,nerve ring,excretory pore,and anus were at that time of development
                    clearly seen.</p>

                    strains were received by means of reproduction of an oocyst of each coccidia
                    species mentioned above. The prepatent period of E.nutria lasted on the average
                    7 days, that of E.vellucida 11 days, and of E.vision 7 days.The patent period
                    was 8, 11, 12 days correspondingly. Endogenic stages of E.nutria developed in
                    epithelial cells of fibres of jejunum and iliac, those of E.pellucida developed
                    in epithelial cells of fibres and glands of Lieberkühn of jejunum,iliac,and

                    nucleus, and the gamonts of the third species were above and under the nucleus
                    of epithelial cells.</p>
                <p>Intensive infection caused gamonts penetration into connective tissue. The
                    studied parasites were pathogenic and caused clinical display of disease when
                    the infection was intensive. Pathomorphological changes in the intestine were
                    characterized by acute catarrhal inflammation. There was atroohy of cytoplasm

                    Cellulosae Eighteen pigs were infected with Taenia solium eggs and divided into
                    mild,moderate and severe test groups.Changes-on cysticercui in tissues from many
                    parts of the body were observed at regular sta- ges after infection. Three
                    months after the infection,it was found that 17.65-20.11% of worms were
                    premature. Premature cysticertici were still seen 9 months after the infection,
                    indicating varios development of cysticertici.These results were quite different
                    from development phase of 60-70days as described previously. And after moderate
                    infection,rechallenging with the eggs did not increase the number of
                    cysticertici. The growth and development of cysticercui varied inversely with
                    infec- tion degree. The severer was infection, the higher was density, the
                    smaller was cysts, vice versa Pathologic examination showed that at the eariy

                    MICROFILARIAE Brugia pahangi microfilariae migrated from the midgut of Armigeres
                    subalbatus into the haemocoel and exsheated within minutes post ingestion.
                    During the course of the study, 5-10% of the micro- filariae were always seen in
                    the gut 2-3 days post ingestion.</p>
                <p>Failure to migrate was unlikely due to injuries inflicted during ingestion by the
                    mosquito. Ar. subalbatus lacks cibarial armatures though the pharynx is
                    moderately armed; pharyngeal armatures do not damage microfilariae. It is
                    suggested that microfilariae which are left in the midgut are the young and
                    immature worms. None of the B. pahangi microfilariae which were isolated from 24
                    hour old blood meals developed when inoculated into Ar. subalbatus.</p>

                <p>The mosqito, Armigeres subalbatus, blood-fed on cats infected with Brugia pahangi
                    ingested a smaller number of microfilariae than expected in an equivalent volume
                    of blood. It is suggested that microfilariae interfered with blood meal intake.
                    On average, mosquitoes fed on cats with low microfilariae density tend to ingest
                    a greater number of microfilariae and a larger blood meal. It ispostulated that
                    microfilariae may interrupt blood- feeding by blocking the food channel of the
                    proboscis or by causing a severe irritation in the midgut. Mosquitoes whose food
                    channels were blocked by microfilariae, would repeatedly attempt to refeed until
                    a full blood complement was ingested; the net effect was a larger number of
                    microfilariae and blood meal being ingested. Mosquitoes which ingested large
                    numbers of microfilariae all at once had smaller blood meals presumably severe
                    midgut irritation discourage the mosquitoes from refeeding.</p>

                    Steinernema glaseri and Heterorhabditis heliothidis NC1 produce infective
                    juveniles (IJ's) which invade and kill soil-dwelling insects. In insects, S.
                    glaseri pass through two (or more) amphimictic deuterotokous generations before
                    producing IJ's which invade new hosts but H. heliothidis is hetero- genous,
                    developing first to mictic, protandrous female-like, self-fertilising hermaphro-
                    dites which produce one (or more) amphogenous generations. These in turn give
                    rise to 1J's which develop into hermaphrodites in a new host. A re-examination
                    of life histories and karyotyping of these nematodes cultured in larvae of
                    Galleria mellonella shewed that in both generations of $S. glaseri sex ratio is
                    about 50:50 and the diploid chromosome number is 2n=9 in males and 2n=10 in
                    females indicating the male is the heterogametic sex and sex determination is of
                    the XX-XO type. In H. heliothidis, hermaphrodites produce first sons and
                    daughters and then hermaphrodite IJ's. The males must copulate with females for
                    the latter to produce offspring. The sex ratio is 4 females:1 male in both the
                    amphimictic generations, and the diploid chromosome number is 2n=14 in herma-
                    phrodites and females and 2n=13 in males. These results indicate that the
                    genetic mechanisms by which males are produced differ from those in S. glaseri
                    and in nematodes such as Caenorhabditis elegans.</p>

                    leishmaniasis caused by L. major and toxoplasmosis caused by T. gondii are
                    prevalent among man and animals in several loca- lities in Egypt particularly in
                    the Nile Delta and Sinai. Double infec- tion may take place, In this paper, it
                    was intended to study the concom- itant infection in albino mice The results
                    showed that the clinical and histopathological pictures differ in conconmitant
                    infection from that shown by infection with either parasite alone, The
                    Toxoplasma parasites help in the activation and dis- semination of L. major for
                    a certain. On the other hand, the Leishmania parasites attenuate the virulence
                    of T. gondii. Therefore, leishmaniasis and toxoplasmosis must be diagnosed
                    parasitologically.</p>

                    Majadahonda, Madrid. Spain Leishmaniasis, HIV, immunodepression, diagnosts We
                    have tested over 2500 human sera for leishmaniasis coming from almost all
                    provinces in Spain; of these, 82 were positive. Combining both biopsy and
                    serology the efficiency in diagnosis is higher than 92%. In 28 (34.1%) of these
                    82 cases there was evidence of immunodepression having different origins: 16
                    (19.5%) associated with HIV infection, 4 with cronic ethylic hepatopathy, 3 with
                    Hodgkin disease, 3 with kidney and heart trans- plant, 1 with Lupus and 1 with
                    Crohn disease. In the cases associated with HIV infection two serological groups
                    were established: in 4 out of these 16 cases amastigotes were ob- served in
                    biopsies but no specific antibodies against leishmania were detected. The re-
                    maining 12 patients had high antibodies titers against the parasite. Three
                    patients de- veloped diffuse cutaneous leishmaniasis.</p>
                <p>From the previous data L.infantum could be considered an opportunistic parasite.
                    Trying to analyze the basis of this subclinical infection we checked 637 HIV
                    positive sera to detect antileishmania antibodies, 284 coming from asymptomatic
                    individuals and 353 from patients presenting clinical signs compatible with
                    leishmaniasis (fever, splenomegaly, leucopenia or adenopaties). We have not
                    found any positive sera for leishmaniasis out of those in which the parasitic
                    infection was strongly suspected by the clinicians. The hypoendemicity of
                    leishmaniasis in Spain (0.30 cases per 100.000 inhabitants) increases the
                    difficulties to establish the level of subclinical infections. Their detection
                    is important as leishmaniasis might have increased morbidity and mortality in
                    immunocompro-— missed patients.</p>

                    protease inhibitors, macroglobulins Physiological protease inhibitors from the
                    macroglobulin (MG) family are found in tissues and in the plasma of mammals (JBC
                    254:11539, 1989). Alpha- 2-MG (A2M) is the most studied one and by complexing to
                    all classes of proteinases it inhibits their action on high molecular weight
                    substrates.</p>
                <p>Immunological effects were reported for A2M and we have shown that A2M can
                    inhibit the penetration of Trypanosoma cruzi (TC) into host cells. In rats A2M
                    is characteristic of the acute phase response, regulated by IL6. In the mouse
                    other MG (murinoglobulins -MuG-) were described, whose function still is
                    unknown. To investigate possible variations in the levels of A2M (MuA2M) in TC-
                    infected mice, we assayed A2M by rocket immunoelectrophoresis (IP) and by ELISA.
                    We used three models: Swiss mice infected with Colombiana or Y strains and
                    BALB/CJ mice infected with the Tehuantepec strain . Purified MuA2M was used
                    throughout the experiments both as standards as well as the coating protein in
                    the ELISA. Three antisera against MuA2M specifically immunoprecipitate it but
                    cross-react with other MuG's, so that mixtures of A2M and MuG's coulä not be
                    discriminated by ELISA. When compared with the IP technique the results indicate
                    variations in A2M as compared to other MuG's. There is an increase of A2M levels
                    in all the three models studied, when parasitaemia reachs 10° parasites/ml. Mice
                    infected with the Y strain showed also an enhancement in A2M levels soon after
                    the infection (8, 12 and 24 h). In the BALB/CJ model we detected by ELISA an
                    enhancement in MuG levels between 35 and 63 days after infection, which could be
                    confirmed by the isolation of MuG by HPLC from the plasma of mice colected 49

                    spectrum of human leishmaniasis, causing cuta- neous, mucosal and visceral
                    leishmaniasis. In order to evaluate the biological behavior of La strains
                    isolated from Balb/c mice with 5 x 106 stationary phase promastigotes with 3 La
                    strains (types by isoenzymes and monoclonal antibodies, a courtesy of Drs. H.

                    be linked with particular diseses /abnormalities. Gene frequency studies using 3
                    genetic markers viz, ABO blood type and haemoglobin qgenotypes were carried out
                    in 4 ethnic groups inhabitinq Cross River and Akwa Ibom States of Nigeria with a
                    total population of 2,218. The distribution of the ABO blood types in the 4
                    groups showed a high O frequency, followed by A, B and AB.The lowest O frequency
                    (50.9%) was found in the Annang group, lowest À frequency (18.15%) in the
                    Ejagham group, lowest B frequency (11.75%) in the Annang group and the lowest AB
                    frequency (2.24%) in the Efik group. Rhesus negative blood type was absent in

                    rapportent les résultats du dosage de l'Hormone de croissance (CH) sérique, par

                    sont réalisés avant et après traîtement stibié. Des sérums appartenant à la
                    fraterie ont servi de témoins. Au total, 69 sérums sont testés et se
                    répartissent comme suit : 21 avant traîtement, 28 après traîtement et 20 sérums
                    témoins. La comparaison de la population témoin et des enfants atteints ne
                    montre pas de différence significative entre les mayennes de CH(respectivement
                    3,58 + 4,3 et 5,6 + 4,3 ng/ml). La moyenne des dosages effectués après

                    cures de Glucantime et le délai de prélèvement. Cette baisse du taux de GH par
                    rapport au taux initial préthérapeutique (5,6 + 4,3 ng/ml) n'est qu'apparente,

                    Canada T2N IN4 giardiasis-pathogenesis of malabsorption The pathogenic
                    mechanisms producing diarrhea and malabsorvtion in giardiasis remain unclear. We
                    previously demonstrated that giardiasis in weanling gerbils caused diarrhea and
                    retarded growth not associated with decreased food intake, and that trophozoite
                    colonization reached a peak 6 days post inoculation. The aim of this study was
                    to define the biochemical, histomorphological, ultrastructural and functional
                    alterations in the jejunum during acute giardiasis. Weanling protozoan free ml
                    gerbils (35-45g) were orogastrically inoculated (I,n=34) with saline containing
                    2x10 trophozoites of a pathogenic strain of Giardia isolated from the stools of
                    a clinically ill child. Age and weight matched controls (C,n=31) received saline
                    only.</p>
                <p>On day 6, segments of jejunum were excised and disaccharidase activities,
                    crypt-villus ratios, enterocytes migration rates (bromodeoxyuridine uptake), and
                    brush border surface area (transmission electron electron microscopy) were
                    calculated. Electrolyte transvort was assessed in vitro in stripped jejunal
                    mucosa in Ussing chambers under short-circuited conditions. Unidirectional and
                    net Na and CI fluxes were determined during basal and glucose-stimulated
                    periods. In I compared to C, sucrase and maltase were impaired, villi were
                    unaltered, crypts were hyperplastic, enterocyte migration rate was enhanced, and
                    brush border surface area was decreased. Infection did not alter basal
                    electrolyte transport but significantly impaired glucose-stimulated Na Jm-s and
                    Jnet. in conciusion, acute giardiasis impairs jejunal disaccharidases, reduces
                    jejunal glucose-stimulated Na absorption, and increases enterocyte migration
                    rate thus causing crypt hyperplasia. The enzymatic and . transport abnormalities
                    correlate with diffuse loss of brush border surface area but not with villus
                    atrophy.</p>

                    Eicosanoids are potent immunoregulators of immune cell function which may affect
                    the pathogenesis and immunopathology of infectious diseases. We determined the
                    in vitro generation and release of the cyclooxygenase metabolite of arachidonic

                    in pathogenesis.</p>
                <p>Axenic trophozoites (5 x 106) produced spontaneously high levels of PGE2 (645
                    pg/3 hr) that increased up to 45% above controls in the presence of AA substrate
                    as determined by RIA. PGE) synthesis and release were inhibited by 50% with the
                    cyclooxygenase inhibitor, indomethacin (100 HM), 65% with the phospholipase À
                    inhibitor, hydrocortisone (1mM), and 84% with both drugs in combination after 12
                    hours post-drug exposure. Protein kinase C inhibitors,
                    1-(5-isoquinolinesulphonyl)2-methylpiperazine (H7, 50 UM) and sphingosine (10
                    HM), inhibited PGE) release by 31 and 26%, respectively. In the presence of AA,
                    PGE) release was not enhanced by amebae with phagocytic stimuli, human red blood
                    cells and opsonized zymosan or with soluble stimuli, calcium ionophore (A23187)
                    and phorbol myristate acetate. Amebae treated with indomethacin and
                    hydrocortisone, individually or in combination, inhibited amebic adherence to
                    Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells at 4°C by up to 40%. In contrast, the killing
                    of CHO cell monolayers at 37°C was inhibited by 58% by indomethacin-treated
                    amebae and 75% by indomethacin and hydrocortisone pre- treatments in
                    combination; hydrocortisone treatment alone was without effect. Our findings
                    demonstrate PGE&gt; synthesis and release by E. histolytica by a mechanism that
                    is largely dependent on amebic phospholipase À activity and suggest a role for
                    PGE2 in pathogenesis. PGE2 release by amebae can have important implications in
                    inflammatory and immune reactions in amebiasis. Supported by MRC.</p>

                    of the small intestine of humans with the parasitic protozoon Giardia lamblia
                    may have an asymptomatic course or it may produce acute or chronic diarrhea. In
                    order to establish if the different clinical outcome of giardiasis in children
                    could be due, at least partially, to strain differences, isolates from
                    asymptomatic and symptomatic cases studied in Mexico City were axenically
                    cultured. Isoenzyme electrophoresis demonstrated remarkable homogeneity in 7
                    enzyme patterns and no consistent differences between isolates from symptomatic
                    and asymptomatic human infections. The homogeneity between different isolates
                    was also demonstrated when the surface charge of parasites was measured by
                    cellular electrophoresis and binding of cationized ferritin particles. We have
                    now studied the cytopathic effect of different isolates on monolayers of
                    epithelial cells in culture (MDCK cells).</p>
                <p>Addition of trophozoites of G. lamblia produces a moderate, but significant
                    increase in transmural electrical resistance of monolayers mounted in Ussing
                    chambers. This is in contrast to the effect of another intestinal parasitic
                    protozoon, Enfamoeba histolytica, that rapidly abolishes transmural resistance
                    due to intense lytic activity on target cells. Ultrastructural examination by
                    means of scanning and transmission electron microscopy revealed focal areas of
                    depletion of epithelial cells microvilli at sites of contact with G. lamblia
                    trophozoites and increased deposition of cytoplasmic lipid dropletes. The
                    results suggest that G. lamblia trophozoites produce subtle metabolic and
                    membrane transport changes in target epithelial cells. Our in vitro assay did
                    not detect consistent differences in virulence between isolates of G. lamblia
                    obtained from symptomatic or carrier infections.</p>

                    syndrome usually occurs in an individual with no previous known lung disease.
                    The purpose of the study is to elucidate possibilities that clot lysis could be
                    ‘the first step in neutrophil-mediating injury of capillary endothelium. This is
                    with accordance to an hypothesis which postulates that ARDS is a
                    complement-mediated situation. Blood fibrinolytic activity has been studied on
                    50 patients who are considered to be at high risk of developing ARDS. The
                    methods of study have been developed by Ukranian Academy of Sciences, USSR. The
                    blood of the said patients has high fibrinolytic activity, indicating that a
                    study on the condition of humoral factors can be used as a way of prognosising
                    the development ARDS in patients who have manifested one or more clinical

                    values were normal after infection ( with Amprolium) but after challenge,
                    haemoconcentration was found coincidental with the opg increase.WCC increased
                    along the experiment.From our results it was clear that Amprolium under these
                    conditions was an effective coccidiostat for kid goats but the animals were
                    unable to mount a protective immune response against challenge at least as
                    assessed by opg,clinical and haematological estimations. At slaughter time ( 2%

                    die in the second week of infection. They exhibit a dramatic decrease in body
                    temperatu- re in the last 24 hours before death, and histopathological analysis
                    of brain tissue revealed hemorrhages. Death early in the second week, collapse
                    of temperature control and hemorrhages in the brain are strongly correlated.
                    Development of the syndrome is strongly dependent on the function of the spleen
                    (absent in splenectomized, or spleen irradiated mice, even when performed during
                    infection), and on the function of T-cells (absent in congenital T-cell
                    deficient mice, and after treatment with an anti-T-cell serum). The fatal
                    cerebral syndrome is not found when mice are treated with dexamethasone before
                    the fifth day of infection or when treated with serum or IgG from immune

                <p>Trichuris muris, T cell phenotype The immune response to T. muris is under well
                    defined genetic control, with different inbred strains of mice exhibiting
                    considerable variation in the rate at'which they can expel the parasite from the
                    intestine. Such distinct explusion phenotypes enables the analysis of the
                    mechanisms of immunity operating during both acute and chronic I. muris
                    infections. T lymphocytes are knoun to play a central role in the development of
                    protect- ive immunity to T. muris although the T cell subsets involved remain
                    unidentified. The current study was designed to analyse the subsets of T cells
                    involved in the generation of a protective immune response in resistant strains
                    of mice, or a state of non-respons- iveness in strains of mice unable to expel
                    the parasite. Subset analysis was carried out on mesenteric lymph node cells
                    using antibodies against T cell surface markers (Lyt-2, L3T4, Thy-1) in
                    conjunction with fluorescence activated cell sorting. Host worm burdens were
                    also determined. In addition, strain variation in the T cell receptor repertoire
                    during the course of infection was studied using antibodies against five
                    different Vf gene products.</p>

                <p>Trichomonas vaginalis, virulence, cytotoxicity, cytoadherence Virulence of
                    various strains of Trichomonas vaginalis was determined by the evaluation of
                    internal lesions in mice inoculated intraperitoneally.</p>
                <p>The cytopathologic effects were studied on HeLa cells cultures by deter- mining

                <p>The results obtained by this way showed a direct correlation among three
                    parameters, being the most virulent strain the most cytotoxic and those that
                    showed the greatest adherence index.</p>
                <p>Parasites of different virulence were homogenized in isotonic-medium and
                    fractionated by differential centrifugation in sacarose 1.5 M and subse- quent
                    treatment with octyl-D-glycopiranoside. By this method, six frac- tions were
                    isolated and their cytopathologic activity determined by direct count of dead
                    HeLa cells as well as measuring the liberation of radiolabe- lled Cr. In
                    addition, experiments about cytopermeability were carried out with all isolated
                    fractions.</p>
                <p>SDS-PAGE was performed in order to identify the different proteic frac- tions.
                    Results showed that the soluble fractions had the largest amount of proteins in
                    the virulent strains. Proteins with molecular weights of 20 kD and up of 34 kD
                    which appeared in all fractions could be responsi- ble for toxicity.</p>

                    only in experimental animals with high levels of parasitaemia. We recently
                    re-examined 37 patients with symptomatic acute P. falciparum infection and 13
                    Swiss albino mice experimentally infected with P. bergei and 4 control

                    Hicsonmez et al., 1988). Our aim was to study the effect of the Sthes derivative
                    of pentavalent antimony-Solusurmin on the picture of white blood of VL patients.
                    16 VL patients between the ages of 10 months and 6 years got specific treatment
                    with intravenous injection of Solusurmin at a daily dose of 0,1-0,15 g/kg/day,
                    the course dose being 1,4-1,8 g/kg for up to 1,5-3 weeks. Retrospective analysis
                    of white blood indices which was ca- rried out before and after the treatment
                    testifies for the decrease of leucocyte number in blood under the influence
                    of,Solusurmin. It should be noted that sregulocytopente lower than 1,5.107/1 was
                    found in 10 and lower than 1.0.109 /1 in 5 patients treated NEA this drug. As a
                    rule at the end of the treatment the number of leucocytes in patients! blood in-
                    creased up to 3-4.107//1, Though the reason of leucocyte decrease in blo- od of
                    VL patients which got specific treatment with different derivati- ves of
                    pentavalent antimony is quite clear, the condition of white blood of VL patients
                    after the beginning of specific therapy should be under the constant control,
                    This would help to avoid such complications as the developient of septicemia

                <p>Anatomicopathological alterations produced by A. caninum larvae, during their
                    migration, are described in three batches of experimentally inoculated dogs.
                    Batch I. Dogs free of parasites, inoculated with 8 000 infecting larvae in
                    different regions of the back. Batch II. Dogs infected orally with 2 000 L-3
                    larvae, and confronted two months later with 8 0000 infecting larvae in the same
                    way as dogs from batch I. Batch III.</p>
                <p>Dogs inoculated with L-3 larvae antigen and then confronted with 8 000 infecting
                    larvae as the previous batches. Skin biopsies were obtained from the inoculated
                    regions of the animals (2, 4, 12, 24, 48, 72, 9%6, 120 hs). Parasitoscopic
                    studies of the feces were performed two months later. Batch I. The
                    histopathologic study showed an inflammatory process with polymorphonuclear
                    cells up to the 7th biopsy; on the 8th biopsy; mast cells, lymphocytes and
                    eosinophiles were also present. Larvae were only detected until the 5th
                    biopsy.</p>
                <p>Batch II. The first four biopsies showed larvae in the hair folicles and in the
                    sebaceous glands surrounded by an inflammatory process with polymorphonuclear
                    cells; eosinophiles and focal necrosis. From the 5th biopsy on, no larvae were
                    detected, but the inflammatory process and the necrotic foci remained,
                    disappearing in the last biopsy. Bwtch III. Larvae in hair folicles and
                    sebaceous glands were observed in the first wto biopsies accompanied by
                    polymorphonuclear inflammatory process. On the third biopsy, the inflammatory
                    process rached the surface muscle. From the 4th biopsy on, no larvae were found,
                    the necrotic foci and the inflamma- tory process decreased until disappearing at
                    the 8th biopsy. The parasitoscopic studies were positive for batches I and II,
                    and negative for batch III. Dogs of batch III were protected against infection
                    as can be inferred from the negative parasitoscopic results.</p>

                <p>Ten adults splenectomized merino sheep were divided into two groups. The five
                    animals cf the experimental group were infected by endovenous inoculation of 10°
                    parasitized erythrocytes. Sheep were carefully screened for the presence of
                    preexisting hemoparasitic disease by blood smears and serological (IFA) test
                    prior to experimental infection. Blood samples were collected daily during the
                    first 15 days postinfection, and each two days up to the 30 d.p.i.</p>
                <p>Four of the experimental group sheep died on days 4,5,5, and 9 postinfection, the
                    other one was euthanasied on day 60 p.i.</p>
                <p>Tissues were collected from brain, heart, lungs, liver, kidney, adreñnal gland,
                    small intestine and lymph node for the histopathologycal study.</p>
                <p>Changes in blood values were a fall in PVC, erythrocytes, haemoglobin, leucocytes
                    and thrombocytes. In coagulation parameters we have found a increase and later
                    decrease in fibrinogen concentration, prothrombin time and partial actived
                    thromboplastin time were prolonged and thrombin time was at the begining
                    decreased and lately increased. Plasmatic kallikrein values also increased on
                    days 3-4 postinfection.</p>
                <p>Fibrinogen degradation products were detected, its concentration one or two days
                    before dead was 10-14 %g/ml.</p>
                <p>Histopathological examination revealed acute lungs oedema and areas of infarction
                    in the kidney, with thrombi in arcifom arteries. In all other organs examined
                    haemorrhage was the most frecuent finding.</p>

                    lead to the rapid spread of B. acheilognathi throughout Europe. Ultrastructural
                    observations on the interactions between the scolex and anterior strobilia of
                    the worm and the gut wall of naturally and experimentally infected carp have
                    revealed that initial damage comprises separation of gut epithelial cells. This
                    can occur several millimeters from the scolex attachment site. At the latter
                    location villi, which are normally very prominent in uninfected fish are
                    flattened, the majority of the epidermis is absent and host cells are exuded
                    into the gut lumen. Accumulation of leucocytes occurs in the submucosa and
                    leucocytes, which may be in the process of migrating into the gut, are found
                    between the remaining epithelial cells. Macrophages, granulocytes and
                    lymphocytes are present on the surface of the worm and disruption of the
                    tegument occurs,. Studies on the interactions between the parasite and isolated
                    leucocytes are in progress.</p>

                    medium (20 000 L3) and high (50 000 L3) levels of Trichostrongylus colubriformis
                    infection on histology (villous length, crypt surface) and biochemistry (protein
                    content, leucine aminopeptidase (LAP) and alkaline phosphatase (AP) activities)
                    of the mucosa were assessed along the whole small intestine in rabbits used as
                    experimental model. The 500 L3 inocutum induced only minor changes to the
                    mucosa, compared to control, except some slight but significant increase in
                    crypt surface. With the 20 000 L3 infection, two regions were distinguished
                    along the small intestine. In the main site of infection, ji.e the proximal
                    region, reduction in villous length, crypt hyperplasia and reduced enzyme
                    activities were recorded. In the ileum, inhabited only by a few worms,
                    hyperplasia of both villi and crypts were present, associated with unchanged LAP
                    and AP activities.</p>
                <p>With the 50 000 L3 dose, high burdens of worms were found throughout the
                    intestine.</p>
                <p>They induced the most severe lesions, i.e. total or sub-total abrasion of villi,
                    doubling of crypt size and important decreases in LAP and AP values. Moreover,
                    these damages were generalised along the whole intestine. These results suggest
                    1) the existence of an adaptive response of the parasitised intestine beyond the
                    main site of infection provided the region is inhabited with reduced numbers of
                    worms ; 2) that the generally recognised dose-dependent expression of pathogenic
                    effects of worms could be attributed both to a higher severity of the lesions
                    and to a greater extent of the damages leading to a partial or total
                    disappearance of the adaptive region.</p>

                    Thirty laboratory hatched and reared mallard ducks (Anas platyrhynchos), were
                    experi- mentally infected with 200 or 550 metacercarial cysts of Sphaeridiotrema
                    globulus.</p>
                <p>Metacercariae were collected from naturally infected Goniobasis virginica snails.
                    Eight ducks fed 550 cysts died from excessive blood loss caused by
                    parasite-induced ulcerative hemorrhagic enteritis between day 5 and 6
                    postinfection (PI) with a range of 67 to 92 worms recovered per duck. All ducks
                    fed 550 cysts had prolonged prothrombin and acti- vated partial thromboplastin
                    times indicating the presence of a circulating anticoagu- lant or that multiple
                    factor deficiencies occurred. Twenty ducks fed 200 cysts survived the infection
                    with 2 to 43 worms recovered per duck at necropsy. Four ducks from this group
                    were killed on each of day 2, 4, 6, 8 and 10 PI to examine the process of worm
                    ex- pulsion and wound healing. Lymphocyctic infiltration was the primary
                    cellular response.</p>

                    vociferans) were studied by light microscopy and immunohistochemistry during a
                    vaccine trial with recombinant proteins of the ring-infected erythrocyte surface
                    antigen (RESA) of Plasmodium falciparum in order to evaluate whether this
                    malaria vaccine causes glomerular or interstitial pathological changes. The
                    deposition of IgG, C3, and P. falciparum antigens in the mesangium was
                    demonstrated by the peroxidase anti-peroxidase (PAP) method. RESA vaccination in
                    concert with repeated P. falciparum infections may contribute to the development
                    of glomerulopathy and interstitial nephritis in these animals. A relationship
                    hetween the severity of parasitemia at the time of death and the presence of
                    nephropathy is not apparent from this experiment.</p>

                    investigated in 17 Thai patients (10 males, 7 females; aged 13-57 years) with
                    severe falciparum malaria. In order to ensure both sampling of red cells before
                    bone marrow recovery and survival analysis under near-steady state conditions,
                    radioisotopic labelling was performed at the time of admission (0 hours) and
                    calculation of mean cell lifespan (MCL) was based on semi-logarithmic plots of
                    corrected counts from 60 hours onwards. Five patients received blood
                    transfusions, all within 48 hours of admission. The mean (+ SD) MCL was 44.3 +
                    21.7 days. Non-transfused patients had similar MCL values (43.5 + 20.4) to those
                    of transfused patients (45.5 + 27.3 days, p &gt; 0.8). Seven patients with
                    palpable splenomegaly had similar MCL values to those without (54.1 + 28.8 vs
                    37.2 + 12.3 days, p &gt; 0.1). There was no association between admission
                    haematocrit or parasitaemia and MCL (p &gt; 0.2 in each case), but there was a
                    weak inverse correlation between total serum bilirubin and MCL (r = -0.49, p
                    &lt; 0.025).</p>
                <p>These data suggest that, although there is wide variability between patients, the
                    mean MCL of nonparasitised erythrocytes in severe malaria is halved relative to
                    that found previously in healthy Thai volunteers (89.6 + 13.1 days, p &lt;
                    0.001) and significantly less than that reported in Thai patients with
                    uncomplicated P. falciparum infections studied after parasite clearance (56.8 +

                <p>Malaria, Brain, Macrophage, Free Radicals, Malaria in itself is a devastating
                    human malaise, but cerebral malaria is its most perilous offspring. In the
                    present study an attempt has been made to understand and comprehend this serious
                    and often fatal complication of malaria. The extent of involve- ment of brain
                    tissue during the course of a laboratory induced cerebral malaria was
                    investigated in Plasmodium knowlesi infected rhesus monkeÿys. The studies
                    demonstrated the typical features of cerebral malaria such as brain capillary
                    obstruction, adhesion of the infected erythrocytes to the walls of the
                    endothelium and swelling of the vessel endothelium. Furthermore, we found
                    involvement of the brain tissue, inspite of the fact that the peak parasitaemia
                    in the peripheral blood smears of infected monkeys was only 4-5%. The
                    electronmicroscopic findings revealed numerous macrophages in the blood vessels
                    of brain of monkeys. The brain tissue from control animals appeared completely
                    normal. The cytoplasm of the macrophages contained phagacytosed parasitized
                    erythrocytes and other inclusion bodies. Quite often, macrophages were found in
                    intimate contact with and attached to the endothelium. In recent years, workers
                    have also attempted to assess the possible role of highly reactive products of
                    oxygen termed free radicals in the pathogenesis of malaria. Free radicals are
                    released by neutrophils and by activated macrophages. This indiscriminate and
                    self-inflicted process appears to contribute significantly to tissue damage.
                    Based on the present studies and as gleaned from our previous work, we tend to
                    suggest that there is an active involvement of free radicals in the pathogenesis
                    of cerebral malaria.</p>

                    have been made. This study display several prominent degenerative lesions with
                    changes in cellular shapes, extensive vacuolation etc. in the mantle, lungs,

                    hepatopancreas. Certain amount of pigments develop as a result of infection. The
                    pigments are of complex nature showing the properties of melanin, haemosiderin,
                    haemofuscin, lipofuscin and haemoglobin. The mucopoly- saccharide content of the

                    - Liver Hepatoma, cholangiocarcinoma and liver fluke infection are rather
                    commonly found in Thailand. In epidemiological studies, food habits and food
                    contaminants namely the habit of eating raw fish, nitrate nitrite and
                    nitrosamines are related to the diseases. These contaminants are also studied as
                    a probable carcinogen in the carcinogenesis of the liver. Serum protein
                    especially the fast-reacting fractions in œ&amp; and B range of the
                    electrophoretic pattern may be used as an indicator of host responses not only
                    to a certain stage of nutritional disorder but also to cell damage by infections
                    or toxicants. Proteinase inhibitors fraction, have been using as an indicator of
                    the host responses to cell damage and also the process of cell regeneration in
                    malnutritional state, the hypothesis on carcinogenesis of both hepato-cellular
                    carcinoma and cholangiocarcinoma in Thailand can be proposed. The malignant
                    transformation begins primarily with the cell injury. Hepatitis B virus or food
                    toxicants cause liver cell necrosis whereas the liver flukes and their eggs
                    irritate and damage the cell lining of bile ducts. During the process of
                    regeneration, with superimposed malnutrition, the hyperplasia and proliferation
                    of these damaged cells may be more vulnerable to nitrosamine which contaminated
                    in food or formated in the gastrointestinal tract due to the high content of
                    nitrate, nitrite and amines in food. High level of bile acids and bile salts
                    resulted from cholestasis may play an important role as à promotor of
                    nitrosamine carcinogenic transformation. Furthermore, the host response of
                    malnourished individuals in both hepatitis and opisthorchiasis may also play a
                    possible role in carcinogenesis of these liver carcinomas.</p>

                    Cutaneous leishmaniasis induced by Leishmania mexicana amazonensis in the ear
                    pinna of mice is characterized by lesions of high growth and ulceration rates
                    which evolve to total erosion of ears both in susceptible Balb/cJ and in
                    resistant C57B1/6J. In susceptible mice ear lesions double in size each 6 days
                    and are usually 10-fold the footpad lesions or 30-fold tail lesions on the S3Oth
                    day after infection.</p>
                <p>Histopathology of ear nodule of resistant mice showed discrete mononuclear
                    infiltrate in subeithelial layer on the 3-4th day increasing to diffuse type on
                    the ?2nd week. On the 3rd week a dense mononuclear infiltrate containing central
                    area of macrophages as a granulomata, with few parasites but dispersed
                    immunoperoxidase positive material was seen. On the 4th week lesions depicted
                    cartilage invasion, transfixation of the plane of the pinna and ulceration.
                    Lesions in susceptible mice evolved similarly but showed progressive increase of
                    parasitized macrophages which produced a round, soft and vegetating tumor-like
                    nodule. Although the mean lesion size of Balb/c had been 3-fold the C57B1/6, all
                    mice, either resistant or susceptible, showed ulcerated ears on the 3rd month
                    and all of them lost eroded ears on the Ath month. Extensive analysis of
                    cervical lymph nodes, liver and spleen up to 5 months did not show evidence of
                    parasites in these organs, which suggests the ear leishmanide as a particular
                    case of in situ disease.</p>

                <p>At present great attention is paid to microscopic mites as an important allergic
                    substance of house dust.</p>
                <p>Firstly the dust of blat and mountaineus zones of Tashkent region in Uzbekistan
                    Was investigated. All in all 96 flats of patients with atopic bronchial asthma
                    and 65 flats of healthy people were checked, Probes of chest were taken from the
                    floors of tho rooms, bedding and other things by means of vacuum cleaner with
                    special devi- ce.</p>
                <p>Obtained results show that allergic mites are widely distributed among both as in
                    patients with bronchial asthma (67%) and in heathy people (33%). 13 species were
                    de- fined. Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus (Pyroglyphidae) and Glycyphagus
                    cadaverum (Gly cyphagidae) were most numerous. D.pteronyssinus was found only in
                    bedding dust, G.ca daverum occured in all things. The number of mites depended
                    on type and time of use of the mattress and pillows, In bedding made
                    individually and stuffed with with ani- mals wool the mites were found 3,4 times
                    more often than wadded mattrasses. In pil- lows stuffea with wool they are found
                    I,8 times more often than in pillows stuffed with feathers. Observations show
                    that in beddings that were used more thah I0 years the mites were met in 93
                    cases out. of I00 and in beddings that were used less than 10 the mites were met
                    in 4I cases out of 100. Maximum of mite numbers was in spring (march-april) and
                    in autumn (october-november) periods. This coincides with aggrava- tion of
                    allergic patients health in our region. During hot summer months in flat the
                    mites were not found. In highlands the alive mites were abundant in simmer, that
                    may be connecte with temperate climate this region.</p>
                <p>Investigation of ecological and faunistic nature of hause dust mites in every
                    con- crete zone is important and necessary for prognosis of seasonal changes in

                    infection and greater efforts need to mix it with the anticoagulants. (Ogungbade
                    personal observations). To evaluate the immune status of the infected animal as
                    compared with the uninfected control ones, the numbers of the white blood cells
                    (wbc) were investigated. Leucopenia was found in all the infected rats as
                    compared with the control ones. Further assessment to know the genesis of the
                    leucopenia in rats in the form of differential wbc count in infected and control
                    animals when canpared, reveaed increase in the number of neutrophils
                    (Neutrocytophilia), and Monocytis, an increase in the number of the monocytes in
                    the blood of the infected animal as canpared with the control animals and
                    lymphopenia in the infected rat. It is speculated that increase in the number of
                    phagocytic cells particularly monocytes and neutrophils might be associated with
                    the activities of the host defence mechanisms to actively engulf the
                    trypanosomes in the blood and or antigenic processing by the macrophages or as a
                    result of antigenic variations in the severals waves of parasitaemias. Decrease
                    in the number of lymphocytes in infected rat might be associated with
                    immunodèpression. Estimation of the plasma protein revealed a dramatic increase
                    in the infected animals as compared with the controls. It is speculated that
                    increase in plasma protein might be associated with antigenic variation. This
                    needs further assessment particularly assessment of the immnoflobulin

                <p>Depuis 1958, la souris est utilisée comme animal d'expérimentation pour estimer
                    le pouvoir pathogène des amibes libres, isolées chez l'homme et dans la
                    nature.</p>
                <p>Entre 1984 et 1989, un nombre considérable de souches d'amibes libres a été isolé
                    dans l'eau en Galice ( Espagne ). Les auteurs ont réalisé une étude du pouvoir
                    pathogène des 65 souhes poussant à 37°C : 43 du genre Acanthamoeba et 22 du
                    genre Naegleria.</p>
                <p>Pour chaque souche, 7 souris albines CD 1 ont été inoculées par voie
                    intra-cérébrale et 7 autres par voie intra-nasale. Les souches pathogènes,
                    induisent la mort de 4 souris au moins et les cultures d'organes sont positives.
                    Les souches modérément patho- gènes, n'induisent pas la mort de 4 souris, mais
                    les cultures d'organes sont positives pour au moins 4 d'entre elles.</p>
                <p>Parmi les 22 souhes de Naegleria testées, une seule a été classée comme pathogène
                    et une autre comme modérément pathogène. Par contre, parmi les 43 souches
                    d'Acanthamoeba testées, 12 ont été classées dans le premier groupe et 21 dans le
                    second.</p>
                <p>Conclusion : Dans la nature, le genre Acanthamoeba semble présenter un risque

                    immunehistochemical,skin connective tissue Sevre skin changes, such as fibrosis
                    and atrophy, occur in some onchocer- ciasis patients. We have previously
                    reported filarial enzymes able of de- grading purified vertebrate connective
                    tissue components, as well as fi- larial collagen-like molecules. In addition,
                    up to 62% Yanomami onchocer - ciasis patients from Parima showed high levels of
                    specific antibodies to some vertebrate basement membrane components and to
                    filarial collagen-like molecules. However, the significance of such findings to
                    the host-parasite relationship in onchocerciasis is still unknown. The
                    objectives of this study were to analyze the distribution of particular filarial
                    antigens in skin biopsies of Vanomami onchocerciasis patients using purified
                    antibodies to the different components mentioned above. The methods used were
                    immuno- histochemical analysis of skin biopsies using purified antibodies
                    labeled with fluorescein: direct ELISA to estimate antibody levels in sera, and
                    di nical analysis of skin lesions. The patients were all adults and presented
                    mean microfilarial densities in skin from 0 to 110 microfilariae/mg. 81% of the
                    individuals had highly significant levels of antibodies to onchocer- cal
                    antigens (X=-0.88 OD) and the skin lesions studied were clinically de- fined as
                    chronic onchocercal dermatitis and atrophy. À significant correla- tion was
                    ‘found between circulating antibodies to the components mentioned above and the
                    microfilarial levels in skin. The analysis of skin biopsies indicated high
                    heterogeneity in the distribution of the filarial antigens studied in the skin,
                    as well as variable reactivity of the antibodies direc ted to basement membrane
                    components, depending on the individuals studied.</p>

                    determined the level of Acid Phasphatase (AP), mieloperoxydase (MPO), NAD- and
                    NADP-dehydrogenase, phospholipides (PL) in blood leucocytes, the activity of
                    superoxyddismutase (SOD), Katalase (K) in blood plasma, intensiveness of
                    peroxyde oxydation of lipides in plasmalemma of eryth- rocytes (POL2-E) and
                    mielopoesis in different types of vertebrate hosts - CBA mice, golden hamsters,
                    guinea-pigs and humans infected with pro- mastigotes of L. major, L. tropica, L.
                    donovani, L. braziliensis with different degree of virulence. The increase in AP
                    level, activity of SOD and K, and decrease in NAD- and NADP, inhibition of
                    POL2-E proce- sses as well as an inhibition of granulo and mielopoesis in bone
                    mar- row of vertebrate host were revealed. The degree of modulation depends on
                    the type of parasite, virulence of the strain and susceptibility of the host.
                    This allows us to make a conclusion that stabilization of cytoplamic membrane of
                    precursor-cells of haemopoesis is the leading pathogenic mechanism in
                    leishmanial infection.</p>

                <p>The spleens of the carp were histopathologically found to contain fresh and older
                    granulomata with regressive changes and with extinction of the fungal agent. In
                    the livers of trouts the dispersed inflammation was asso- ciated with the
                    biliary tract,were it took the form of lymphocytic infil- trates, in the area of
                    the portal fields the granulomata consisted of his- tiocytes and polynuclear
                    foreign body cells, forming the boundaries of the structure of the hyphae which
                    also occurred outside the granulomata in the spleen. In the kidney,the
                    granulomatous inflammation was accompanied by hyaline droplet degeneration. The
                    erythrogramme of the affected S.gairdneri, compared with that of the

                <p>For our experience we used 15 male dogs, 3 months old and about 5 kg. weight.
                    They were reared free of parasites and divided in an experimental group with 12
                    animals, administered with 30.000-35.000 T. spiralis encysted in rat muscles
                    larva, and a control group, non infected, with 3 animals. We used the GM-1 T.
                    spiralis strain, characterized according to the International Commission on
                    Trichinellosis recomendations. To establish serum parameters related to the
                    kidney activity we took blood samples the days
                    -15,0,2,5,8,11,14,16,22,27,33,47,58,66,77,82 and 90 p.a., and we euthanasied the
                    animals the days 8,20,27,45,60 and 90 p.a., in order to study the morphological
                    changes produced in the kidney. At the same time, we took urine samples by
                    catheterization during the larva migration phase, realising the urianalysis just
                    after collection.</p>
                <p>The analitic study show, only in the first days of the experience, a light
                    increase in the seric levels of urea and creatinine, followed by a decrease
                    during all experimental phase. At the same time we observed a reduction of the
                    plasmatic proteins and the ratio Ab/Gb. The urianalysis show presence of
                    eritrocytes, leucocytes and proteins in most of infected animals. This
                    observations have been corroborated by the histopathological findings, which
                    evidence a loss of kidney filtration capacity.</p>
                <p>So, we observe a mesangial glomerulonephritis and tubulonephrosis, with presence
                    of hyaline and cellular cylinders in tubular lumen. The electron microscopical
                    study Show a cellular degeneration in the tubular system, with lymphocytic and

                    RATS TO INFECTION WITH TRYPANOSOMA B BRUCEI J.O. SIMAREN,O.W. ONASANYA, DEPT. OF

                <p>PATHOBIOLOGY AFRICAN TRYPANOSOMIASIS Deleterious effects haye been reported in
                    alcoholic patients and lab- boratory animals subjected to infections (Tisman and
                    Herbart 1973, Larsh 1947). No known reported studies on alcohol in trypanosome
                    infection of experimental animals. In a study, separate rat experiments were fed
                    daily with Ilmil dose of 45%, 35% and 25% ethanol for 21 days before infection
                    with the same standard dose of T. b. brucei. Our results show that T. b.brucei
                    infection in rats produced anaemia, but the 45%, 35% and 25% alcohols fed to the
                    rats seem to produce no comparative significant changes in total serum proteïn,
                    albumin and globulin, body weight and the development .of anemia in rats during
                    the infection. The 45% and 35% alcohols tend to in- hibit microphage production
                    and function, tbe de immunocompetence and inhibit leucocyte formation and caused
                    high level of parasitemia. The 25% alcohol tends to promote macrophage
                    production and function, enhance immu- nocompetence and promote leucocyte
                    formation, and caused low level of para- sitemia during the infection. The
                    results indicate that the high 45% and 35% alcohols have suppressed immune
                    response and resistance to infection whereas the low 25% alcohol has enhanced
                    immune response and resistance to infection in the alcoholic infected rats.
                    Chromatography analysis of liver extracts from the 45% alcoholic infected rats
                    revealed fever essential and free amino acids than that from the 25% alcoholic
                    infected rats. These informative results are useful in pathology of African
                    trypanosomes in man.</p>

                    BILIARY HYPERPLASIA P.C. Stewart, J.S. McCullough, L. Fairweather* and K.E.

                <p>Biliary hyperplasia; Anthelmintic; Fasciola hepatica; Rat Itis well known that
                    Fasciola hepatica induces a hyperplasia of the bile duct epithelium and stroma
                    during early stages of an infection. However, the effect on this hyperplasia of
                    terminating the infection with an anthelmintic has not been determined.</p>
                <p>Male Sprague Dawley rats (n=24) were allocated to one of four groups: control,
                    infected only, infected+anthelmintic or anthelmintic only. Animals to be
                    infected were each given 30 metacercariae by intragastric tube. Three weeks
                    post-infection, the infected only group was killed and the bile ducts
                    removed.</p>
                <p>The other infected group was dosed with the anthelmintic, Closantel (10mg/kg),
                    and sampled five weeks later. Rats in the fourth group were dosed with Closantel
                    without previously being infected and assessed after five weeks. AIl treated
                    animals were found to be devoid of flukes at autopsy. Tissues were prepared for
                    resin histology and transmission electron microscopy.</p>
                <p>Examination of the epithelium in whole circumference sections of bile duct
                    indicated that it had become highly disorganised and hyperplastic in infected
                    rats. There was an approximate doubling of the number of epithelial cells and an
                    interesting aspect to this was the disproportionate increase in the number of
                    tuft cells.</p>
                <p>Following anthelmintic treatment, the number of epithelial cells returned to
                    control values and the epithelium assumed its normal appearance. Area
                    measurements of sections revealed that ducts of infected animals had become
                    larger in terms of epithelium and connective tissue. However, although
                    epithelial area reverted to control values following anthelmintic treatment,
                    connective tissue values remained elevated. Furthermore, in anthelmintic-treated
                    control animals, the amount of collagenous connective tissue was significantly
                    increased, suggesting that Closantel may be hepatotoxic.</p>
                <p>It is evident that the presence of F. hepatica is essential, not only to the
                    induction of biliary hyperplasia but also to its maintenance, as its removal
                    will bring about regression of the pathology, especially at this early stage of
                    infection. Moreover, anthelmintic treatment itself may contribute to host
                    pathology.</p>

                    on day 1, and specific immuno-inflammation at day 5. The acute phase consisted
                    of bronchopneumonic foci of variable size, composed of dense accumulations of
                    PMN cells. The latter phase was mainly foci of mononuclear infil- tration,
                    especially lymphocytes and plasma cells with early fibrosis. No vasculitis was
                    evident in either reaction. Control animals receiving antigen with normal serum
                    had little or no evidence of lung injury.</p>

                    cattle and Syngamus trachea from trachea of domestic fowl was studied. The
                    content of glycogen, incorporation of D-(U- ‘C) glucose and the enzyme activity
                    of the glycogen synthesis in males and females of these nematodes were examined
                    by biochemical methods. D. viviparus females contained three- -times more of
                    glycogen (164.75 mg/g protein) than males or paired S.</p>
                <p>trachea. D. viviparus males incorporated only a half-amount (34.72 pmol/g wet
                    weight) of glucose when compared with females, but as much as 10-fold more than
                    S. trachea. Also the activity of glycogensynthase
                    (UDP-glucose:glycogen-©&lt;-4-glucosyltransferase, EC 2.4.1.11) correspon- ded
                    with the intensity of incorporation. The enzyme activity in males (2.125 nkat/g
                    glycogen) was 10-times higher than in S. trachea. The gly- cogen content and
                    intensity of the glucose incorporation depended on sex, Species and localization
                    of the helminth parasitation. The diffe- rences found in the metabolism of
                    saccharides reflect the influence of different parasitation environment and a
                    way of nutrition of the lung nematodes studies.</p>

                <p>cerebral malaria, gametocytes, ANKA clones It has been suggested that the
                    remarkable incidence of cerebral malaria, during the first 2 months of the rainy
                    season in sub-sahara Africa, is due to an increased sporo- zoite burden at this
                    time.</p>
                <p>An alternative explanation may be that a particularly path ogenic and seasonal
                    form of the parasite induces such severe pathology.</p>
                <p>In mice susceptible to cerebral malaria, we have found evidence for pathogenic
                    var- iations between clones of the ANKA strain.</p>
                <p>Thus clone 2.34 causes consistent death in 90% of infected C57BL/6 mice, within 9
                    days of intraperitoneal injection of 106 para- sites.</p>
                <p>Clone 2.33 induces cerebral malaria in only 60% of infected mice, with a slightly
                    prolonged survival time (1 day); the remaiïning 40% die only after prolonged
                    high parasitemia and anemia at about 3 weeks.</p>
                <p>asexual while clone 2.34 was selected for its high proportion of gametocytes.</p>
                <p>It seems intriguing that clone 2.33 is We have also observed that pre-exposure to
                    Complete Freund's Adjuvant completely abrogates the onset of cerebral malaria
                    after sporozoite innoculation; this effect is not due to elimination of
                    functional gametocytes, as shown by normal transmission to oocysts.</p>
                <p>It is noteworthy, however, that mortality curves for C57BL/6 mice are
                    superimposible on the gametocyte-oocyst transmission curve in mice (BALB/c) not
                    susceptible to cerebral malaria.</p>
                <p>In further experiments, enrichment of gametocytes and comparative innoculation
                    with asexual forms, followed by D-galactosamine, might illuminate the Tumour
                    Necrosis Facto inductive capacity of each form.</p>
                <p>Alternatively, immunisation with gametocyte antigen and specific elimination of
                    gametocytes might help to define the role played by the sexual forms or their
                    products in this immunopathology.</p>

                    hosts-Setariosis In order to confirm the pathogenicity of Setaria
                    Labiatopapillosa in unnatural hosts, infective larvae of the worm, which were
                    collected from Aedes togoi having sucked the microfilaria infested mice, were
                    inoculated subcutaneously into 43 Kunming mice (15-200 larvae each), 3
                    lambs(200-300 larvae each ) and 4 foals (750-1250 larvae each). 16/43 mice
                    showed incoordination and paralysis of limbs 1-8 days after inoculation,
                    followed by coma and death. Prominant eosinophilia was observed in the foals.
                    A11 the inoculated lambs and foals showed mild incoordination of hind limbs 5-21
                    days after inoculation and were necropsied 40-140 days later. Lesions found in
                    the central nervous systems of all the infested animals are parasitic
                    hemorrhagic malacia and non-suppurative encephalomyelitis. Sections of immature
                    Setaria were found in the foci of malacia of 1 mouse, 1 lamb and 1 foal. The
                    pathological changes are similar to those caused by Setaria digitata but it
                    seemed that Setaria digitata is rather pathogenic than Setaria labiatopapillosa.
                    Above result first demonstrated that ïinfective larvae of Setaria
                    labiatopapillosa can experimentally induce cerebrospinal setariosis in mice,

                    selected onchocerciasis patients in Ecuador and Guatemala participating in a
                    clinical trial with amocarzine (OGP 6140). Prior to the punch biopsy skin snips
                    had been taken before therapy (day 0) and on day 4 following start of therapy.
                    Biopsies were taken on day 5 following start of therapy which consisted of 3
                    mg/kg postprandially twice daily for 3 consecutive days. The punch biopsy was
                    taken within 1 cn from the snip site on the iliac crest. The mean microfilarial
                    skin density in this treatment group (312 pa- tients) had been reduced by 45 %
                    on day 4 and 95 % by day 8. The biopsies were im mediately fixed in
                    glutaraldehyde and halved after half an hour and left for 24 hours.</p>

                <p>Histopathologic examination showed that many of the microfilariae ( = MIF) in the

                    to determine the HLA antigen characteristics of infected and cardiopaths. From
                    4.307 rural inhabitants of the I to VI political regions, chagasic endemic area,
                    infection was demonstrated in 1.371 (31.8%) by two or more of the following
                    serological tests: indirectihemmagglutination, complement fixation, ELISA, doble
                    diffusion, counterelectrophoresis and immunoelectrophoresis. 30% of this group
                    had cardiopathy diagnosed by clinical study and ECG. The follow up of 198 cha
                    gasic cardiopaths and 216 non chagasic cardiopaths revealed after four years 7%
                    of morta- lity in the first group and 2% in the control greup. Only 10.8% of the
                    chagasic cardiopa ths presented symptomatology. From 106 strains of T.cruzi

                    leishmaniasis - Cytokines - TNF Serum levels of tumor necrosis factor
                    alpha/cachectin (TNF) were determined (IRMA - Medgenix - Bel- gium) in 58
                    patients with visceral leishmaniasis (VL). Twenty-four out of 28 patients with
                    acute VL before treatment had serum TNF of 143 + 114-pg/ml of serum (range from
                    negative to 450 pg/ml), far above normal control values (n = 15) from the same
                    area (11 + 16 pg/ml ; range 0 to 50 pg/ml). Twenty-one patients res- ponded
                    effectively to treatment (cured), 5 were refractory to therapy and 2 had
                    relapses. Pretreatment TNF levels were higher in the refractory group (276 + 69
                    pg/ml) than in responsive cases (129 + 112 pg/ ml).</p>
                <p>However, a single determination cannot be used as a predictor or therapeutic
                    prognosis ; TNF values in the res- ponsive group ranged from 0 to 450 pg/ml, and
                    from 125 to 359 pg/mIl in the refractory group. After treatment, TNF values
                    dropped to normal in cured patients (9 + 13 pg/ml) but remained elevated in
                    refractory cases (155 + 71 pg/mIl). Decrease in serum TNF levels was observed
                    earlier than clearcut clinical improvement (spleen size, WBC count, Hb) in the
                    group of cured patients. Two patients had an initial drop in TNF values
                    returning to high levels at time of relapse. Thirthy patients with cryptic VL
                    infection (16 asymp-tomatic, 4 self-healing sub- clinical and 10 post-VL
                    patients) had also their serum TNF levels evaluated ; 24 had normal levels, 3
                    had values between 30 and 50 pg/ml and one had 117 pg/ml. None of 10 patients
                    with cutaneous leishmaniasis had detec- table serum TNF levels. Our results show
                    that serum TNF level is a valuable indicator of disease in VL, and a sensitive
                    parameter for evaluating the effect of treatment.</p>

                    Hepatosplenic bilharziasis is common is some tropical countries. If ne- glected,
                    the disease followsits course until portal hypertension. At this stage, medical
                    and surgical management are necessary, and vary according to the extent of
                    portal hypertension. Three cases of joung adults ( res- pectively 18, 26 and 29
                    years old) complained of gastro-intestinal bleeding due to Schistosoma mansoni
                    infection. After emergency compres- sion with a Blackmore catheter, followed by

                    Hydatid cyst - Thymus Most of hydatid diseases develop in the liver or in the
                    lung. Neverthe- less, somme are in an uncommun position. A young algerian girl ,
                    15 years old , was operated one year before, of pulmonary hydatid cyst. The next
                    year, a check up because of influenza , showed a round and homogeneous opacity
                    in right lung. Diagnosis was tumor mediastinum. The excision showed that it was
                    an hydatid cyst in thymus. The study of our case ( and a review of 8 cases
                    already published) reveals some clinical am thera- peutic features : young age ,
                    mediastinal localization,long clinical la- tence period, chance discovery of the
                    disease. The Erythrocyte Sedimentation Rate is elevated, but the blood count is
                    normal. Serodiagnosis is negati- ve. The diagnosis is not possible by usual
                    préoperative assessement. The localization of the cysts in the thymus is usually
                    demonstrated only by histological examination.</p>

                <p>Visceral Larva migrans are common diseases in children, and the diagnosis is
                    often difficult. So, hepatic echography is very useful. A boy ,8 years old,
                    without any medical or surgical trouble before, is admitted to hospi- tal for a
                    circoncision. So,in the systematic pre-operative check up, it was surprising to
                    notice an high blood eosinophilia : 53%, with 19.000 white blood cells ( i.e.
                    10.700/mm$ }). A small hepatomegaly is observed at the physical examination, and
                    general state is good.Repeated stools examination show only Giardia
                    intestinalis. All the parasitological serodiagnosis are negative, except Larva
                    migrans. Hepatic echography shows several filling defects (from 7 to 11 cm
                    diameter).After two treatments with thiabenzadol (800 mg/d/ days) ,separated
                    from 15 days, the blood oesinophilia decreased; and after 20 months, the filling
                    de- fects disappeared on hepatic echography.So hepatic echography , is very
                    useful in diagnosis and medical surveillance of visceral Larva migrans.</p>

                    carried out on the incidence and clinical manifestations of parasitization by
                    Cryptosporidium spp. over a two years period (1987-1988) in 2101 fecal samples
                    from 1793 patients. Of these 1335 were children whose faeces were sent for
                    parasitological study to the Department of Microbiology and Parasitology at the
                    University Hospital in Salamanca. Samples were studied by the Ritchie technique
                    and a modified Ziehl-Neelsen acid-fast stain. Positive cases were confirmed by a
                    commercial indirect immunofluorescence assay with monoclonal antibodies
                    (Merifluor Cryptosporidium, Meridian, USA) that permitted quantification of
                    oocysts excretion.</p>
                <p>Twenty-seven cases of parasitization by Cryptosporidium spp (1.5% of the
                    patients) were detected, 19 were children (1.4%) and 8 were adults (2.2%). The
                    incidence in patients with anti-HIV antibodies was 12.5%, compared with 1.25% in
                    the group without anti-HIV antibodies (p&lt; 0.001). Of the cases of
                    parasitization, 55.5% were observed in children less than 4 years old (15
                    cases). The highest incidence was seen in winter and spring. In 14.8% of the
                    cases, parasitization by Cryptosporidium spp was associated with the presence of
                    other enteropathogens.</p>
                <p>The clinical picture of 25 cases was studied (children: 17 immunocompetent, 1
                    haemophiliac with AIDS; adults: 3 immunocompetent and 4 immunodepressed, 3 of
                    them with AIDS). Diarrhoea and abdominal pain were the most common clinical
                    manifestations in children (12/18, 66.6% and 10/18, 55.5%, respectively), in
                    immunocompetent adults (the three cases) and immunodepressed adults (two cases
                    with AIDS). In the latter, the duration of the diarrhoea was longer (interval,
                    90-120 days) and the frequency of stoo! deposition decreased with oral
                    administration of spiramycin at a dose of 3 g/day, although it did not
                    completely disappear. The picture was self- limiting in the children and the
                    immunocompetent adults. Two of the children and two of the immunodepressed
                    adults displayed asymptomatic excretion of oocysts.</p>
                <p>Of the 17 cases with diarrhoea, 14 exhibited an elevated excretion of oocysts in
                    faeces (82.3%). By contrast, of 8 cases without diarrhoea none presented an
                    elevated excretion of oocysts in faeces. In the light of these findings, during
                    1989 search was only made for the protozoan in 187 fecal samples from 174
                    patients with diarrhoea and/or abdominal pain. Three new cases were detected
                    (1.7% for this group); these corresponded to two adults and one child, all with
                    anti-HIV antibodies.</p>
                <p>The self-limiting nature of the clinical picture in immunocompetent individuals
                    and the chronic diarrhoea in AIDS patients, the existence of cases of
                    asymptomatic oocyst excretion and the relationship between elevated fecal oocyst
                    excretion and the presence of diarrhoea are discussed.</p>

                <p>OBJECTIVE : To assess child mortality from cerebral malaria (CM) in Brazzaville
                    from 1983 to 1989, according to age and district.</p>
                <p>METHODS : (a) Data were collected in paediatric wards of the four hospitals in
                    Brazzaville. For 1983 to 1987 the registers were analysed (retrospective study).
                    For 1988-89 detailed individual records were made for cases of CM (prospective
                    study) and completed by a retrospective analysis which involved comparison with
                    the registers. (b) Estimation of the population aged between 0 and 15 years, by
                    district, according to the official 1984 census and data on demographic growth
                    (5% per year).</p>
                <p>RESULTS : (1) Trend in number of children hospitalized (CH), number of children
                    hospitalized for malaria (CHM), number of children hospitalized for CM (CHCM),
                    number of deaths among children hospitalised for CM (DCHCM). For 1989 the figure
                    represent an estimate according to the data of the first 6 months.</p>

                    Onchocerca, Skin Nodule, Histololgy Skin nodules of Onchocerca gibsont and
                    O.volvulus were examined both histologically and histochemically. The
                    distribution of fibrous tissue, mast cells, eosinophils and the so-called ‘giant
                    cells' was investigated. The results show that in both types of nodules there is
                    an outer ring of fibrous tissue. Inflammatory foci were seen throughout the
                    nodules of O.volvulus whereas in the nodules of U.gtbsont they were much reduced
                    and restricted. Alkaline phosphatase was found in the regions adjacent to the
                    worms. The distribution of PAS was also examined. In both types of nodules
                    tracts of multinucleate cells were observed near to or attached to the worms.
                    The question of whether or not the "multinucleate cells' are giant cells will be
                    discussed.</p>

                    lors d'une rougeole dans le nord de son pays natal. L'enfant arrive en France en
                    Juillet 1986.</p>
                <p>Dès son arrivée il présente une polyadénopathie fébrile. Par la suite, plusieurs
                    poussées se succèdent, accompagnées d'une splénomégalie, d'une anémie
                    microcytaire hyposidérémique, d'une hypergammaglobulinémie avec prépondérance
                    des IgG et moindre des IgM.</p>
                <p>Devant ce tableau, les diagnostics suivants ont été successivement évoqués :
                    sida, tuber- culose, mononucléose infectieuse, rubéole, infections à mycoplasme,
                    Chlamydiae, cytomé- galovirus et virus Epstein Barr. Tous les examens pratiqués

                    Epstein Barr.</p>
                <p>Lors d'une nouvelle poussée en Mai 1988, l'enfant est réhospitalisé. Il présente,

                    Difluorométhylornithine (DFMO) est alors insti- tué en 2 cures de 6 semaines :
                    (400 mg/Kg/j, puis 800 mg/Kg/j du fait de l'échec de la première cure).
                    Parallèlement sont effectués un dosage de DFMO ainsi qu'un suivi de l'évolution

                <p>Leishmaniosis is yet a considerable problem in Iberian Peninsula. We present 4
                    cases OT Leishmaniosis which happen in our hospital between 1986-89 with stage
                    IV for infection. All patients were young (X= 28 years old), heterosexual and
                    ADVP. They were admitted by high fever without focus, profuse sweat and an
                    important weight loss (X=16Kg.) for several weeks. In the exploration: severe
                    malnutrion, ligth hepatosple- nomegaly (1-3 cm). In the analytic dates: moderate
                    anemia (4), lymphopenia, Leishmania serology (-). The diagnosis was done using
                    parasite visualitation in bone marrow (4).</p>
                <p>The treatment was done with Meglumine antimoniate (Glucantime) intramuscularly in
                    a single daily dose of 10 ml. (850 mg/day of antimony), in cycles of 20 days.
                    There was a good response to treatment with remission in the first week.</p>
                <p>SUMMARY: 1.- It must be included visceral Leishmaniosis in the large list of
                    parasitic desease associated with HIV + patients. 2.- Emphasize the absence of
                    anteriorly refe- red great visceromegalies. 3.-The direct visualitation of
                    parasites in bony marrow is the basic diagnostic method. 4.- Effective response

                <p>Determinants of birth weight, Malaria, Multivariate analysis Clinical
                    manifestations related to malaria during pregnancy are relatively rare in
                    tropical Africa.</p>
                <p>Besides, mean birth weights are lower among new born children when placenta is
                    infected and placental malaria is considered as one of the major factors
                    responsible for low birth weight (LBW).</p>
                <p>800 women were followed during pregnancy in 1987 and 1988 in the city of Banfora
                    (Burkina Faso; West Africa). Data were analysed by a multivariate analysis
                    taking into account other factors that might cause LBW.</p>
                <p>2 models were tested : a multiple linear regression (dependent variable : birth
                    weight) and a logistic regression (dependent variable : hypotrophy i.e. birth
                    weight &gt; or &lt; 2500 g).</p>
                <p>Placental infection appears to be responsible far LBW, though its importance is
                    relatively small compared with other factors such as duration of gestation,
                    parity and nutritional status (measured by Quetelet's index) of the mother.
                    These results could explain the small increase in birth weight observed in
                    randomized trials of malarial prophylaxis.</p>

                <p>Malaria - Diagnosis - Clinical chemical tests.</p>
                <p>Some clinical chemical tests were performed in parasitologically positive malaria
                    cases. Serum cholesterol was below normal in all cases. ALAT (SGPT) was
                    significantly elevated in 2% cases. Serum sodium was reduced in 58'6@% cases.
                    Serum albumin - globulin ratio was altered in 41'6% cases. Proteinuria was
                    present in 38'% cases. Urinary d-xylose excretion was below normal (following
                    administration of:oral é-xylose) in all cases. A possible approach, when malaria
                    parasites are difficult to detect due to its sub microscopic level, may help in
                    certain cases in diagnosis of melaria indirectly.</p>

                    Plasmodium falciparum to chloroquine is a serious problem in malaria control.
                    Mefioquine, a quinoline antimalarial with a similar action as chloroquine, is
                    now increasingly used in the treatment of severe malaria. Apart from HPLC
                    techniques there are hardly any methods available to detect and determine
                    mefloquine in biological fluids. Mefloquine is extensively metabolized and only
                    1-2% of the dosis is excreted unail- tered into the urine. The concentrations of
                    mefloquine in the urine are to low for detection by simple colourimetric methods
                    as the Dil1-Glazko, Haskins or Saker-Salomons tests. We have developed ELISA
                    tests for the detection and determination of mefloquine in blood and urine,
                    based on the use of specific antibodies against mefloquine. Using the hybridoma
                    tech- nology monoclonal antibodies could be produced against a mefloquine-BSA
                    conjugate inwhich mefloquine was coupled at the piperidine nitrogen through a
                    succinyl linker to the protein.</p>
                <p>The monoclonal antibodies against mefloquine did not react with the major
                    metabolite of mefloquine, which is of great importance as the latter is present
                    in much higher concentra- tions in the blood than the parent drug. Using the

                <p>(Chlor)proguanil, (chlor)cycloguanil, ELISA With the increasing resistance of
                    Plasmodium falciparum for chloroquine there is a renewed interest in the use of
                    the biguanide antimalarials paludrin and lapudrin for use in chemo- prophylaxis
                    of malaria. There are indications that the metabolic conversion of proguanil and
                    chloproguanil into their active cyclo metabolites may show wide inter-individual
                    variation.</p>
                <p>In order to study this aspect we have developed ELISA tests for the detection and
                    determina- tion of (chlor)proguanil and (chlor)cycloguanil in urine. For the
                    production of antibodies against proguanil and cycioguanil suitable analogues of
                    these drugs, containing amino or carboxyl groups, have been coupled to BSA. The
                    structures of the proguanil and cycloguanil- protein conjugates were designed to
                    raise antibodies which would not only react with pro- guanil and cycloguanil but
                    also with chorproguanil and chiorcycloguanil. Using the hybridoma technology
                    monoclonal antibodies against proguanil and cycloguanil were produced. These
                    antibodies showed full cross-reactivity with chlorproguanil and
                    chlorcycloguanil. Some of the antibodies against proguanil showed high
                    reactivity with chlorhexidine, a widely used desinfectant with a structure
                    closely related to proguanil, whereas others did not show any cross-reactivity,
                    indicating the recognition of different epitopes by these monoclonal anti-
                    bodies. Using various types of ELISA tests the concentrations of proguanil and
                    cycloguanil could be measured in urine obtained from volunteers (N015), who had
                    taken single doses of 100 or 200 mg paludrin. With some volunteers hardly any
                    cycloguanil could be detected in the urine in the first six hours, whereas later
                    proguanil/cycloguanil ratios were found simi- lar to those seen in other
                    volunteers.</p>

                    study of the epidemiology of Opisthorchis viverrini and its clinical
                    manifestations in Northeast Thailand. The purpose was to examine the
                    relationships between egg output, worm burden and parasite-specific antibody
                    levels, and to determine which measurement is most useful in predicting who has
                    asymptomatic hepatobiliary disease. Egg counts (using a quantitative
                    formalin/ether technique) showed a close association with worm burden (estimated
                    by expulsion chemotherapy) (r=0.80). IgG levels (measured by ELISA) also
                    correlated significantly with both egg counts (r=0.61) and with worm burden (r=
                    046). This suggests that all three measurements provide reasonable assessments
                    of relative infection intensity.</p>
                <p>To examine these parameters in relation to disease status, a group 87 apparently
                    health adults were examined by ultrasonography based on their intensity of fluke
                    infection or eurrent mild hepatomegaly. From this group, 8 cases of early
                    cholangiocarcinoma and several cases of mild gall bladder disease, chronic
                    cholecystitis, cholelithiasis and parenchymal liver disease were detected.</p>
                <p>While a highly significant positive relationship was observed between severity of
                    biliary tract disease and egg counts(tau=0.32) and worm burden (tau=0.39},
                    parasite-specific IgG levels were the most strongly associated with biliary
                    tract abnormalities (tau=0.53). We conclude that ELISA combined with
                    ultrasonography can be used to detect hepatobiliary disease associated with the
                    liver fluke in endemic communities.</p>

                    of patients treated for schistosomiasis at Roslagstull hospital, Stockholm,
                    Sweden 1976-1986, was performed. The purpose was to evaluate other possible
                    criteria for diagnosis than previously used- the identification of eggs. 74
                    variables from the 182 patients incl serology were put in a register programme
                    and a statistical programme. 78 % were men. Mean age for men was 28 y(8-65) and
                    women 27y(8-56) respective- ly. 177 were infected in Africa. À majority had
                    grown up in endemic area. 79% had S. man- soni and 8% S. haematobium.137 had no
                    other parasites. 127 had no symptoms of schisto.</p>
                <p>Seven had enlargement of liver or spleen. Rectal snip was neededfor diagnosis of
                    intesti- nal schistosomiasis for 15 %. Almost 80 % had increased levels of serum
                    IgE while somewhat more than 50 % had eosinophilia. ELISA, using soluble egg
                    antigen, had a sensitivity of 95%. In early infections, antibodies against the
                    qut associated antigens (GAA) in frozen sections of adult worm using the
                    immurvwfluorescence technique were a sensitive marker while increased antibody
                    titers against the somatic antigens were found in patients with a chronic
                    infection. CONCLUSION: patients with schistosomiasis in Sweden are often young
                    people without pathological findings in status. ELISA, using soluble egg
                    antigen, appears to be a sensitive and specific diagnostic method disregarding
                    the length of infection.</p>

                    splenomgaly, ascites and anaemia, Of these manifestations, diarrhoea, bloody
                    stools, paraumbilical pain, and haematemesis showed statistical evidence for
                    association, Among those aged 5 = 15 years, hepatomegaly was observed in 325
                    (82%) and splenomegaly in 388 (85%). There were, however, no statistically

                    initial laboratory findings typical of a benign self limiting viral meningitis.
                    In both cases the diagnosis of acute toxocariasis was only considered when
                    eosinophilia, peripheral in one and present in a CSF cytospin of the other case
                    was noted. Both cases made a complete and unremarkable recovery over a 2-3 week
                    period but both were given follow up therapy with diethylcarbamazine or
                    thiabendiazole as à safeguard. Therapy was tolerated well. Diagnosis was made
                    serologically. Both cases had raised IgG and IgE toxocara titres as measured by
                    ELISA using T canis excretory - secretory products as antigen, titres falling
                    significantly in convalescence. Both patients were blood group O and had
                    markedly raised IgG isohaemogglutinins anti A,, À, which also fell during
                    convalescence confirming cross reactivity of toxocara antigens with

                    suggests that this seemingly uncommon presentation of toxocariasis may in fact
                    be more common than suspected and can easily be diagnosed if Romanovsky stain is

                    alone gave a positive immunofluorescence or ELISA reaction with T. rangeli, they
                    failed to bind to parasite polypeptides by either immunoprecipitation or Western

                    IMMITIS) DISEASE R.A. Holmes, G.H. Turnwald. Department of Veterinary Clinical

                <p>Dirofilaria immitis, heartworm, radiology Thoracic radiography is a major tool in
                    the diagnosis of heartworm disease. The radiographie signs of the cardiovascular
                    changes seen with canine heartworm disease have been well described. Of those
                    publications reviewed, none took into account the systolic and diastolic
                    variation in the size and location of the main (MPA) and peripheral pulmonary
                    arteries, and also the cardiac shadow.</p>
                <p>Digital subtraction contrast angiography was done on 24 random source dogs.</p>
                <p>Systolic and diastolic diameter measurements were made on the maïn pulmonary
                    artery, the right cranial pulmonary artery, and the right and left caudal lobar
                    arteries. The changes in the location of the main pulmonary artery segment was
                    noted during systole and diastole. Eight of the dogs did not have any heartworms
                    present, and 16 dogs had from 1 to 171 worms present at necropsy.</p>
                <p>Results indicate that the published criteria for a radiographic diagnosis hold
                    true in moderate to advanced cases, but may result in false positive or false
                    negative diagnoses in dogs with minimal changes or are heartworm free. There was
                    a noticeable change in location and size of the main pulmonary artery segment
                    between systole and diastole. There was an average of 20% difference in the
                    diameter of the peripheral pulmonary arteries between systole and diastole. The
                    diameter changes could be seen on a real time playback of the angiograms.</p>
                <p>Overt cardiovascular changes due to heartworms are not difficult to recognize
                    radiographically. In cases where there may be minimal changes, recognition of
                    the stage of the cardiac cycle may be critical for a diagnosis. On plain films,
                    the shape of the heart is the only criteria to tell whether it was in systole or
                    diastole when the exposure was made. In systole, the heart is more irregular in
                    margination than when in diastole, where the margins tend to be more rounded.
                    Other subtleties of the radiographic diagnosis of heartworm disease will be
                    discussed.</p>

                    Cryptosporidium muris (strain RN66), isolated from the house rat, is highly
                    infective to adult mice, rats, and cats. It is easy to maintain the strain in
                    the laboratory and to obtain vast numbers of oocysts for experimental studies.
                    Diagnosis at present is based on detection of Cryptosporidium oocysts in feces.
                    The modified acid-fast stain is one of the most widely used methods, but,
                    sometimes misdiagnosis occurs due to the small size of oocysts (4-5 um) and the
                    existence of similar organisms in feces. We obtained a rabbit serum against
                    cryptosporidial oocysts by immunization using C. muris oocysts.</p>
                <p>In indirect immunofluorescence (IF) tests using this antiserum, intact and empty
                    oocysts, and excysted sporozoites of C. muris, C. parvum, and C. baileyi showed
                    bright fluorescence. Yeast-like organisms, oocysts of Isospora çanis and Eimeria
                    tenella, and cysts of Entamoeba histolytica and Giardia lamblia did not
                    fluoresce. The IF test using this highly sensitive and specific serum may be
                    useful for diagnosis of Cryptosporidium and epidemiological studies of
                    cryptosporidiosis in humans and animals.</p>

                    reagent strips - Quantitative urine analysis Urine analysis was performed in 684
                    Sudanese and Congolese schoolchil- dren with Schistosoma haematobium infection
                    as proven by a sensitive urine filtration technique. Semiquantitative assessment
                    was done with Combur®r test reagent strips (TRS) for proteinuria (PU),
                    erythrocyturia (EU) and leukocyturia (LU). Quantitative evaluation of EU and LU
                    was done with a Neubauer chamber within one hour after voiding of urine. PU was
                    determind with the Coomassieblue dye binding test in deep frozen specimens in
                    Germany. Out of 465 TRS positives for EU (&gt;10 cells per pl urine) 403 were
                    confirmed by microscopy (86,7%). The respective figures for LU and PU were
                    319/370 (86,2%) and 314/461 (68,1%). Falsely positive results in comparison with
                    quantitative techniques for EU were 189/208 (90,9%), 184/219 (84%) for LU and
                    172/210 (81,9%) for PU. The sensiti- vity and specificity of TRS as compared to
                    standard reference methods were as follows: EU 0,95 and 0,75, LU 0,81 and 0,81
                    as well as PU 0,90 and 0,56. When the results of all three test fields were
                    combined, TRS differentiated abnormal from normal urine specimens with a
                    sensitivity of 0,94 and a specificity of 0,70.</p>
                <p>It was concluüuded that a single test field of TRS is of limited value for the
                    detection of S. haematobium infection. Better results were ob- tained with a
                    combined score of all three parameters.</p>

                    affect) for vis- ceral leishmaniasis was given by us in 1I94I. According to our
                    data the primary affect appears to be a white pinky knot of a lentil size resem-
                    bling a pigmented spot covered with tender scale, In children up to one year of
                    age who have white tender skin the primary affect is observed comparatively more
                    often than in children who are over 2-3 years. Before the generalization process
                    while making blood count and the punctate of the bone marrow eosinophilia was
                    identified. After the generalization process eosinophilia changed by
                    eosinopenia. In visceral leishmaniasis erythropoiesis carries exclusively a
                    normoblastic character. While trea- ting the patients for visceral leishmaniasis

                    aliphatic range) and the concentrations of stilbene the compounds of aliphatic
                    range (the sodium antimonyl gluconate) seemed to be more effective. By using the
                    intensive doses of sodium antimonylgluconate (0.1-0.15 g/kg to the bulk of the
                    patient) it shortens the treatment time for 2-3 weeks and there's not to be
                    observed any an untreatable case and the lethality falls to zero.</p>

                    simultaneous and effective treatment of the joined severe diseases plays an
                    important part at the final outcome,. After having gone through a suf- ficient

                    suffering from repeated or ctronic bronchi and lung diseases anc undergoing
                    treatment in the Institute of Mother and Child in Rabka, Poland, have been
                    examined. 247 children have been found /with parasitological method/ to suffer
                    from Pneumocistis carinii infection, which constitutes 58% the examined
                    children. ese results have been compared with a group of 184 healthy children
                    /age 3-7/ from the local kindergarten. A statistically significant differences
                    between the two groups of children has been found. It has thus been decided that
                    all children hospitalized for chronic bronchi and lung diseases should be tested
                    for the presence of Pneumocystis carinii infection and treated accordingly
                    /Bactrim, Eusaprim/ if the cysts of trophozoites have been found.</p>

                    Immunofluorescence Detection of Giardia lamblia will confirm the clinical
                    diagnosis. The excretion of the G.lamblia is, however, intermittent and many
                    times sparce. Serological assays may therefore be valuable, when the parasite is
                    not detected, and the clinical diagnosis is in favour for giardiasis. To
                    evaluate the serology the antibody response has been determined during acute
                    giardiasis.</p>
                <p>Sera from 352 patients, who had been at risk of infection during a Giardia
                    outbreak in Sweden, were investigated together with sera from 200 healthy Swedes
                    for specific IgG antibodies in indirect immunofluorescence. /n vitro cultured
                    G.lamblia trophozoites were used as antigen. Stool specimens from all patients
                    were examined for Giardia cysts/trophozoites. Patients with proven giardiasis
                    were treated with nitroimidazoles.</p>
                <p>In stool-positive patients 60% were IgG positive and among the stool-negative 19%
                    were IgG-positive. (Sensibilitet 60% and specificity 81%). Only one stool
                    specimen had been examined in 50% of the seropositve but stool-negative
                    patients. In healthy Swedes 7% were IgG-positive with a low titre. To establish
                    whether the time between infection and blood sampling may have influenced the
                    outcome of the antibody detection, the material was divided into two groups,
                    early sera obtained within 3 weeks after infection and late sera obtained after
                    3 weeks of infection. A significant increase (p&lt;0.05) of IgG-positive
                    patients were observed in the stool-positive group, a difference not registered
                    among the stool-negatives.</p>
                <p>Sensibility and specificity obtained by early sera were 50% and 83%. The
                    corresponding figures among the late sera were 66% and 79%, respectively.</p>
                <p>The results suggest that: (i) primarily stool examination should be performed,
                    when suspecting G.lamblia infection; (ii) one negative stool-sample dont exclude
                    infection (iii) recommendation of serological analysis, when suspicion of
                    infection still remains, although the parasite has not been detected.</p>

                    en éviden- ce des caractéristiques nouvelles concernant la trichinose humaine
                    dans les communautés Inuit de l'Arctique Canadien. Ces résultats sont basés sur
                    une série cumulative de 89 cas provenant de 6 épidémies ayant eu lieu dans 3
                    localités.L'épidémie la plus récente est survenue à l'automne 1987 et concernait
                    40 individus ayant consommé de la viande de morse.</p>
                <p>Deux syndromes cliniques distincts ont été identifiés: la forme myopathique
                    (classique) ainsi qu'une forme se manifestant par une diarrhée persistante,
                    d'une durée moyenne de 44 jours et s'accompagnant de peu de symptôme musculaire.
                    Des différences significatives ont été observées entre les deux syndromes. Les
                    patients avec syndrome diarrhéique sont plus âgés et présentent des titres d'IgG
                    et d'IgM anti-trichinella plus élevés que les patients avec syndrome
                    myopathique. Les patients "myopathiques" ont un rapport IgM:IgG et une cré-
                    atinine phosphokinase plus élevés mais une albuminémie plus faible que les
                    patients avec syndrome diarrhéique. Le nouveau syndrome diarrhéique décrit
                    relève probablement d'une prémunité acquise chez les sujets plus âgés en raison
                    du caractère endémique de cette in- fection dans l'Arctique Canadien.</p>

                    migrans - Gnathostomiasis - Outbreak Gnathostomiasis in man is a disease caused
                    by the migration of larvae or young adults of Gnathostoma spinigerum through
                    various tissues producing mechanical injury and cellular reaction. The disease
                    is characterized systematically by eosinophilia and locally by a variety of
                    manifestations such as migratory swelling of the skin, meningo-encephalitis,
                    pneumonitis etc. Man contracts the infection by consuming uncooked or poorly
                    cooked freshwater fish, birds, frogs, snakes and other intermediate hosts
                    containing gnathostoma larvae.</p>
                <p>An outbreak of Gnathostoma larva migrans occurred among quests of a New Year's
                    party in Thailand. Nine people who consumed à raw fish dish called ‘Hu-Sae'
                    contracted the disease. Five of them developed gastro-intestinal symptoms
                    included nausea, vomiting, abdominal cramps or diarrhoea as early as within the
                    first 24 hours While the other four, symptoms started on the following day.
                    After the initial symptoms pertaining to the qgut, malaise, chest discomfort,
                    cough, myalgia, weakness, itching and migratory swelling were experienced.
                    Eosinophilia was demonstrated in every patient with a mean (+SE) count of
                    5516+1010 cells per cu. mm. Detection of antibody against ageous extracts of G.
                    spinigerum adult antigen using an enzyme- linked immunosorbent assay showed a
                    titre of 1:1600 or greater in every patient except one who had a titre of 1:400
                    (positive &gt;1:400) and diarrhoea for 3 days after ingestion of the infected
                    fish. This outbreak emphasizes the high attack rate when heavy infected fish are
                    consumed.</p>

                <p>Human Sporotrichosis is of rare occurrence in Iran.The first case was identified
                    in the Medical Mycology Laboratory,Schoo1 of Public Health,Tehran Medical
                    Sciences University in 1983.Since the diagnosis of the first case of
                    sporotrichosis up to 1989 six cases also have been diagnosed.Out of six patients
                    ,3 were male and 3 female.The age of the patients ranged from 24 to 60 yr.Only
                    one patient had the cutaneous Lymphatic form of infection,the others had the
                    localised cutaneous type.</p>
                <p>Most lesions were on the upper limb with ulcerative and verrucous forms.Out of
                    this 6 cases 3 cases were from tehran and 2 cases from the caspian
                    region.Sporothrix Schenckii was isolated from the soil samples collected from
                    the caspian area and Tehran by agar plating method,which the isolates were
                    pathogenie in animal inocula- tion too.</p>

                    sided pleural effussion, is reported. Iconography includes studies with magnetic
                    resonance imaging (MRI), a technique not described previously in diagnosis of
                    fascioliasis.</p>
                <p>À 29 years old woman, who had ingested savage water-cress, was admitted to the
                    hospital because of fever and right sided abdominal pain. Eosinophilia was noted
                    in a blood smear (6500/mm*). An x-ray film of the chest showed a right pleural
                    effusion, which contained 2600 cells/mm* (70% eosinophils). Imaging studies of
                    ultrasonography (US), computed tomography (CT) and MRI revealed a right pleural
                    effusion, ascites and sub-capsular and intra-parenchymal hepatic hematomas .
                    Moreover, MRI and CT showed a liver laceration beside a great subcapsular
                    hematoma. Diagnosis of fascioliasis was confirmed in serologic studies, by means
                    of indirect hemaglutination (title:1/2560), in both samples of blood and pleural
                    fluid.</p>

                    improvement. Subsequent imaging studies (US,CT,MRI) showed an important decrease
                    of pleural and liver anomalies, and the disappearance of ascites.</p>
                <p>_ P.+ S4.B 55 L CHRONIC STRONGYLOIDOSIS: AN UNDERESTIMATED PROBLEM P. Morera
                    &amp; Marta Conejo. School of Medicine, University of Costa Rica.</p>
                <p>Chronic strongyloidosis - Strongyloides stercoralis - Chronic eosinophilia
                    Several studies carried out using World War II veterans, demonstrated that
                    chronic in- fections caused by Strongyloides stercoralis can persist for more
                    than HO years. Al- though slight symptoms appear periodically, the finding of
                    larvae in the stools is very hard. Since the onset of the acute clinical iliness
                    depends upon the immnological sta- tus of the patient, the use of
                    immmnodeficiency-causing drugs can be quite hazardous.</p>
                <p>Thus, the use of a sensitive stool examination technique in suspected chronic
                    infec- tions is advisable.</p>
                <p>More than 1,000 sera from patients with eosinophilia and gastro-intestinal
                    symptoms are studied yearly in our laboratory; all of them are suspected of
                    having Angiostrongylus costaricensis infections; approximately one third of them
                    test positive. In the nega- tives, when Che stools are available, we recently
                    began to search for S. stercoralis larvae by the Baermann technique, using a
                    full teaspoon of feces. One to several larvae can be recovered after overnight
                    sedimentation. In all of the cases, no larve has been observed before, either by
                    direct examination or centrifugation-concentration methods.</p>
                <p>Up to 60 cases have been diagnosed. Albendazole, !H0O0Omg/day/5 days, repeated 2
                    weeks after the last dose, has proven to be very effective. In the tropics,
                    etiology-unknown eosinophilia is a quite common finding. Could many of these
                    cases be caused by chronic S. stercoralis infections?. It is a question to be
                    answered by using high sensitive techniques. Since disseminated acute
                    strongyloidosis is a life-threatening disease, the use of
                    immnodeficiency-causing drugs in patients with eosinophilia, should be done
                    after an exhausting search for S. stercoralis larvae.</p>

                    Morera &amp; Céspedes, 1971 (=Morerastrongylus costaricensis Chabaud, 1972), is
                    a human parasitic disease that apparently is widespread throughout the American
                    Continent, including several Caribbean Islands. In addition, a human
                    autochthonous case has been reported in Africa. Several species of rodents are
                    the natural definitve hosts; moreover, the coati-mundi and domestic dogs in
                    Costa Rica, and marmosets from the Peruvian Amazon basin, have been also found
                    naturally infected.</p>
                <p>In humans, as in the natural animal hosts, the adult parasites localize within
                    mesen- teric arteries of the ileo-cecal region, causing inflammatory reaction
                    and thrombosis- necrosis, that in several cases need surgical treatment. In
                    addition, ectopic localiza- tions in the liver and testicles have been observed.
                    Although adults can become infec- ted, most of the cases are observed in
                    children.</p>
                <p>In Costa Rica, where the disease was originally found, around 350 cases/year are
                    diag- nosed, giving an annual rate of 12 cases/100,000 inhabitants, which in our
                    opinion, is a problem of public health.</p>
                <p>In the past decade, we observed an augmentation of the infection rate, parallel
                    to the increase of the awareness of the medical personnel concerned with the
                    problem. As the knowledge of this parasitic disease increases, more cases are
                    being found in other Latin American countries, as could be the case in
                    Africa.</p>

                <p>We have previously reported that surface/stichosomal antigens of T. spiralis
                    muscle larvae purified by monoclonal antibody (MAb) NIM-MI are the major
                    components recognized during experimental infection of swine with this parasite.
                    To test the usefulness of -- purified surface/stichosomal antigens in the
                    detection of naturally infected swine, a cross-sectional epidemiological study
                    was carried out in Toluca, State of Mexico. This geographic area was previously
                    reported to be endemic for trichinellosis. In this study, serum as well as
                    muscular tissue samples were collected from 50 animals that wre taken to
                    slaugther houses. Control animals were free of detectable parasitic infections
                    as determine by fecal and ELISA examination. Serum samples were tested by an
                    stardardized ELISA assay using purified surface/stichosomal components
                    excretory-secretory antigens and total soluble parasite extracts from muscle
                    larvae. These sample were also assayed by Western blot analysis to determine
                    recognition of muscle larvae antigens. Muscle tissue from whole diaphragm and
                    tongue were digested in a solution of acid-pepsine to determine infection of
                    swine with T. spiralis. Our result showed that the use of puri- fied
                    surface/stichosomal and excretory-secretory antigens in ELISA allowed the
                    detection of infected animals with a high sensitivity as compared with the use
                    of whole soluble extracts. Animals that gave positive OD values in ELISA were
                    the only ones found to be infected with T. spiralis since parasites were
                    recovered from their collected muscle tissue. Western blot analysis showed that
                    components with MW of 105, 72, 67, 52, and 47 were mainly recognized by serum
                    samples from infected animals. Four of these were sim- ilar to
                    surface/stichosomal antigens recognized by MAb NIM-M1. These results suggest
                    that surface/stichosomal components are major antigens recognized during a
                    natural in- fection in ewine S4.B 59 P.</p>

                    method (Qu et al, 1983) was applied to investigate the molecular genetic basis
                    of trypanosomes which cause the trypanosomiasis of human and domestic animals in
                    developing countries.</p>
                <p>Several rapid divergent domains of 26S rRNA from Trypanosoma evansi and
                    monomorphic T. brucei (l.la) were completely sequenced. High homology in
                    nucleotide sequence from the two trypanosomes gave a molecular evidence for
                    their very close relationship, but some diferences were identified by
                    comparative analysis in a most rapid divergent domain.</p>
                <p>Oligonucleotide probes, based on the molecular diferences among trypa- nosomes,
                    other protozoa and mammal hosts, were constructed for the detection on the
                    trypanosomes. The test is a most sensitive and selective assey by using of
                    polymerase chain reaction (PCR) proceture and the species-specific probe.
                    ®Therefore it may have medical importance in diagnosis of trypanosomiasis and

                <p>Helminth control - Ascaris suum - Swine The prevalences of helminths in Danish
                    swine have decreased gradually during the last 20 years, especially in large
                    herds with intensive mana- gement and modern housing systems. In 1987 all
                    anthelmintic treatments were discontinued in 24 large sow herds. Ascaris suum
                    was found in very low numbers in 23 and Oesophagostomum sp. in 2 of these herds.
                    Since then, faecal samples from 25-30 kg pigs, large fatteners (appr. 90 kg),
                    dry sows and lactating sows have routinely been examined for helminth eggs.</p>
                <p>During the period up to now (25 year) marked increases in prevalence rates of
                    A.suum (to 30-50%) have been observed among the sows of 10 herds, half of which
                    then decided to use anthelmintics again. In the sows of the remaining 14 herds
                    A.suum still was found only at low levels if at all.</p>
                <p>Furthermore, no clear increases have been observed among the fatteners, where the
                    large majority of herds had extremely low prevalences of A.suum, or no helminths
                    at all. Surprisingly, in the youngest pigs no helminth infections have been
                    recorded, despite contamination of the farrowing pens with Ascaris eggs might
                    have taken place. Oesophagostomum sp. was still only recorded in the originally
                    infected herds in very low numbers.</p>
                <p>The results indicate that transmission of helminths in some large sow herds in
                    Denmark is negligible possibly due to environmental and manage- ment factors.
                    Therefore, in these herds coprological surveillance on the basis of which
                    eventual treatment may be suggested is a realistic alterna- tive to routine
                    prophylactic treatment without monitoring parasites.</p>

                    admitted in Paediatric Ward of M.S. Ramaiah Teaching Hospital, were screened for
                    Cryptosporidium species.</p>
                <p>The techniques used for staining were modified cold Kinyoun, safranin methylene

                    stool sample from four cases were positive for Cryptosporidium. À Zzoonotic
                    origin in these cases has to be speculated. Cryptosporidium species has been
                    recognised as a newer pathogen in cases of diarrhoea and can be diagnosed by
                    special staining techniques.</p>

                <p>À Preliminary survey was carried out in Northern and Central Rift Valley, Kenya
                    fol- lowing detection of unusual cases of cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL) thought
                    to be due to L.tropica from this region. Population samples were examined in
                    suspected areas as guided by information obtained from treatment centres in the
                    region. Several foci of CZ were detected in northern and central Rift Valley at
                    1,500 to 2,000m altitude. A detailed follow-up of cases was carried out in the
                    latter in order to elucidate key ecological and clinical features of the
                    disease. In the northern Rift Valley, in the Samburu and Laikipia districts CL
                    occurred in newly settled communities occupying pre- viouslÿ uninnabi ed
                    plateaus partly cleared of forest and bush. In the central Rift Valley district
                    of Nakuru and in the neighbouring Nyandarua district,central province, besides
                    affecting newly settled immigrants who were still on the process of clearing
                    their land the disease also occurred among charcoal burners in uninhabited
                    areas. The foci were characterized by cliffs and other rocky areas containing
                    caves harbouring mammals and plebotomine sandflies. Lesions occurred mainly in
                    the head region and tended to multiple with characteristic ulcers, plagues or
                    nodules. Self healing oc- curred after one ÿear in most cases, although lesions
                    of over 8 years duration were observed. In a group of charcoal burners which was
                    found to have a high prevalence rate of CL(50%) a high leishmanin skin
                    reactivity rate was recorded. The antigen used was an L.major strain
                    MHOM/IL/67/Jericho II,LRC-L137. This was 35.7% in active lesions,25% in people
                    with scars and 25% in apparently normal individuals. Parasites isolated are cur-

                    variability of S.haematobium egg excretion using a quantitative syringe
                    filtration technique and the variability of haematuria detected visually and by
                    reagent strips were studied in a population of 520 subjects from the village of
                    Pujini (Pemba Island, Zanzibar, Tanzania) for 6 consecutive days.</p>
                <p>Significant variability of egg excretion was found both in the whole population
                    and in the 5-19 year age group. Subjects with one urinary egg count of 50 eggs
                    or more per 10 mil of urine were not similarly classified in 36% to 61% of the
                    other 5 examinations and in fact 4% to 16% of their other examinations were
                    negative.</p>
                <p>Gross haematuria had a specificity of almost 100% and was closely related to egg
                    counts greater than 50 eggs per 10 ml urine. Single daily high semiquantitative
                    recordings of haematuria, detected by reagent strips, were closely related to
                    the highest egg count of each subject. It was concluded that at the primary
                    health care level single highly positive semiquantitative values for haematuria
                    were a more useful diagnostic indicator than a single egg count to select people
                    with heavy infection for selective population chemotherapy.</p>

                <p>This study reviews the epidemiologic and clinical data of 451 subjects with
                    autochthonous infection diagnosed in our laboratory from Jan.1975 to Dec.1989.
                    The patients were predominantly males (338 cases; 74.9%) and adults with an age
                    range of 20-59 yrs (215; 47.7%) and 60 yrs (210; 46.6%), living and/or working
                    in rural areas (282; 62.5%). 56 (12.4%) subjects were institutionalized mntally
                    retarded patients. Infection was asymp tomatic and recognized by chance in 53
                    (11.74) cases, whereas patients with overt disease coplained of gastro
                    intestinal (70.64), respiratory (14.4%), and cutaneous (38.6%) symptoms.</p>
                <p>Eosinophil count ranged from 1 to 8%/mm in 122 (27.14) patients, from 9 to 20% in
                    213 (47.2), and 20% in 116 (25.7%). Pathologic or iatrogenic immunodeficiency
                    was shon in fifteen patients and three of these develo ped a fatal disseminated
                    infection. Thiabendazole was used as first choïîce drug in 383 patients. À
                    complete recovery with minor side-effects was observed in more than 85% of cases
                    with 50 mg/Kg every 48 hours for three times, wereas no response was seen in 12
                    gastrectomized subjects. Mebendazole and Albendazole in 28 and 10 patients
                    réspectively were no valid alterantive drugs. Recently we performed à nilot

                    sonomorphometry of liver and spleen. The clinical criterion for suspected
                    hepatomegaly was organ extension &gt; 3 cm below the costal margin in sternal

                    Although some cases have been reported from India, Malaysia and Vietnam,
                    Gnathostomiasis is commonest in Thailand. Man is infected by eating inadequately
                    processed or under- cooked fish, particulary of the species Ophicephalus
                    striatus, containing the third- stage larva of Gnathostoma spinigerum which is
                    not fully adapted to man an in whom it migrates throuh tissues. Punyagupta,
                    Vejjajiva and Boongird et al defined the neurologi- cal spectrum of signs and
                    symptoms of Gnathostomiasis (G). Radiculomyelitis, transverse myelitis,
                    subarachnoid haemorrhage and, in rare instances, encephalitis represented the
                    predominant clinical syndroms.</p>
                <p>During the 6 year period - January 1980 through December 1985 - thirty nine
                    patients suf- fering from CNS Gnathostomiasis were admitted to the Division of
                    Neurology, Ramathibodi Hospital, Thailand. The diagnosis was established either
                    clinically, according to the critieria given by Boongird et al (1977) and - from
                    1984 on - confirmed serologically by means of Elisatechnique. Beside the
                    neurological signs and symptoms, described above, intracerebral haemorrhage and
                    transitory obstructive hydrocephalus could be observed.</p>
                <p>These two conditions were proved by computerized tomography of the brain (CT) and
                    the Elisa of these patients were highly suggestive for Gnathostomiasis.
                    Eosinophilic pleocy- tosis in the Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) supported strongly
                    the diagnosis. Thus it is sug- gested to enlarge the spectrum of signs and
                    symptoms of CNS Gnathostomiasis and to in- clude transitory hydrocephalus
                    occlusus and intracerebral haemorrhage into this spectrum.</p>

                    cervi disease in Taiwan and overcome the barrier of the languages the
                    pathological difference of two diseases became clear: the S.d. disease is caused
                    by an immature worm (1-2 cm) of the migratory stage, thus destroying the nervous
                    parenchym severely and deeply, while the S.c. disease by the mature adult worm,
                    mostly parasiting several in number, as à normal parasite in the normal host
                    (Shika), thus causing mostly the pressure atrophy at the periphery of the
                    nervous parenchym (as in the case of Parelaphostrongylosis) and therefore minor
                    nervous disturbances, sometimes unrecognized. Dubious taxonomic position of S.d.

                <p>Malaria, Quinine, Orthostatic hypotension We have investigated the relative
                    contributions of malaria itself and quinine treatment to orthostatic hypotension
                    in 17 patients (8 males, 9 females; aged 17-72 years) with uncomplicated P.
                    falciparum infections. Blood pressure and pulse were recorded before and for
                    five minutes after standing on four occasions: immediately before and four hours
                    after quininine 10 mg/kg body weight by mouth, both in acute illness and in
                    convalescence. In acute illness, both systolic (SBP) and diastolic (DBP) blood
                    pressure feli on standing (mean + SD -21.4 + 14,5 and -10.7 + 11.2 mmHg) by
                    significantly more than in convalescence (-10.2 + 7.1 and + 4.0 + 7.0 mmHg
                    respectively, p &lt; 0.05). Quinine treatment accentuated the fall in SBP
                    standing in acute illness (-29.6 + 20.5 mmHg, p &lt; 0.05) but not in
                    convalescence (-12.4 + 7.3 mmHg, p &gt; 0.01). The changes in DBP after quinine
                    were similar to those before treatment in both acute and convalescent studies.
                    These data show that malaria is associated with orthostatic systelic and
                    diastolic hypotension. Quinine worsens systolic postural hypotension in acute
                    illness. Most patients failed to show adequate compensatory increase in heart
                    rate, even when postural hypotension was most marked in acute illness after
                    quinine treatment, suggesting that there are profound alterations in autonomic
                    function in falciparum malaria.</p>

                    Toxoplasma gondii - Toxoplasmose congénitale - Déficit immunitaire La
                    toxoplasmose congénitale est la conséquence d'une infection maternelle acquise
                    pendant la grossesse. Ce principe, sur lequel reposent en France les mesures de
                    prévention appliquées aux femmes enceintes, peut comporter des exceptions. 4 cas
                    d'infection congénitale ont été observés à la suite d'une toxoplasmose
                    maternelle antérieure à la conception : dans 3 cas, elle datait respectivement
                    de 3, 5 et 10 ans avant la grossesse et dans 1 cas, sa date était imprécise. 3
                    patientes présentaient une maladie auto-immune traitée par corticoïdes ( 2 lupus
                    érythémateux disséminés, 1 pancytopénie ) et la dernière patiente, traitée 3 ans
                    auparavant pour une maladie de Hodgkin, conservait un rapport T4/T8 abaissé.
                    Chez les 5 enfants (dont 2 jumeaux), on notait : une foetopathie sévère dès la
                    naissance, une toxoplasmose systémique aggravée secondairement, une cho -
                    riorétinite isolée et 2 infections asymptomatiques. L'étude sérologique
                    maternelle, d'une part, et les formes cliniques observées chez les en - fants,
                    d'autre part, suggèrent que la transmission de l'infection, conséquence d'une
                    parasitémie récurrente, est survenue au cours de la 2ème moitié de la grossesse.
                    L'existence d'une pathologie immunitaire chez une femme enceinte dont la
                    toxoplasmose est ancienne, comporte donc un risque de toxoplasmose congénitale,

                <p>Arboviruses - malaria- amazonia - symptons - treatment.</p>
                <p>The authors describe eight cases, in which infections of arboviruses and
                    parasites were observed in the same patient and at the same time, in the Amazon
                    region of Brazil. Seven of then were diagnosed by virus isolation and one, by
                    seroconversion, Plasmodiun falciparus (diagnosed by thick and thin smears) was
                    associated with the following arboviruses: Guaroa (California serogroup of
                    Bunyaviridae) 3 times; Tacaiuma (Anopheles À serogroup of Bunyaviridae) twice;
                    Catu (Guasa serogroup of Bunyaviridae) once. The latter patient was also
                    infected with P, vivax. Intestinal heïminths (Ascaris lusbricoides,
                    Trichocephalus trichiurus and Ancylostomidae sp) were present in faeces of a
                    vireaic patient with Guana (Guama serogroup of Bunyaviridae). One case of
                    toxoplasmosis (diagnosed by indirect imsunofluorescency antibody test) was
                    associated with Ilheus (B serogroup of Flaviviridae). This patient, a female of
                    35 years old, made a seroconversion for both. Infection with Toxoplasma gondii,
                    in this age group is rare, and represents in Brazil only 0.34 of the cases, Five
                    patients were male and three female. A1] were seventeen years old or more. 5
                    were agricultural workers, { was government official; { was a commercial
                    traveller and { was a domestic help. The main clinical history of disease was
                    fever with headache, chills, myalgia and arthralgia. Sometimes we noted
                    abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting and dizziness. Jaundice was recorded in two
                    cases of P. falciparum in association with Tacaiuma. Patients were treated by
                    SUCAN with chloroquine, primaquine, quinine, or other when necessary. Some of
                    them recovered quickly, but others, despite the above specific treatments,
                    continued with all their syaptons, until the completion of viral cycle. P.
                    falciparum was found more frequently in association with arboviruses than P.
                    vivax and T. gondii. This fact may be in relation with the greater rate of P.
                    falciparun, caused malaria in the Para State (SUCAM personnel comsunication).
                    These cases are iaportant because in Amazonia thousands of people are diagnosed
                    and treated for malaria. About 10% of the strains are considered to be drug
                    resistant, The possibility (probably much underestimated) of concomitant
                    infections with arboviruses may thus obscure the effectiveness of the treatment,
                    or may lead to false diagnosis. It is supposed that the joint infections with
                    malaria and Guaroa or Tacaiusa viruses were due to the fact that in Amazonia,
                    mosquitoes vectors may be in either cases Anopheles nuneztovari or An.
                    triannulatus, The other cases are considered merely incidental, because neither
                    Catu virus nor T. gondii have ever been isolated fro8 malaria vectors.</p>

                <p>Eosinophilia, Trichinellosis, B- Thromboglobulin We studied the possible
                    abnormalities in the coagulation of 8 patients with trichine- llosis and
                    eosinophilia( 500 cel/mm ) compared with 50 healthy control adults.</p>
                <p>Results, :Significative elevation was found in, the levels of: 1) Fibrinopen(
                    p&lt;0,001) 425 È 117mg/100m1 2)Platelet number (p&lt;0,005) 311+/- 94,7 x 10
                    /mm in front of 263+/-106x10 /mm . 3)b-Thromboglobulin(b-TG) (p &lt;0,001)
                    72+/-37 in front of 31+/-12.The platelet factor 4 levels (PF4) use to be
                    increased but it is not significative. There was no significant correlation
                    between the severity of eosinophilia and abnormalities in the coæulation test.
                    No patient presented thrombotic disorders.</p>
                <p>Summary: The elevated fibrinogen and platelet levels could be explaïned by their
                    acute phase reactants.The most important findings are the recount of PF4 and
                    b-TG which are indirect signs of platelet activation.</p>
                <p>The platelet hipereactivity is a constant factor in our patients and independent
                    of eosinophilia severity.</p>

                    Department of Pathology, Changchun Veterinary College, No.50 Fusong Road,
                    Changchun, Jilin 130012, The People's Republic of China Eye worm
                    disease-Horse-Setaria digitata The discription about the worm in the eye of
                    horse had been given in details in chinese classical publication "Yuan Heng Liao
                    Ma Ji" in 1608. So far few articles on the etiology of the disease have been
                    found. In recent years, our examinations on the materials from Liaoning,
                    Shandong, Fujian and Haïinan provinces of China indicated that the worms from
                    the eye of horses are all Setaria digitata larvae, which also is the pathogen of
                    the prodromal disease called arthroped born cerebrospinal setariosis of horse.
                    The result of the experimental reproduction of the disease showed that 3 Setaria
                    digitata larvae were found in the eye of 3 horses that had suffered from the eye
                    worm disease as well as cerebrospinal setariosis 2-3 months after inoculation.
                    Through our extensive studies, it can be concluded that Setaria digitata larvae
                    are the causal agent of the eye worm disease of horse in China. The prevention
                    and treatment of the disease should be empha- sized.</p>

                    drugs for therapy of intestinal hel- minthiases was studied. For treatment of
                    taeniarhynchiasis we used Phe- nasal and its combination with acrichin,
                    dichlorophen (dichlosal) and trichlorophen (trichlosal); For trichocephalosis -
                    Naphtamon, Naphtamon K, diphezyl, Tiabendasol and Vermox; for ascariasis -
                    Naphtamon, Naphta- mon K and Vermox; for hymenolepsiasis - Phenasal. 2073
                    patients were treated, out of which with: taeniarhychiasis-1241;
                    trichocephalosis-650; ascäriasis-122; hymenolepsiasis-60. The treatment was
                    dispansary. Phe- nasal was given in a single dose of 2,0 g; dichlosal and
                    trichlosal - 1,0 g; Naphtamon - for 5 days of 5.0 g. in one dose. Tiabendasol
                    and Vermox were given for 2 days. Phenasal was given for 6 days in a dose of 2,5

                <p>DRACUNCULIASIS, EFFICACY; SURGICAL EXTRACTION.</p>
                <p>The phase of worm protrusion in dracunculiasis is vital in the life cycle of the
                    parasite. Therefore any control model capable of breaking the host - vector link
                    at this point will hasten the eradication of the disease. A pilot study of this
                    hypothesis was carried out to provide information on the efficacy, reliability
                    and cost-effectiveness of surgical extraction as a control strategy. Surgical
                    extraction was performed on 9 patients in two categories A and B. While the two
                    groups presented with acute suppuration, group À had in addition discharging
                    sinuses and partly extruded guineaworm. Staphylococcus aureus and
                    Corynebacterium diphtheriae both sensitive to gentamicin and streptomycin were
                    commonly cultured from post operative wound swabs. Worm extraction was
                    relatively easy and fast in group À while it was difficult, time consuming and
                    unsuccessful in group B patients. Overhead surgical extraction cost was
                    USD.22.50. In conclusion surgical extraction (1) reduces duration of suffering
                    by patients (2) breaks host-vector link (3) is cost- effective and seems to
                    offer effective control.</p>

                <p>Dés 1980 à 1989, les auteurs ont diagnostiqué et traité 33 cas de paludisme,
                    desquels 24 (72,79) entre 1985 à 1989. Les patients:27 du sexe masculin et 6 du

                <p>L'agent étiologique a été le Pl.vivax dans 27 cas, le P1.falciparum dans 5 cas,
                    le deux dans 1 cas. Des gamétocites ont ëte vu dans 18 cas (14 vivax et 4

                    L.columella by regular treatment of sheep with triclabendazole.</p>
                <p>Donor sheep were grazed for four years. In year 1 and 4 no treatments were given;
                    in years 2 and 3 the sheep were treated with triclabendazole at 10 mg/kg every 8
                    weeks. In years 2 to 4 groups of 5 tracer sheep were grazed each for 6 weeks,
                    removed, slaughtered 12 weeks later and the flukes counted. Egg counts were
                    performed on donor sheep and snails were checked for infection 3 monthly. Large
                    numbers of flukes were recovered from tracer sheep in Year 1 and the first 3
                    months of Year 2. Negligible flukes were recovered until mid year 4, 8 months
                    after treatment ceased. Faccal egg counts of donors reflected a similar pattern.
                    Few snails were recovered during the study and only 1 L.tomentosa was found
                    infected in Year 1. Frequent treatments within the pre-patent périod of
                    F.hepatica for 2 years with an anthelmintic highly effective against early
                    immature and adult fluke drastically reduced infection in sheep but failed to
                    eradicate the parasite in an isolated area. However the buildup of infection was
                    slow after treatments were discontinued.</p>

                    détermine une atteinte généralisée des téguments et des phanères, des ions et
                    parfois même des viscères.Un terrain prédisposé génétiquément (consanguinité)

                <p>Taenia saginata - Hymenolepis nana - Praziquantel Infection by adult cestodes is
                    a widely spread disease in the world, and usually treated by niclosamide. But
                    this drug needs a complicated poso- logy. It was useful to try a new drug.55
                    patients complained of adult tapeworms infection : 40 with Taenia saginata
                    (adult from 20 to 60 years old) and 15 with Hymenolepis nana ( 14 children from
                    4 to 15 years old).</p>
                <p>Diagnosis was established on clinical ( 35 cases) or biological disturbances (9
                    cases of hypereosinophilia. In all cases , proglottids were found in stool
                    examination or in scotch-tape. Praziquantel was given in one oral single dose of
                    10 mg/kg for Taenia saginata and 20 mg/kg for Hymenolepis nana. À clinical and
                    biological surveillance was purchased during one month after treatment. All the
                    patients were cured by this treatment with negative controls ( stools and
                    scotch-tapes). No biological or cli- nical side effects was noticed. Our results
                    agree with some other stu- dies about Praziquantel in South-America, with 100%
                    suæess. So, this wide spectrum and easy to take antihelminthic drug seems to be
                    the best treatment, at the present time, of adult cestodes.</p>

                    Diethylearbamazine In infestation by Loa loa, several side effects, are common ,
                    due to mas- sive lysis, when treatment is started by diethycarbamazine. Major
                    dis- turbances can occur when microfilariaema reach 50.000/ml or more. So the
                    microfilariaema must be reduced before antifilarial treatment, forme- ly by
                    change transfusion. In this work, a new filtration with blood cell separator is
                    tested. 12 patients, from 22 to 61 years:old, infected with Loa loa were filtred
                    with an Haemonetics 30 blood processor, with 20 micron diameter
                    filters.Microfilarias are collected in the buffy coat and extrated.</p>
                <p>During 10 passages, between 11 a.m. and 3 p.m., 600 ml of blood are collec- ted
                    in FenwallT 600 bag. No side effects was noticed , except a temporary
                    thrombopenia. Decrease of microfilariaemia was 75% (55-70% by cytopheresis and
                    5-20% by filtration). This simple and not expensive technique is effi- cient,
                    and treatment by diethylcarbamazine can, after, be started, in slow progression
                    . Furthermore, the millions of microfilariae collected can be used as antigen
                    for immuno-logical tests.</p>

                    Kremlin-Bicêtre - France Leishmaniasis - Renal Transplantation Leishmaniasis is
                    common in North-Africa. In patients with transplanta- tions, taking
                    corticosteroid and immunosuppressive drugs, the appearance of the disease is
                    particular and the treatment is difficult. An adult ma- le patient, native from
                    Algeria, was admitted to hospital two years after a renal transplantation for
                    oscillating fever. Diagnosis of Kala-azar was based on bone marrow examination.
                    But the patient died two days af- ter. An adult female patient, native from
                    Algeria , is admitted to hospi- tal, 4 years after a renal transplantation, for
                    diffuse cutaneous infil- trated and erythematous popular plaques, and nodules (
                    head, arms, legs).</p>
                <p>Numerous amastigostes were found in the skin lesions and were identified as
                    Leishmania major:, MON 25 . A skin biopsy shows a dermic. dense infil- tration
                    with diffuse epithelioid cell reaction. The skin tests with Leis- hy:mania major
                    and Leish_ mania tropica were negative, but serodiagnosis is positive (1/640è
                    indirect Haemagglutination test). After four treatments with sodium
                    stibogluconate, the skin lesions resolved. But 6 months later the patient
                    complained of the same lesions. After 2 N. Glucamine and 1 Lomi- dine treatment,
                    the patient was not cured. Intensity and duration of this disease are due to
                    corticosteroid. But this drug cannot be stopped wit- hout a great danger of
                    rejection of graft. The solution only in such cases seems to be repeated
                    treatments during several years.</p>

                    compl#ite removed by surgery. From 1986 to 1989, 17 patients with AE were
                    transplanted in our center. 10 patients had a hilar involvement (group I), 7
                    patients had a parasitic Budd-Chiari syndrome (group II). The delay between
                    diagnosis and OLT was &gt;36 months in group Ia, &lt;24 months in group Ib and
                    &lt;48 months in group II. Previous operations were more common in group Ia than
                    in group Ib and II. 5 patients have died, 4 in group I and 1 in group II.
                    Actuarial survival rate (75% at 15 months) was lower than that observed in our
                    30 other transplanted patients (liver carcinoma excluded) (89% at 1 and 2
                    years). Reoperations were often performed in group Ia and II (69%). None of the
                    group Ib patients were reoperated.</p>
                <p>Bacterial and fungal infections occurred only in group IA (4 cases) and II (3
                    cases). In 7 patients there were residual foci of extrahepatic parasitic tissue.
                    The titer of specific antibodies (Ab) felt during the first 3 months in all the
                    patients. In patients with radical LT, disappearance of specific Ab occurred
                    within 2 years. In the other patients a peak of specific IgM occurred at 3
                    months, increase of specific IgG was observed later. The growth of residual
                    parasitic lesions seemed to be relatively slow and all the patients remained
                    asymptomatic with a mean follow-up of 19 months. However, immunosuppressive
                    treatment.</p>
                <p>may be responsible for a recurrence of the parasitic disease. an experimental
                    study is currently performed in order to evaluate this theoritical risk.</p>

                    The side effects were minimal but the impact on bone marrow must be closely
                    follow-uped because there was 207 reduction of polymorphonuclear leucocytes on

                    loa filariasis in the light of data collected in the Congo.</p>
                <p>METHODS : (a) Surveillance of accidents after Diethylcarbamazine (DEC)
                    administration in regions of high transmission. (b) Therapeutic trials with (1)
                    Mebendazole : 2 g/day for 21 days in 12 subjects (7 were controlled at
                    short-term, and 5 at medium or long-term), and (2) Ivermectine : 100 ug/kg in
                    one dose in 12 subjects (controlled at short-time). Microfilarial loads were
                    determined by reading 2 smears of 20 mm3 of capillary blood taken between 10h00
                    - 12h00.</p>
                <p>RESULTS : (a) Frequent adverse reactions were observed with DEC. There were
                    usually henign, but encephalitis was not exceptional in highly endemic regions,
                    even in hospitalised subjects in whom conventional precautions were taken (1 to
                    1.5% of the patients with high microfilaraemia). (b) Mebendazole was well
                    tolerated. Efficacy was low and variable at short-term, and slight or
                    non-existent at medium and long-term (recontamination was however a
                    possibility). Ivermectine was well tolerated and showed a clear microfilaricidal
                    effect up to day 7 but not afterwards.</p>
                <p>CONCLUSION : No true progress in the treatment of loiasis has been noted for 25
                    years with regard both to therapeutic reactions and to efficacy.</p>

                    hospitalized in Brazzaville (Congo) in 1989.</p>
                <p>METHODS : Study population : children from Brazzaville hospitalised for acute
                    malaria (temperature over 38°C, P.falciparum parasitaemia over 10,000/mm3, no
                    other obvious disease; the reason for hospitalisation often being digestive or
                    neurological disorders. Simplified in vivo test : Quinine was administered by
                    perfusion : 25 mg/kg/day for at least 3 days. Blood was taken at day 0, and
                    before discharge (usually between days 3 and 5). Thick Blood Smears (TBS) were
                    examined for a volume of blood corresponding to 300 leucocytes. Antimalarials
                    häd been taken in 60% of the cases (chloroquine in 67% of the cases, Quinine in
                    10%). Antimalarials were not assayed in the sera.</p>
                <p>RESULTS : (a) 68 cases of non pernicious malaria. No obvious cases of resistance
                    were observed. TBF were negative in 49 out of 52 cases at day 3, in 11 out of 12
                    at day 4 and in four out of four cases at day 5. (b) 96 cases of pernicious
                    malaria : 13 children died, a11 in the first three days. Apyrexia was observed
                    before day 4 in 89% of the cases; only one case of fever at day 7. TBS were
                    negative before day 4 in 97% of the cases. Only one case was suspected of being
                    resistant, with a weakly positive TBS at day 7.</p>
                <p>CONCLUSION : At the dosage of 25 mg/kg, Quinine was found to be very effective in
                    the Congo in 1989 against both pernicious and non pernicious malaria.</p>

                    since 1985.</p>
                <p>METHODS : study population : children from Brazzaville presenting with
                    uncomplicated malaria (temperature over 38°C, P.falciparum parasitaemia over
                    10,000/mm3, no signs of severe malaria, or of other diseases. Patients who had
                    taken A4Q (50% of the cases at least) were not excluded, unlike those who took
                    other antimalarials. Simplified in vivo test : SPC was administered as Fansidar
                    (R) by IM route (S=20 mg/kg; P=1 mg/kg). Blood was taken on day O0 and day 7.
                    Thick blood smears were examined for a volume of blood corresponding to 300
                    leukocytes at day 0 and 1,000 at däy 7.</p>
                <p>RESULTS : Of the 47 children initially included, seven did not complete the test
                    (in two cases because of another treatment prescribed less than 12 hours after
                    SP; in five cases because there was no follow-up on day 7). No clinical failures
                    were observed. Low parasitaemia at day 7 was observed ïin only two cases (6 and
                    18 trophozoiïites/mm3 respectively). The drug was well tolerated.</p>
                <p>CONCLUSION : In the Congo the SR combination should be considered currentiy
                    (1989) as an alternative in the treatment of uncomplicated malaria.</p>

                <p>In thè Fall of 1989, a controlled, double-blind, parallel group trial was
                    implemented in Tahiti to compare both efficacy and tolerability of single dose
                    ivermectin (a new effective anti filarial drug) and single dose DEC (the current
                    standard regimen for mass treatment of bancroftian filariasis in French
                    Polynesia). Fifty eight apparently healthy Wuchereria bancrofti carriers, aged
                    18 to 50 years, in whom microfilarial (mf) density was Z&gt;100 mf/ml were
                    hospitalized for three days and were randomly allocated to 1 of the 3 treatments
                    : ivermectin 100 meg/kg (the dose which resulted in the best efficacy and
                    tolerability profile in a prior dose-ranging study), DEC 3 and DEC 6 mg/kg.
                    Blood mf density determination was carried out on days 0, 7, 30, 90 and 180
                    using membrane filtration technique. During the 3 days following treatment,
                    clinical signs were noted and side effects were graded 0-3 (none, mild,
                    moderate, severe).</p>
                <p>In 23 carriers (40 %), complete clearance of microfilaremia was observed by day 7
                    ; in the other 35, mf reduction ranged from 2 to 99.7 % (median 86 %). Side
                    effects were experienced by 51 carriers (88 %) but only 9 of them (15 %) were
                    unable to perform usual activities for less than 24 hours. Fever, headache,
                    arthralgia and myalgia were the most common signs. Onset and intensity of side
                    effects were significantly associated (p &lt;0.01) with both pretreatment mf
                    densities and peripheral blood parasite clearance. Half of the carriers who were
                    treated either with ivermectin 100 meg/kg or with DEC 3 mg/kg will be retreated
                    at 6 months with a similar dose while the others will be given placebo. Double
                    blind phase will be maintaïined till one month after re treatment. This study
                    will permit assessment as to whether a single ivermectin dose, administered
                    either annually or six-monthly, might be considered for replacement of DEC
                    single dose for chemopraphylaxis of bancroftian filariasis in French

                    Therapeutics - Pharmacokinetics The chemotherapeutic activity of minocycline, a
                    tetracycline analogue, was evaluated in a murine model of toxoplasmosis. A
                    lethal acute toxoplasmosis me to death in control animals 5 +1 days) was
                    produced by injecting 10° tachyzoites of the virulent RH strain of Toxoplasma
                    gondii into the peritoneal cavities of Swiss-Webster female mice. Treatment was
                    given by gavage for 12 days, starting 2 h after intraperitoneal challenge.
                    Thirty days after challenge, 100% of protection was observed when 100 mg/kg of
                    minocycline was administered once daily with a cure rate of 40%, as evidenced by
                    brain subpassages from the surviving mice into naive mice. When 100 mg/kg per
                    day of minocycline was administered in combination with 8.5 mg/kg per day of
                    pyrimethamine (which did not afforded significant protection when used alone at
                    this concentration), a 100% protection rate was also observed, with a cure rate
                    of 50%. A 100% protection rate with a 100% cure rate was observed when mice were
                    treated with 2 daily doses of 100 mg/kg (total dose 200 mg/kg) during 12 days.
                    This curative effect was further documented by Hropathte pieal studies. The
                    serum levels of minocycline after peroral administration were assayed in vitro
                    using a microbiological assay.</p>
                <p>Minocycline serum levels, after single peroral administration of 100 mg/kg to
                    normal mice, peaked at 10 ug/ml after 1 h and showed an extended half-life.</p>
                <p>These studies demonstrate that minocycline is able to protect mice lethally
                    infected with a high inoculum of a highly virulent strain of T. gondiü. Our
                    results also suggest that minocycline is able to penetrate into the brain
                    tissues of the infected mice in which, at some concentrations, exerts a cidal
                    effect on the parasite. The possibility of using minocycline in the treatment of
                    toxoplasmic infections, including encephalitis in patients suffering from the
                    acquired immunodefiency syndrome, deserves further studies.</p>

                    diagnosis of visceral leishmaniasis. The parasite was also found in the liver
                    and retroperitoneal lymph nodes, but a bone marrow aspirate was negative. À
                    month later a HIV infection was discovered.</p>
                <p>During the following 16 months, the patient received 6 antimony cures, as well as
                    one cure each of ketoconazole and allopurinol. Each therapy brought about a
                    temporary clinical improvement, but the patient invaria- bly relapsed with
                    fever, polyadenopathy and hepatomegaly. On 5 occasions throughout the period
                    leishmania parasites were found in bone marrow as- pirates, peripheral blood or
                    lymph node aspirates. Seroloëical tests (immunofluorescence test and counter

                    terme chez des enfants centrafricains de 6 villes du Centrafrique et ont révélé
                    une progression lente de la résistance de P. falciparum qui s'était manifestée
                    pour la première fois en 1983 chez des expatriés résidant à Bangui. En 1989, la
                    chloroquinorésistance ne dépassait nulle part 20% et restait du type RI ou RII.
                    Ces résultats sont confirmés par des séries répétées de microtests OMS in vitro
                    qui en 1989 à Bangui, ont montré que 10% des isolats atteignaient un taux élevé
                    de chloroquinorésistance. En conséquence, il est toujours préconisé au personnel

                    Sudanese schoolchildren with Schistosoma mansoni infection in Feb.</p>
                <p>1987 were followed-up in Oct. 1987 and in Jan. 1989. In Feb. 1987 either 20 mg/kg
                    or 40 mg/kg bodyweight Praziquantel was given in a random fashion. This
                    treatment resulted in substantial decrease of egg output, but continuous
                    reinfection thereafter. Ultrasonographical grading (I - III) of periportal
                    fibrosis (p.F.) was done as published previously by our working group (Am J Trop
                    Med Hyg 41: 63-69; 1989). The total number of patients with p.F. was 36,6% in
                    Febraury 1987, 34,2% in Oct. 1987 and 21,7% in Jan. 1989. Grades II and III of
                    p.F. in Jan. 1989 were only encountered in 4,3% and 0,3% of patients. The
                    respective figures were 21,1% and 5,9% in Feb. 1987 as well as 6,5% and 1,3% in
                    Oct. 1989. This was paralleled by a significant decrease of sonographically
                    determined hepatomegaly from 10,9% to 7%. In contrast the rate of splenomegaly
                    showed a slight increase during the period of observation. The differing dosage
                    regimens of Praziquantel did not result in a significantly diffe- rent
                    reversibility of p.F. or decrease of egg excretion.</p>
                <p>It was concluded that reversibility of p.F. 23 months after antischisto- somal
                    therapy with Praziquantel was substantial despite reinfection of study patients.
                    Results were remarkably superior to those obtained seven month after treatment.

                    using arteether it is of interest to choose a drug showing additive or
                    potentiative effects for use in combination. We have tested arteether in

                    multidrug-resistant KI strain of Plasmodium falciparum using the chess board

                    artecther/meflo- quine combinations. Our results indicate that the
                    administration of quinine or mefloquine together with arteether should have no

                    Scolex Albendazole is known to be a highly effective broad spectrum anthelmintic
                    and can be given at high dosages without severe side-effects. In addition, the
                    drug shows considerable promise for public health programs concerned with the
                    control and eradication of intestinal nematodiasis. It also has high activity
                    against trematode infections and hydatid diseases. Recently, it has been
                    reported to be highly effective in the treatment against Taenia saginata and
                    Taenia solium infections. In order to evaluate the efficacy of albendazole
                    against human taeniasis, a dose of 400 mg x 1 day, 800 mg x 2 days, 800 x 3
                    days, 1,200 mg x 2 days, or 1,200 mg x 3 days was given to 54, 10, 20, 10, 10,
                    and 12 patients, respectively. After the treatment, 5 cases reported with
                    abdominal discomfort, dizziness, and/or headache which were mild and
                    transient.</p>
                <p>Of 76 cases inquired 7-14 days after treatment, 58 were still expelling
                    proglottides and 18 did not notice. Three months later, 73 cases were retreated
                    with atabrine 1.2 gm/case for males, 1.0 gm/case for females. Twentysix expelled
                    44 worms (27 with scolex, 17 without) and 31 patients expelled strobilae and/or
                    segments but none were expelled from the other 9 patients. The 9 negatives
                    represent the number cured by the treatment with albendazole. Thus, the cure
                    rates with albendazole for various regimens were 50% for 800 mg x 3 days, 1,200
                    mg x 2 days, and 1,200 mg x 3 days; 14.3% for 800 mg x 2 days; and 0% for 400 mg
                    x 1 day, and 800 mg x 1 day. These therapeutic results disagree with previous
                    reports. Therefore, albendazole is not highly effective against taeniasis.</p>

                    leishmaniasis The World Health Organization recommended treatment for mucosal
                    leishmaniasis is 20 mg antimony/kg/day for 28 days; however, the efficacy and
                    the toxicity of this regimen have not been reported. We administered this
                    regimen of Pentostam to 29 patients with parasitologically confirmed mucosal
                    leishmaniasis acquired in Peru. 72% of the patients had involvement of both the
                    oral and nasal mucosa. Immediately after treatment all patients showed clinical
                    improvement of mucosal lesions, but only 59% (17/29) of the patients
                    demonstrated complete clinical and parasitologic cure of all mucosal lesions. By
                    the 9-month follow-up, parasites were isolated from mucosal lesions of 6 (21%)
                    of the patients and only 3 patients (11%) showed clinical cure of all lesions.
                    The side effects included: T-wave inversion in 4 patients, abnormal liver
                    function tests in 10 patients and musculo-skeletal pain in 24 patients. The
                    results of this study suggest that the recommended regimen for mucosal
                    leishmaniasis is ineffective for the treatment of mucosal disease involving both
                    the oral and nasal miucosa. Since the side effects were transient and reversible
                    and required suspension of treatment in only 2 (6.9%) of the patients, an
                    increase of the antimony dosage level or length of treatment should be
                    considered as alternative regimens.</p>

                    Cutaneous Lei- shmaniasis (ZCL) is the organic derivative of pentavalent
                    antimony - Solusurmin. We conducted investigations of antimony balance in 16 ZCL
                    patients, treated with 20% Solusurmin solution injected intravenously in a dose
                    of 150 mg/kg body weight once daily for 12-15 days. It was no- ted that 24 hours
                    after the first intravenous injection the excretion of the drug with urine was
                    89-92,2%; with sweat - 0,6-0,65%, with fae- ces - 0,2-1,7%. The total excretion
                    of the element at the end of 24-ho- urs period was 89,8-94,6%, which means that
                    5,4-10,2% of injected pen- tavalent antimony was retained. The studies of
                    antimony balance during the whole course of Solusurmin treatment showed that in
                    this period the excretion of the element with urine, sweat and faeces was
                    88,2-94,4%.</p>

                <p>Parasitic rate at DO was 75%. P. falciparum was present in 96% of the infected

                <p>Mean parasitic density of the subjects included in the study was 2385 PRBC/mm3.
                    At D3, 247 of those treated with chloroquine had few trophozoites (mean density
                    : 65 PRBC/mm3).</p>
                <p>At D7, 17% had trophozoites (mean density : 97 PRBC/mm3). Only 4% of the subjects

                    treated with amodiaquine were carrying of parasites at D3 and 10% at D7, all
                    with very few parasites.</p>
                <p>Rates of resistance to chloroquine were different from one schooi to the other :
                    only 6% and 8% in 2 villages of the bush, 17% in the city of Edea and in the
                    hevea plantation of Nyete, 30% in 2 missionary schools with large medical use.
                    The rates of resistance seemed to be well linked with the use of antimalarial
                    drugs.</p>
                <p>With only 4% of true resistance after oral treatment, chloroquine is still an
                    effective drug against malaria in South-Cameroon, particulary as a first-line

                <p>Albendazole - Hydatidosis Treatment of hydatidosis by surgery was the only
                    available means but it is seldom a radical procedure. There is always the risk
                    of secondary hydatidosis.</p>
                <p>Spillage of cyst contents at operation is difficult to avoid and carries the risk
                    of secondary hydatidosis specially in large hydatids where the laminated
                    membrane is fragile.</p>
                <p>Benzimidazole derivatives have been used as chemotherapeutic agents in the
                    treatment of hydatidosis specially in multiple cystic and multiple organ
                    affections where surgery is of limited value.</p>

                    Plasmodium falciparum aux anti-malariques est suivie depuis 1986.</p>
                <p>OBJECTIF : Proposer des schémas thérapeutiques standardisés privilégiant la voie
                    orale en zone urbaine de haut niveau de résistance de Plasmodium falciparum aux
                    anti-malariques.</p>
                <p>METHODOLOGIE : Etude in vivo in vitro de l'efficacité clinique et parasitologique
                    des anti-malariques disponibles (chloroquine, amodiaquine, sulfadoxine
                    pyriméthamine, quinine, méfloquine) chez des malades en accès palustre simple
                    consultant dans un dispensaire urbain.</p>
                <p>RESULTATS : 50 à 60 % des souches plasmodiales sont résistantes à 25 mg ou 35
                    mg/kg de chloroquine en 3 jours. L'amodiaquine à la posologie de 35 mg/kg en 3
                    jours est efficace dans 96 % des cas. Ce produit est donc proposé en traitement
                    de 1ère intention à la posologie indiquée. La quinine orale à raison de 8 mg/kg
                    toutes les 8 heures pendant 3 jours garde toute son activité et est proposée en
                    2ème intention.</p>

                    concerne le Sud de la France. Malgré la forte immunodépression cellulaire
                    (anergie cutanée, T4 = 65 /mm3) aucun élément en faveur d'une dissémination
                    hématogène n'a été retrouvé : anticorps anti-leishmanies, frottis médullaires et
                    cultures sont restés négatifs. L'évolution a été totalement favorable sous
                    itraconazole (Janssen Pharmaceutica; Beerse, Belgique), à 400 mg/jour durant 3
                    mois. Il n'a pas été observé d'effets secondaires du produit. Aprés 18 mois de

                    treatment, side reactions, compliance The central part of Togo, situated on the
                    southern border-line of the vector-controlled area of the ONCHOCERCIASIS CONTROL
                    PROGRAMME (OCP), has been a problematic zone for the programme for many years
                    due to the regular reinvasion of infected flies. In order to gather experience
                    for further mass treatment, we started a community-based treatment with iver-
                    mectin in six meso- to hyperendemic villages with community microfilarial loads
                    of 2-4 mf/mg skin in 1989. Before treatment, a careful census of the population
                    was taken, about one third of the population was examined parasitologically and
                    ophthalmologically, others received a blanket treatment only (dose: 150 + 50
                    ug/kg). Criteria for exclusion from the treatment were considered as recommended
                    by the producer of the drug. - Treatment coverage was 76% of the recorded
                    population, 11% were absent, 11% were excluded (pregnancy 3%) and 1% refused.
                    After treatment permanent medical aid was available in each village for two to
                    three days with a final control two to four weeks later. Side reactions were
                    observed in 14% of the treated population, 7% were handicapped at work and 2%
                    were unable to work for at least one day. Itching, swellings and pain were the
                    most frequent side reactions.</p>
                <p>Acute dysdpnoe, collapse, fever of more than 39°C, cases of inbarable itching and
                    various kinds of pain were considered as severe. The symptoms persisted for up
                    to one week, and edema of the extremities even lasted for two to four weeks. -
                    Compliance: A later re- examination revealed that 15% of the actual population
                    had missed the census, and not all moderate side reactions were reported. À
                    considerable migration of the population has to be considered for further
                    trials, because one third to half of the inhabitants recorded in 1985 were
                    absent. The next follow-up will take place after one year. (With support of the

                    was assessed in asymptomatic schoolchildren in Dodoma by the standard 7-day in
                    vivo test. Chloroquine and amodiaquine were administered at a total dose of 25
                    mg kg-1 body weight divided ovér three days. Fansidar and Metakelfin were given
                    in single curative doses. Succesful parasitological follow-ups were made for
                    101, 108,97 and 95 cases on Chloroquine, amodiquine, Fansidar, and Metakelfin,
                    respectively. Chloroquine showed a failure rate of 28%. Only one case failed to
                    respond to Metakelfin.</p>
                <p>Amodiaquine and Fansidar were fully effective. Mean parasite clearance times in
                    days were 3.4 for chloroquine, 2.9 for amadiaquine, and 2.7 for both Fansidar
                    and Metakelfin. Results for micro in vitro tests revealed a 40% (17/43)
                    resistance to chloroquine. There was no in_vitro resistance to amodiaquine.
                    These results indicate that chloroquine, the commonly used drug in Tanzania, is
                    not as effective as amodiaquine, a less used antimalarial. On the other hand,
                    the "antifols'"' normally used as second line drugs in the country are still
                    effective and should thus be protected and used judiciously.</p>

                    patients were admitted at the Muheza District Hospital for the treatment of
                    falciparum malaria. Forty nine patients were allocated to the chloroquine group

                    weight of either chloroquine or amodiaquine were given to the patients over a

                <p>Thirty three of the patients failed to respond to their respective regimens

                    and 7 at RIII whilst amodiaquine had 6 cases at RII and 2 at RIII. These
                    resistant cases were then prescribed single curative doses of Fansidar according
                    to age: less than 4 years % tablet, 4-8 years 1 tablet, 9-14 years 2 tablets and
                    15 years and above 3 tablets according to weight. The patients were then

                    refractory TANZANTA SUMMARY À combination of DL-&amp;-difluoromethylornithine
                    (DFMO) and suramin has been tested in 3 cases of Mel B refractory late stage
                    rhodesiense sleeping sickness, and is curative. In the curative protocol DFMO is
                    given as continuous I.V. infusion at a dose of 800mg/kg every 24 hours for the
                    first 14 days followed by oral DFMO at a dose of 75mg/kg every 6 hours for the
                    following 21 days, and suramin is administered at a dose of lg as a 10% aqueous
                    solution via slow I.V. once weekly for a maximum of 5 weeks on day 1,7,14,21,28
                    of DFMO administration. This combination has clearly a favourable effect on the
                    clinical symptoms of late stage sleeping sick- ness. The immediate therapeutic
                    results observed call for an extended study of this DFMO combination which
                    appears to have significant adva- ntage in MelB refractory cases.</p>

                    finding of patologic structured tumors in liver on Computer tomography or
                    Ultrasonography were the first or only signs of parasitic infection. The picture
                    of these laesions were nonspecific. Prac- tically in all cases a false diagnosis
                    in these patients, according to li- ver findings on CT and USG was done:
                    haemangioma, metastasis of tumor of unknown localisation, hepatoma etc./ Because
                    in all hepatic morphologic laesions of unknow etiology serology for toxocarosis,
                    amoebiasis, cysti- cercosis, echinococosis and fasciolosis is realised, /Before

                    Dohme and Chibret/ was used, in dose 1,5 g from 14-to 21 days. After treatement
                    reduction of patologic picture on CT or USG could be seen, after second etape of
                    treatement with tiabendazol changes in den- sity, area and structure of
                    morphological findings on CT and USG picture appeared. Serological response

                    study was to evaluate the effectiveness of albenda- zole /Zentel-Smith Klime
                    Freuch/ treatment of patients infected with intestinal helminthes.The study #as
                    carried out in 200 patients /male and female/ageing from 3 to 72
                    years.Therapeutic effect of albendazole was asseased on a dayonly basis at the
                    Intestinal Disease Conter in Warsaw.The patients suffered from infections caused
                    by nemathelminthes or platyhelminthes.The patients infected with nemathelminthes
                    were given 400 mg of albendazole in one dose immediarely after breakfast and the
                    patients infected with platyhelminthes were given 400 mg of the drug once a day
                    during 3 consecutive days.No side effects were observed du- ring the treatment
                    in both groups of the patients.The effectiveness of albendazole treatment
                    equaled to 90% in patients infected with Ascaris lumbricoides /n=40/97% in
                    patients infected with Oxyuris vermicularis /n=64/ 71% in patients infected
                    Trichuris trichiura /n=28/,and 47% in parients infected with Taenia /n-68/.</p>
                <p>Conclusions -Albendazole is very effective and well tolerated in the treatment of
                    patients infected with nemathelminthes.The effectiveness of albendazole in the
                    treatment of infectiona caused by platyhelminthes is much lower.</p>

                    — Selective chemoprophylaxis — immune response In 1984, wxo | recommended
                    selective short-term chemoprophylaxis for residents of areas with intense
                    Plasmodium falciparum transmission. While such selective intervention is not
                    likely to induce drug resistance, the effects om the immune response of
                    pretected individuals has not been adequately investigated.</p>
                <p>This study was carried out in a holeendemic malarious region of northernm
                    Nigeria. 17 semi-immume adult volunteers received 300 mg chleroquine base weekly
                    for 6 months. Throughout the period of protectiem none of them deve- leped
                    P.falciparum parasitaemia, but there Was a resurgence ef malaria in the
                    post-intérvention phase. 3 months after starting prophylaxis a significant
                    reduction of IFAT titres Was seen lasting up to 2 months after àrug with—
                    drawal. 2 months after chloraquine withdrawal, serum concentrations of IgG and
                    factor B were significantly reduced. 3 months after initiating prophylaxis, a
                    temporary but significant decrease of 1£G and IgM serum concentrations was found
                    with a cerresponding declime in the number of B-lymphocytes and regula- tory
                    T-cells. These returned to normal at 6 months of prophylaxis. Our fin-— dings
                    suggest that short-term malaria chemoprophylaxis may sigmificantly in terfere

                    Falciparum malaria, chemoresistance, Africa Concomittantly with the discovery of
                    resistance, 35 cases of chloroquine resistant falciparum malaria were observed
                    between 1985 and 1989 in endemic countries of equatorial Africa, and in
                    Madagascar. Patients stayed in the endemic areas 216 +/- 160 months and came to
                    our hospital 47 +/- 67 days after their return. 17 (49%) had taken 4 amino
                    quinoline regularly for prevention, and 18 (51%) for treatment of malaria.
                    Asthenia or splenomegaly were observed in 51% of cases, weight loss in 31%,
                    clinical anemia and anorexia in 20%. Body temperature was normal in 66% of
                    cases. Before treatment, hemoglobin was 10.6 +/- 1.4 g/d1, erythrocyte
                    sedimenta- tion rate was 57 +/- 28 mm per hour and there was an increase in IgG
                    and IgM (IgG, 22 +/- 6 g/1 ; IgM, 7.+/-5 g/1). Thin and thick blood smears were
                    negative ih 63% of cases and revealed only a few plasmodia in 37% of cases.
                    Specific antibody titers measured by immunofluorescence were 48600 in 37% of
                    cases, 16200 in 49%, and 5400 in 14%. Mefloquine therapy was used in 80% of
                    cases. Clinical and biological improve- ment were observed 46 +/- 23 days after
                    the beginning of therapy. This study clearly points out new clinical and
                    biological aspects of resistant falciparum malaria, which have not been observed
                    previously in long staying residents in equatorial Africa, nor in

                    (Hoffmann-LaRoche, Switzerland) was given in a single dose once in two weeks.
                    The duration of treatment depended od results of clinical examinations and
                    specific serological tests and oscillated from 3 to 15 months (mean period was 6

                <p>Muheza district in north-Eastern Tanzania has holoendemic malaria with moderate
                    levels and degrees of chloroquine resistance. Because of this,there is an
                    ongoing project searching for an alternative malaria chemoprophylactic regimen
                    during pregnancy whereby pregnant women mostly primiparae and secundiparae are
                    randomly given either 300mg chloroquine base once weekly or 200mg daily
                    proguanil (Paludrine).</p>
                <p>Breakthroughs presenting with clinical attacks of malaria are treated with 25mg
                    chloroquine base/kg (25CQ) over three days. Consdering the consquent loss of
                    some malaria protective immunity during pregnancy plus the prevailing drug
                    resistance, the women's response to this treatment was monitored through an
                    extended 28 days in vivo testing. After three days of supervised drug
                    administration,follow up blood smears were collected on days 7,14,21 and 28.</p>
                <p>Between March and May 1989,49 women were treated accordingly,resulting into
                    32(65%) parasitological clearances and 17(35%) failures within 7 days. Two of 17
                    failures (127) exhibited RIII type of response and the remaining 15 (88%) had a
                    favuurable clinical response. Only 6 (19%) of 32 cleared patients either
                    recrudesced or got reinfected during the three weeks follow up period (i.e. 53%
                    complete cure rate).</p>
                <p>Overal1,25CQ has proven efficacious during this peak malaria transmission season
                    and inspite of the prevailing chloroquine resistance. This, in addition to its

                <p>falciparum malaria in Uganda and yet the latter is vital to planning future drug
                    related strategies for both treatment and control. The clinical and
                    parasitological response of P.falciparum was prospectively assessed in 6
                    districts using the standard WHO in vivo and in vitro methodologies.</p>
                <p>Despite a high level of chloroquine (CQ) resistancein 5 districts there was
                    remarkable clinical amelioration in the majority of cases. CQ sensitivity was
                    retained in the most inaccessible area of NW Uganda, Arua. The parasite was more
                    sensitive to amodiaquine (AQ) in vitro at all sites and
                    pyrimethamine-sulfadoxine (PSD) cleared 100% of primary infections. However
                    there were 4/37(9.8%) PSD failures at 7 day follow up of chloroquine resistant
                    cases retreated with PSD.</p>
                <p>Chloroquine should remiain the primary therapy for P.falciparum malaria in Uganda
                    with AQ and PSD in reserve for treatment failures. More emphasis should be
                    placed on the objective diagnosis and follow up of the cases and the correct
                    dosage of antimalarials should be stressed to all patients. Continuing drug
                    surveillance is of importance and for this to be appropriate more emphasis
                    should be put onto clinical rather than parasitological endpoints.</p>

                <p>Chloroquine resistance is widespread throughout eastern Africa. The closely
                    related amodiaquine has in the past retained significant sensitivity in the face
                    of this resistance. However life threatening amodiaquine toxicity reported with
                    chemo- prophylactic use, appears to be restricting its use therapeutically. We
                    therefore prospectively compared the 4-aminoquinolines in vivo and all parasites
                    harvested in- vitro against 4-aminoquinolines, mefloquine and quinine, from sick
                    outpatients.</p>
                <p>Amodiaquine was significantly more effective than chloroquine against
                    P.falciparum malaria in 134 outpatients at a Rift Valley hospital during 1989;
                    WHO 7 day test, 91.2% versus 47% sensitivity (p 0.001). Clinically, 97% of the
                    amodiaquine patients became asymptomatic compared to 75% of the chloroquine
                    patients, although there was no significant difference in the defervescence
                    times of 1.6 and 1.9 days (p Q.1).</p>
                <p>In vitro sensitivity of the harvested parasites was broadly similar and 93.5% of
                    the 4-aminoquinoline failures were cleared with FansidarR- There was no evidence
                    of severe toxicity in any of the trial patients.</p>
                <p>In view of the relatively low cost of amodiaquine it should be considered as a
                    viable replacement for chloroquine in those areas with documented high levels of
                    chloroquine resistance, and as the second line therapeutic antimalarial in other

                    TOLERANCE Fourty black patients of the Lekoumou region (RP Congo) were included
                    in this study aimed at testing the hypothesis that a potent and specific anti Hi
                    with a known effect on eosinophils in allergy could help decreasing several
                    symptoms (and especially pruritus) of untreated loiasis which is often
                    accompanied by hioh eosinophil blood levels. All patients were suffering from
                    loiasis and due to the local sanitary condi- tions were unlikely to benefit of
                    an etiologic treatment of their disease such as diethylcarbamazine. The study
                    was randomized, and under double-blind, cross-over conditions. Cetirizine 20 mg
                    treatment or placebo was administered for a 6 week-period of time. Clinical
                    parameters such as pruritus, prurigo, eruption, arthraloia, Calabar's oedema and
                    migration of adult worm did not differ from each other under cetirizine or
                    placebo. Interestingly, pruritus was dramatically but similarly decreased in
                    both groups. Prevalence of L. loa microfilariae carriers did not change.
                    Biological para- meters did not change either or sligahtly but in the same
                    extent in both groups.</p>
                <p>Eosinophil tended to sligahtly decrease more under cetirizine than under placebo
                    but the difference is not significant. An eruption occured from day 2 to 42
                    under cetirizine and around day 21 under placebo in the same patient. No other
                    side-effects were mentioned. It is concluded that cetirizine alone does not
                    improve symptoms of loiasis but that the drug was well tolerated. Role of
                    eosinophils in allergy and in parasitic diseasesare discussed.</p>

                    the specimen were proved by section due to E.multilocularis. Radical resection
                    of the lesion was commonly su- ggested as treatment of choice with excellent
                    result, but the resectabili- ty wes low only 10.5%. Tke palliative resettion was
                    22.1%, drainage and irrigation of necrotic central cavity 15.5% with much

                    Fasciola hepatica, triclabendazole, chimiothérapie, CGP 23030.</p>
                <p>Fasinex® s'est avéré très efficace en médecine vétérinaire contre les vers
                    adultes - jeunes ou mûrs - de Fasciola hepatica (F.h.) et gigantica. Pour
                    l’homme il manque un fasciolicide qui soit efficace après un jour de traitement.
                    Au jour de soumission de ce résumé 14 malades infectés de F.h. sont connus du
                    présentateur pour avoir reçu du triclabendazole: 6 porteurs d’oeufs de F.h. et 8
                    avec anticorps contre F.h. et éosino- philie accompagnatrice. 7 des 8 malades
                    montraient des lésions parenchymateuses sur CAT scan hépatique. Le
                    triclabendazole (CGP 23030) fut essentiellement donné en dose de 10 mg/kg par
                    prise, soit unique, soit répétée une fois. 3 malades avaient résisté à un
                    traitement préalable par d’autres fasciolicides. La pharmacocinétique du tricla-
                    bendazole fut étudiée grâce à une méthode de dosage par chromatographie en phase
                    liquide. Les concentrations plasmatiques du métabolite sulphoxide furent
                    nettement plus élevées que celles du métabolite sulphone et du produit inchangé.
                    Tous les malades sont considérés guéris et la tolérance fut excellente pour tous
                    sauf 3 qui présentèrent des douleurs hypochondriaques droites avec ou sans
                    altérations des fonctions hépatiques autour du 4e jour. Ce phénomène fut observé
                    chez des excréteurs d'oeufs de F.h. et pourrait être lié à l'élimination des
                    vers adultes du système biliaire. À 3 mois les CAT scans ont montré une
                    restitution du parenchyme hépatique, une baisse des éosinophiles et des
                    anticorps contre F.h. ainsi qu’une absence d’oeufs de F.h. dans les selles.</p>
                <p>En conclusion: Le triclabendazole est actif dans la fasciolose humaine invasive
                    et chronique à dosage oral d’un seul jour. Le dosage optimal est encore à
                    déterminer.</p>

                <p>Suspectée cliniquement en 1975, la résistance de Plasmodium falciparum à la
                    chloroquine à Madagascar n'a été confirmée qu'en 1981. À compter de 1983,
                    plusieurs études furent menées en divers points de l'île par l'Institut Pasteur
                    de Madagascar, in vivo selon le protocole thérapeutique standard de l'OMS, in
                    vitro par le semi microtest de LE BRAS d'abord dans sa version optique et à
                    partir de 1985 dans sa version isotopique.</p>
                <p>Jusqu'en 1987, la situation est restée stable avec in vivo 4 à 12 % des
                    infections résistantes de type R1 et une-seule de type R2 sur 148 explorées dans
                    diverses régions de l'Ile. In vitro moins de 10 % des souches sont
                    résistantes.</p>
                <p>En 1988 et 1989, la réponse thérapeutique à la chloroquine a été étudiée chez 255
                    individus infectés par P.falciparum à Sainte Marie et sur les Hauts Plateaux.
                    Parmi ces sujets on observe 13% de réponse de type R2 et 15,5% de réponse de
                    type R1. De plus 28,5% d'entre eux avaient une goutte épaisse négative à J7 mais
                    positives à J14 démontrant qu'ils étaient probablement victimes d'une infection
                    résistante à la chloroquine. In vitro, 28% des souches étaient résistantes à la
                    chloroquine.</p>
                <p>La chloroquine reste encore à Madagascar, l'antimalarique de choix par son action
                    constante sur les signes cliniques et la densité parasitaire ainsi que par sa
                    tolérance et sa facilité d'utilisation en auto traitement. La vigilance s'impose
                    cependant devant l'aggravation observée récemment qui peut faire craindre
                    l'apparition rapide de résistances de type R3.</p>

                    mg / kg body weight. The effectiveness of the drug was evaluated in the first
                    month after treatment, clini- cally and parasitologically, and eight months
                    later again, using immu- nological tests in addition to the other

                <p>Une jeune femme de 23 ans, sans antécédent particulier a reçu une
                    chimioprophylaxie anti-palustre par Chloroquine (100 mg/jour) à l'occasion d'un
                    voyage en Centre-Afrique. Au cours de son séjour, elle a présenté un épisode
                    fébrile non docu- menté pour lequel un traitement présomptif par Halofantrine a
                    été instauré sans inter- ruption de la Chloroquine. Six heures après la
                    troisième prise de la deuxième cure d'Halofantrine (500 mg X 3/cure) et après 36
                    jours de prophylaxie par Chloroquine, une crise convulsive est survenue. Sept
                    jours après l'accident, date du retour en France, l'examen neurologique, le
                    bilan biologique et l'examen tomodensitomètrique cérébral étaient normaux.
                    L'électro-encéphalogramme objectivait des anomalies paroxystiques postérieures
                    évoquant une crise convulsive récente. Les taux sanguins de Chloroquine,
                    d'Halofantrine, et de Desbutylhalofantrine étaient respectivement de 1,2 mg/1,
                    73 ng/ml, et 84 ng/ml. Un mois plus tard, en l'absence de tout traitement,
                    l'électro- encéphalogramme était normal et le taux plasmatique d'Halofantrine de
                    35 ng/ml.</p>
                <p>L'hypothèse d'une encéphalopathie parasitaire est peu probable compte-tenu de
                    l'évolu- tion. La prise concomittente de Chloroquine et d'Halofantrine a pu
                    provoquer un cumul des toxicités de ces produits ou de leurs métabolites. Sans
                    affirmer la responsabilité exclusive de l'Halofantrine, nous attirons
                    l'attention sur le fait que cette molécule, comme les autres antipaludéens, peut
                    être impliquée dans la survenue de crises convul- sives.</p>

                    discarded for safety reasons, and 1gG extracted from the remaining in condition
                    allowing their use by the IV route.</p>
                <p>8 Thai patients with P. falciparum parasitaemia were treated by IV inoculation of
                    the 1gG, 6 at a 100 mg/kg dose over 3 days (20, 30, 50 mg/kg), one at a 20 mg/kg
                    single dose, and one at a 200 mg/kg single dose.</p>
                <p>To ensure a safety margin of at least 48 hours receivers were chosen among
                    patients having a recrudescent parasitaemia following Quinine treatment failure
                    at the RI level. At that stage symptoms were mild or absent and parasitaemia was
                    rising but low (range 4.600 to 9.200/mi).</p>
                <p>The IgG pool proved to exert a consistent, strain-independant, stage-specific,
                    and non-sterilizing effect, and proved to be safe. Asexual parasitaemia
                    decreased by a mean 728 fold (range 46 to 1086), while gametocytes were
                    unaffected. Clearance of parasites and symptoms was as fast or faster than with
                    drugs (79 and 47 hours respectively). It was consistent in the 8 patients
                    treated thus suggesting that target antigens were equally expressed in
                    geographically remote isolates. In peripheral blood smears no mature form was
                    seen at any time of the follow-up and thus do not support the hypothesis that
                    reversal of cytoadherence occured.</p>
                <p>After the disappearance of the transferred antibodies, recrudescent parasites
                    from 3 patients were found susceptible to the same extend (mean decrease 1310
                    fold ) to the same 1gG preparation, thus indicating that no selection of
                    parasites able to escape the effect of antibodies had occured. No adverse
                    side-effect was detected during the follow-up which lasted one year.</p>

                    therapy Ivermectin is a semisynthetic macrocyclic lactone that has been shoun to
                    produce a potent therapeutic effect agaînst various species of arthropods and
                    many animal parasites. This drug has also been found to be highly ef fective
                    against larval forms of some pathogenic Filaria spp. infecting man. More
                    recently there are two prelimi nary reports of Ivermectin producing good cure
                    rates in South american patients infected \vith roundworms. E Our preliminary
                    trial was to assess the effectiveness of this drug in the treatment of
                    autochthonous strongyloi diasis in ten subjects. Although principally found in
                    tropical and subtropical areas, Strongyloides stercoralis infection is also
                    endemic in certain temperate countries. In Italy, and particularly in the
                    district of Pavia, the persistence of this helminthiasis and of the free-living
                    cycle of the parasite is favoured by warm-humid climate and agriculture-devoted
                    economy.</p>
                <p>AT ten patients in our study were immunocompetent and denied travel in tropical
                    countries. Autochthonous infec tion was diagnosed by serial concentrated stool
                    examinations and Baermann's test. Six subjects were males and _ four females
                    (age range: 42-74 years; mean 58 y). Four patients were institutionalized
                    mntally retarded, four were local farmers, and the remaining two were subjects
                    with a particular interest in gardening. Treatment with Ivermectin (Mectizan,
                    MSD-Chibret, Paris, France) was made in a single 12 mg oral dose. The drug was
                    well tole rated and no-noteuorthy side-effects were seen. Therapeutic follow-up
                    was performed by two parasitological con trols (1 and 3 months later). One
                    subject defaulted and did not return after treatment. A1 patients but this one
                    recovered, with a cure rate of 90%.</p>
                <p>Our preliminary study shows Ivermectin therapy for human strongyloidiasis to be
                    highly effective and well tole rated. À controlled trial in a larger nurber of

                    Thailand human gnathostomiasis; albendazole; drug effect; parasite migration
                    Human gnathostomiasis is characterized by space-occupying inflammatory lesions
                    and/or haemorrhage as à result of the migration of, very often, a single larva
                    of Gnathostoma spinigerum. Intermittent cutaneous migratory swellings occurring
                    over years is the most common manifestation and the rare cerebral invasion may
                    be fatal.</p>
                <p>There are currently no effective anthelminthic for this infection.</p>
                <p>During a randomized placebo control trial evaluating the efficacy of albendazole
                    in cutaneous gnathostomiasis at a dosage of 400 mg twice daily for two days it
                    was observed that gnathostome larvae tended to migrate outward as à result of
                    the treatment so that they could be recovered by excisional biopsy or by needle
                    picking.</p>
                <p>In the placebo-treated group (N =40) no such migration was observed during the
                    3209 patient-day of follow-up, while in the albendazole treated group (N=40)
                    there were one worm in the excisional biopsy done on day 14 and two worms
                    removed from the skin by the patients themselvweson days 9 and 14. Assuming that
                    the period of drug exposure of the gnathostomes was the 14 days of albendazole
                    administration plus another washout period of 7 days (equivalent to 20
                    half-lifes of the active detectable metabolite) the total patient-day of
                    albendazole exposure was 793. The incidence of outward migration of gnathostomes
                    in the drug treated group (3 per 793 patient-days) was significantly (p&lt;0.05)
                    higher than in the placebo group (0 per 3209 patient-days) This unique and
                    inexplicable effect of alberfdazole on the parasite migration is beneficial to
                    the human host and should be of therapeutic value in gnathostomiasis.</p>

                <p>It is generally accepted that the control of schistosomiasis is acco- mplished by
                    combination of parasite control (chemotherapy) and vector control
                    (mollusciciding and environmental manipulation). Endemic manso- ni and

                    where the prevalence exceeds 80% in children (1985). General public health
                    measures - health education, sanitation and clean water supply - were vigorously
                    implemented for several years, before mass chemotherapy was used early 1990;
                    then, Praziquantel was administered orally as a single dose (4Omg/kg), to all
                    children and adults.</p>
                <p>The impact of this chemotherapy is assessed by comparing the disease prevalence
                    before chemotherapy and 3 months later. Whereas the S.haema- tobium prevalence
                    in school children was 83.6%, in 1985, it became....% early 1990 before mass

                    concentrations of the fatty acids or methyl ester were added to the medium and
                    incubated for 1h. Trypanosome motility was determined by counting the number of
                    motile parasites in a Neubauer hemocytometer. In further study with the more
                    toxic PUFAS, and the lyso-Pt-Cho derivatives, time dependent experiments were
                    conducted in the medium supplimented with 15% v/v horse serum. The results
                    demonstrated that while the saturated fatty acids, n-6 series of PUFA of
                    comparable chain lengths displayed little toxicity, the T. b. brucei were highly

                    which would lead (simulation) to 400 nmol/1 ApQ 24 h after second injection
                    (d-3). Validation of this regimen was undergo in 47 semi immune Plasmodium
                    falciparum malaria patients in 1989 in Mounana hospital, Gabon, selected from a
                    larger study on the basis of chloroquine (CQ) or monodesethylamodiaquine (AqM1)
                    &lt;100 nmol/I at d-3. Twenty were 14 to 48 months-old, 27 were 5 to 42 yrs-old.
                    Blood drug levels were determined with an HPLC method at d-1 for CQ and AqM1 and
                    at d-3 for CQ, AqM1 and ApQ.</p>
                <p>Mean parasitaemia in selected patients was 69550/ul (d-1). In vitro
                    chemosensitivity on d-1 was interpretable in 23 cases. Median IC50$ were : 12.3
                    + 4.6 (ApQ, n=21), 218 + 73 (CQ, n=16 chloroquine resistant strains) and 234 +
                    21 (CQ, n=7 chloroquine sensitive strains) nmol/1. Mean parasitaemia at d-3 was
                    49/ul, parasitaemia was cleared on d-8 but one . Blood ApQ levels at d-3 were
                    213 + 93 (84-579) nmol/I, concentration which was lower than this simulated from
                    kinetics results. Two patients had low levels (39, 58 nmol/1). One was cured,
                    the other had 960 asexual Plasmodium falciparum /yl on d-8.</p>
                <p>This 12 mg/kg in 2 injections IM dose was well toterated in all patients : only a
                    burning sensation at the injection site was reported and lasted for one day
                    maximum. This regimen demonstrates a satisfactory efficacy in an area where d-8
                    failure rate of 25 mg/kg CQ was 29 % in 1989 in children.</p>

                <p>Cerebral Malaria, Chloroquine, Quinine, route The mortality from cerebral malaria
                    is unacceptably high. Most cases come from the rural areas in the tropics. We
                    therefore tried L different regimes namely subcutaneous chloroquine,
                    intramuscular chloroquine, intravenous chloroquine and intravenous quinine in 86
                    children who were age and sex-matched. This is with the goal of having a simple
                    mode of treatment for the tropics.</p>
                <p>The results showed that in the children who had subcutaneous chloroquine, the
                    mean fever clearance time was L9+21 hours. 66% recovered from coma at the end of
                    72 hours and ‘the mean parasite clearance time was L8 hours. The mortality was
                    27% In the children who had intramuscular chloroquine mean fever clearance time
                    was 39416 h. 83% recovered from coma at the end of 72 hours. Mean parasite
                    clearance time was 32420 hours. The mortality was 17%. In the children who had
                    intravenous chloroquine, the mean fever clearance time was 54431 hours, 60%
                    recovered from coma at the end of 72 hours, mean parasite clearance time was 60
                    hours. Mortality was nil. In the children with intravenous quinine the fever
                    clearance time was 61.7+432 h. 92% had recovered from coma at the end of 72
                    hours. The mean parasite clearance time was 50.1 hours. Mortality was 12%.</p>
                <p>This study shows that i.v. chloroquine was superior to other modalities of
                    therapy, and that s.c. chloroquine is unsuitable in cerebral malaria.</p>

                    J.A.G., D. Morgan, A. McNicholas, G. Maude, A. Foster Onchocerciasis Ivermectin
                    Chemotherapy We have investigated the clinical and parasitological effects of
                    four doses of ivermectin at 6-monthly intervals on the population of six
                    villages in Sierra Leone where onchocerciasis is hyperendemic. The study was a
                    double blind placebo controlled trial with assessments before and then six
                    months after each treatment round.</p>
                <p>656 villagers received all four doses of treatment. In the ivermectin group
                    microfilarial prevalence and density fell markedly and sustainedly. There have
                    been no corresponding changes in clinical features such as the prevalence of
                    onchocercal skin lesions, itching, visual loss or in markers of general health.
                    Ophthalmological examinations showed a significant reduction in the ivermectin
                    group of anterior segment signs (punctate keratitis, sclerosing keratitis,
                    iritis, cataract), but a significant increase in posterior segment signs (optic
                    atrophy, choroidoretinitis, vascular sheathing).</p>
                <p>It is now generally agreed that mass treatment with ivermectin is unlikely to
                    effectively block transmission of onchocerciasis and the drug should be reserved
                    for control of disease morbidity. Our results show no clear cut benefits from
                    four doses of ivermectin and suggest deleterious effects on the posterior
                    segment of the eye. Plans for the mass-distribution of ivermectin in
                    onchocerciasis-endemic areas need critical consideration.</p>

                <p>Artemisinin, a new potent antimalarial drug, is a fast acting blood-
                    schizontocide. Parasite clearance is faster than with any other antimalarial
                    drug. Although in China more than 2000 patients were succesfuily treated,
                    reliable pharmacokinetic data in humans are not available. Knowledge of the
                    basic pharmacokinetics is very important in the development of artemisinin
                    formulations to be used in the treatment of Plasmodium falciparum
                    infections.</p>
                <p>The pharmacokinetics of healthy volunteers received an rectal route. In addition,
                    the To study the effects caused by artemisinin were examined in a four-way
                    cross-over study. Ten aqueous artemisinin suspension by the oral, intramuscular
                    and drug was administered intramuscularly as an oil suspensior.</p>
                <p>route of administration rather than formulation differences, the same aqueous
                    suspension was used for the oral, intramuscular and rectal routes. À wash- out
                    period of one week was maintained between the test days. Artemisinin
                    concentrations in serum were monitored using a HPLC assay with UV detection
                    after derivatisation.</p>
                <p>After oral administration artemisinin is rapidly but incompletely absorbed. The
                    mean absorption time was 0.78 + 0.41 h and the absorption half live 0.54 + 0.29
                    h. The bio- availability of the oral formulation, compared with the
                    intramuscular oil suspension was 32.2 + 7.5 %. The mean residence time (10.6 +
                    5.8 h) of the latter was three times that of the oral formulation (3.4 + 0.7 h).
                    This seems to permit a twice daily dose regimen for the intramuscular oil
                    injection, whereas the oral formulation necessitates a more frequent dosing
                    interval. Artemisinin serum levels after rectal and intramuscular administration
                    of aqueous suspensions were very low and variable, indicating a poor and erretic
                    absorption.</p>

                    human cases of kala-azar were diagnosed in Saddaguia District, Sidi Bouzid,
                    Central Tunisia, where the disease had not previously been recorded. It is
                    noteworthy that the cases occurred after the completion of a major irrigation
                    development. A search was made for a dog reservoir of infection by serological
                    (IFAT) surveys outside the seasons of transmission in 1987-1989. 998 dogs were
                    examined representing about 90% of the canine population. 73 (7.3%) sero-
                    positive dogs were found and put down with the agreement of the owners. Since
                    March, 1988, no other cases have been detected in the inhabitants of the area
                    which suggests that the elimination of the seropositive dogs reduced or
                    eliminated the risk of infection. Surveillance of the dogs is continuing. This
                    survey gave us the opportunity to evaluate the feasibility of integrating canine
                    surveys.and elimination of seropositive dogs into the local primary health care
                    activities. It also emphasized the importance of health education to improve the
                    social acceptability of such an approach and to encourage community
                    participation in eliminating stray dogs and preventing the immigration of dogs
                    from other areas.</p>

                <p>This influence needs to be pre- and post- natal, since offspring born to infected
                    mo- thers but fostered by uninfected ones, as well as offspring only fostered by
                    infected mice, had mortality rates higher than in controls, but significantly
                    lower than in mice born and fostered by infected mothers.</p>
                <p>This decreased resistance is T.cruzi svecific, since offsprino infected by
                    Plasmodium chabaudi or Schistosoma mansoni instead of T.cruzi, induced similar
                    mortality rates, parasite levels and Schistosoma egg granuloma sizes in both
                    grouvs born to T.cruzi infec- ted and uninfected mothers.</p>
                <p>Such features are in agreement with a maternally induced-immunological impairment
                    of the offspring's immune response. À similar harmful effect of human mothers on
                    their offspring could contribute to explain the high death rate of acute phase
                    af acquired T.cruzi infection, classically observed in young children from
                    endemic areas.</p>

                <p>In October 1989 a controlled, double-blind parallel group trial was implemented
                    in Tahiti to compare both efficacy and tolerability of single doses of
                    ivermectin (a new effective anti-filarial drug) and DEC (the current standard
                    regimen for mass treatment of bancroftian filariasis in French Polynesia). Fifty
                    eight apparently healthy Wuchereria bancrofti carriers, aged 18 to 50 years, in
                    whom microfilarial (mf) density was &gt; 100 mf/ml were hospitalized.</p>
                <p>Of them, 23, 24 and 11 were randomly allocated to treatment with respectively
                    ivermectin 100 mcg/kg (the dose which resulted in the best efficacy and
                    tolerability profile in a prior dose-ranging study), DEC 3 and DEC 6 mg/kg. One
                    week after treatment, clearance of microfilaremia (determined by membrane
                    filtration technique) was complete in 22 of the 23 carriers treated with
                    ivermectin and in one only of the 35 treated with DEC.</p>
                <p>Geometric mean for mf densities was significantly lower (p &lt; 0.001) in
                    carriers treated with ivermectin than in those treated with DEC at one month,
                    but neither at 3 (p = O.26) nor at 6 months (p = 0.63) after treatment.</p>
                <p>Three and six months after treatment, mf levels were 14 and 28%, 21.6 and 19.4%,
                    and 10.2 and 8.4% of pretreatment mf levels in carriers treated respectively
                    with ivermectin, DEC 3 and DEC 6 mg/kg. During the 3 days following treatment,
                    clinical signs were noted according to a check list: side effects were
                    experienced by 51 carriers (88%) but, actually, only 9 of them (15%) were unable
                    to perform usual activities (for less than 24 hours). Fever, headache,
                    arthralgia and myalgia were the most common signe. Onset and intensity of side
                    effects were significantly associated (p &lt; 0.01) with both pretreatment mf
                    densities and peripheral blood parasite clearance.</p>
                <p>Efficacy of ivermectin single dose treatment was superior to that of a single
                    dose of DEC in terms of immediate mf clearance but not in terms of sustained mf
                    decrease at 6 months. Finally, side effects observed in carriers treated with
                    ivermectin were neither quantitatively nor qualitatively different from those
                    observed in carriers treated with DEC.</p>

                <p>Jirds were treated with 2 doses of 25 mg/kg CGP-20376, p.o., 3, 24, or 153 days
                    after s.c. injections of 200 Brugia malayi L3 (groups À, B, and C). Efficacy was
                    assessed parasitologically and by monitoring circulating filarial antigen by
                    ELISA. Prophylaxis in group 2 was 100% effective. None of 6 animals in group B
                    developed microfilaremia, and no worms were recovered at necropsy 10 months
                    after infection. Farasite antigenemia cleared within 2 mo of treatment ih 3 of
                    these animals.</p>
                <p>Eowever, persistance of antigenemia in 3 other animals suggested that some worms
                    survived the therapy. Four of 6 animals in group C cleared their microfilaremias
                    and were free of adult worms 5 mo after treatment. Parasite antigen titers
                    decreased after treatment by factors of 4to 16 in these animals.
                    Macrofilaricidal activity was incomplete in 2 of 6 group C animals (1 and 3
                    adult worms recovered). Parasite antigen titers remained elevated after
                    treatment in these animals, and they did not clear their microfilaremias. Thus,
                    CGP-20376 was effective as prophylaxis against L3 and L4 of B. malayi in jirds.
                    Macro- filaricidal efficacy was greater than 90% relative to adult worm
                    recoveries in untreated jirds. Parasite antigen levels reflected drug efficacy
                    as determined by parasitological examination, but antigen clearance was
                    incomplete in some cases after apparently successful treatment of mature and
                    immature infections.</p>

                    carried out in 1987 and 1988 in Banfora (Burkina Faso, West Africa) in order to
                    determine the effect on birth weights of chloroquine chemoprophylaxis during
                    pregnancy. 756 women treated with chloroquine sulfate were compared to 708
                    controls without treatment.</p>
                <p>In spite of a true effect of chloroquine in preventing placental infection (5.1%
                    infected placentae in the treated group versus 18.9% in the control group), mean
                    difference of birth weights between the 2 groups (18 g) was not significant,
                    neither was the proportion of low birth weight new-born babies (LBW) (16% versus
                    16.7%). In contrast, a strong relation between placental infection and birth
                    weight was observed : the mean birth weight difference between infected and
                    non-infected placentae was 116 g and the proportion of LBW was 25.7% versus
                    14.1%.</p>
                <p>This relatively small increase in birth weight obtained in addition to the poor
                    acceptance of prophylaxis by the population and the spreading of
                    chloroquine-resistant Plasmodium strains should be considered before extending
                    malaria chemoprophylaxis to all pregnant women.</p>

                <p>La fréquence des manifestations cliniques et sérologiques de la toxoplasmose a
                    été évaluée chez 241 greffés de moëlle et interprétée en fonction du statut
                    sérologique du donneur et du receveur avant greffe. 11 cas de toxoplasmose grave
                    ont été observés chez les receveurs ayant une sérologie positive avant greffe et
                    correspondent à des rechutes d'une infection ancienne; 10/11 sont survenues chez
                    des malades ayant reçu la moelle d'un donneur séronégatif. Les manifestations
                    cliniques sont avant tout neurologiques, et surviennent entre le 2 ème et le 6
                    ème mois après greffe (moy. 96 jours). Le diagnostic a été porté par l'aspect
                    scannographique et la résolution sous traitement dans 4 cas, par la mise en
                    évidence du parasite dans 3 cas, et post mortem dans 4 cas. Au cours de la
                    toxoplasmose, la sérologie est restée à un titre stable dans 4 cas et a diminué
                    dans 7 cas. Aucun cas de toxoplasmose grave n'a été observé chez les receveurs
                    négatifs avant greffe; le risque lié à la survenue d'une primo-infection (3 cas)
                    semble négligeable, de même que celui de transmission de parasites avec la
                    moelle d'un donneur seropositif.</p>
                <p>Le suivi sérologique effectué au minimum trois mois chez tous les malades (plus
                    de six mois chez 185), a permis plusieurs observations: a) chez 72% des
                    receveurs négatifs, on observe une positivation transitoire de la sérologie dès
                    le premier mois, due à la transmission passive d'anticorps. b) chez les
                    receveurs positifs, la sérologie se négative dans 43% des cas, mais des rechutes
                    sérologiques sont fréquentes; le plus souvent cliniquement latentes, elles sont
                    observées chez 27% des malades, en moyenne 15+7 mois après la greffe et
                    pourraient être considérées comme un signe de reconstitution immunitaire des
                    receveurs.</p>
                <p>Ces résultats montrent l'importance du bilan sérologique avant greffe chez les
                    donneurs et receveur afin de définir le risque potentiel de toxoplasmose. Chez
                    les receveurs positifs, la fréquence élévée des toxoplasmoses graves nous
                    conduit à proposer une chimioprophylaxie du 2ème au 6ème mois après greffe.

                    fois/semaine) peut etre proposé, en raison de l'efficacité de cette association
                    et de sa bonne tolérance chez les greffés de moëlle.</p>

                    Chloroquine resistance, prevention In December 1988, nineteen young adults
                    participated in a field research tour in the area of Tillaberi, 100 km from
                    Niamey, along the Niger river. Seven of them had P.</p>
                <p>falciparum malaria within 14 days after their return to France. The patients had
                    taken regular chloroquine prophylaxis as confirmed by adequate plasma levels
                    measured on admission. Drug sensitivity test using a radioisotope microdilution
                    method were performed on three patients isolates, revealing in vitro resistance
                    to chloroquine.</p>
                <p>This is the first report of chloroquine resistance from Niger. Epidemiological
                    and biological data obtained from the seven patients were compared to those of
                    the 12 healthy subjects. There was no difference between the 2 groups in terms
                    of age, weight, sex and blood levels of chloroquine. However, infected
                    individuals were found to have spent significantly more time in surrounding
                    villages than in Tillaberi, implicating a possible difference in the duration of
                    exposure to infecting anopheles. These results motivated various changes in
                    preventive measures including reinforcement of pre-departure informa- tion on
                    malaria, use of repellent impregnated bed nets and presumptive treatment of a
                    suspected malaria episode. These measures were then applied for the three
                    subsequent groups which left for the same area and stayed under the same
                    conditions as the previous one. No Suspected nor proven cases of malaria were
                    reported from these groups and fur- thermore, malaria serology remained
                    negative.</p>

                    undertaken as part of the Kilombero Malaria Project, the aim of which is to
                    determine risk factors of malaria in the Kilombero District in southern
                    Tanzania.</p>
                <p>During and after last year's high transmission season (May-July) 693 persons were
                    in- vestigated for malaria parasites. Their infection rate was estimated by
                    assessing their level of anti-sporozoite antibodies by ELISA. Urinary
                    chloroquine level was measured concurrently by thin layer chromatography.</p>
                <p>Overall, 43% of all individuals had some chloroquine in their urine, and 15% had
                    high concentrations of chloroquine, suggesting that these individuals had used
                    chloroquine recently. Chloroquine uptake was clustered by household. Thus in
                    many households, no chloroquine was used, and in other households everyone had
                    taken chloro%uine recently.</p>
                <p>Chloroquine usage was independent of age and was not correlated with infection
                    rates.</p>
                <p>Prevalence of infection and parasite densities were not significantly affected by
                    chlo- roquine usage, although parasite density tended to be slightly higher in
                    individuals with no chloroquine in their urine than in chloroquine users.</p>
                <p>These results suggest that any obtained chloroquine might be distributed among
                    members of the household, which would result in the observed clustering between
                    households and in sub-curative doses. The implications of such a pattern for the
                    evolution of chloro- quine resistance will be discussed.</p>

                <p>Diarrhea - Intestinal Diseases, Parasitic - Refugees Diarrhoea is still one of
                    the main causes of mortality in children under 5 years in Africa. For the last
                    decade, large campaigns have been promoted by W.H.0O.</p>
                <p>and U.N.I.C.E.F. to decrease diarrhoea mortality through the extended use of Oral
                    Rehy- dration Salts (0.R.S.), for the treatment and the prevention of
                    dehydration. In Refugee camps, due to factors such as over-crowding,inadequate
                    water supply,lack of sanitations, epidemics of diarrhoea are quite frequent.
                    However,in a well established settlement of Ethiopian refugees in Sudan, where
                    the conditions have improved, reducing the detrimen tal effects of the above
                    factors, diarrhea remained one of the main mortality causes in children. In
                    order to establish an effective control programme to reduce morbidity and
                    mortality, adapted to the local situation, we studied the causes of diarrhoea in
                    163 children attending the clinic in one camp, in july 1987. Each child was
                    examined (temperature, clinical signs, weight, height }), and a stool test was
                    performed on the spot (direct &amp; MIF). Clinically, 34.3% of the children had
                    an associated disease (ARI, malaria). Dehydration was present in 11 (6.6%)
                    children, 38 (23.3%) had a weight for height index &lt;80%. In 153 children,
                    stool test were positive,showing the following: Giardia Trophozoiïites: 26
                    (15.9) and Cysts:22 (13.4%); Entamoeba Histolytica Trophozoi- tes: 10 (6.1%) and
                    Cysts: 5 (3.06%); H. Nana: 8 (4.9%); Trichuriasis: 2 (1.2%); T. Sa- ginata: 1
                    (0.6%). 50 (30.6%) of the stool samples showed the presence of numerous red and
                    white blood cells. After 3 days of treatment, condition improved in 64 (39.9%)
                    of the children. As a result, treatment guidelines have been drawn up, with
                    emphasis on O.R.S. use for prevention and treatment of dehydration, and
                    recommending to perform a stool-test if the condition of the child did not
                    improve 3 days after the visit.</p>

                    ni la chloration,l'action de l'ozone sur leur viabilité a donc été testée. Pour
                    ce faire,des oocystes de Cryptosporidium parvum provenant de selles fraiches de
                    chevaux parasités,après mise en suspension en quantité connue dans 100 ml d'eau
                    déminéralisée,ont été soumis à différentes conditions d'ozonation.Après
                    neutralisation de l'ozone résiduel,la totalité des oocystes a été administrée

                    100% des rats est obtenue après ingestion d'un minimum de 104 oocystes non
                    ozonés.Aucune excrétion n'a pu être mise en évidence après ingestion de 107

                    qui signifie qu'en fonction des conditions d'ozonation pratiquées,103 à 104
                    oocystes au moins ont perdu leur viabilité et que l'ozonation utilisée en
                    désinfection terminale dans le traitement des eaux est susceptible d'inactiver

                    partir de 1984, puis en Afrique de l'Ouest depuis 1987, a incité à protéger les

                <p>Parasitemia and mortality were studied in lactating and not lactating mice (kept
                    in anoestrus during all the experiment), infected with 200.000 T.cruzi blood
                    trypomastigotes (Tehuantepec strain).</p>
                <p>Lactating mice, infected either on the first or the tenth day post-partum, showed
                    significant cumulative survival rates of respectively 20 and 33% on the end of
                    the expe- riment, whereas infection was lethal for all the age-paired non
                    lactating control mice.</p>
                <p>A11 mice died in the acute phase of the disease, but both lactating groups get
                    signifi- cant longer survival times than the control mice (20-21 days vs. 15
                    days post-infection).</p>
                <p>The lactating mice died with a maximum mean parasitemia x 5 more higher than the
                    con- trol ones. Moreover, surviving mice from both lactating groups displayed
                    mean maximum parasitemia similar to that found in dying control mice.</p>
                <p>Such results point out higher resistance to T.cruzi infection in lactating mice,
                    which are able to support extremely high parasitemia, usually lethal in
                    non-lactating mice.</p>
                <p>So, lactation in mice does not improve the control of infection, but only limits
                    its lethal effect. This raîses the question of the physiological modifications
                    (hormonal ?) which, during lactation, are able to induce such an anti-lethal
                    protective effect.</p>

                    hydatidose, Maghreb, prévention L'hydatidose constitue un problème de santé
                    publique en Tunisie. La mise en place de sa prévention nécessite
                    l'identification préalable des Con- naissances, Attitudes et Pratiques liées à
                    la maladie. Pour ce faire, une enquête a été réalisée dans un foyer
                    hyperendémique situé en Tunisie Cen- trale (Sisseb, taux d'incidence
                    chirurgicale:200/100 000/an, taux de pré- valence échotomographique: 3,5%). Sur
                    les 320 ménages de ce foyer, 643% connaissaient le cycle du parasite parmi
                    lesquels 90% rapportaient des mesures de prévention adéquates. 70% des ménages
                    savaient reconnaitre les abats parasités; parmi ces ménages, 9% seulement
                    rapportaient des mesures de prévention adéquates. L'hospitalisation avait un
                    impact puisque les ménages comportant un sujet antérieurement opéré pour
                    hydatidose connais- saient mieux que les ménages sans ancien opéré le cycle du
                    parasite (78% contre 68%) et les mesures de prévention (83% contre 62%). Par
                    contre, l'hospitalisation n'avait pas d'impact sur le changement des pratiques
                    liées à la transmission du parasite puisque l'on n'observait pas de diffé- rence
                    entre les deux groupes. Les résultats de cette étude ont incité les autorités
                    sanitaires à développer des campagnes d'éducation dans la popu- lation générale

                    Ecdysteron, Lamblia duodenalis Ecdysteroids are hormones of moulting events in
                    insects. It is known they exert a killing effect on some species of Protozoa. In
                    this context we studied the influence of the most widespread ecdysteroid -
                    ecdysteron on spontaneous infection of rabbits with L. duodenalis. Ani- mals
                    weighing 3-3,5 kg were maintained under common conditions. During 3 monthes 20
                    rabbits were administered per os with ecdysteron in the do- se of 5 mg/kg;
                    control group involved 20 rabbits. After this term anim- als were decapitated.
                    The fact and intensity of protozoal infectioe were estimated by identification
                    of L. duodenalis in scrapping of duodenal mu- cosa. It was shown that the number
                    of infected with L. duodenalis rab- bits was well below in the group obtaining
                    ecdysteron (P 0,05). The re- vealed phenomenon can be accounted for by the
                    direct inhibitory effect of ecdysteron or its metabolites on L. duodenalis or by
                    the adaptogenic effect of ecdysteron on macroorganism increasing the nonspecific
                    resis- tance to various exogenic fectors including protozoal infection, 466 S4.D

                    antigens (Pf11.1 and Pf155/RESA) which like Ag332 comprise repeated sequences
                    containing regularly spaced pairs of glutamic acid. The epitope specificity was
                    examined by measuring the antibody reactivity with sequentially overlapping
                    heptapeptides. The fine specificity of mab 33G2 was investigated by measuring
                    the antibody reactivity with single amino acid substitutions. When testing the
                    reactivity of 33G2 with the peptide ESVTEEIA and all possible single amino acid
                    substitutions, the first two amino acids (E and S) as well as the last (A) were
                    shown to be completely replaceable. The two adjacent glutamic acid were
                    important for binding while V, T and I were replaceable with amino: acids
                    displaying similar chemical properties. This indicates that the reactivity of
                    mab 33G2 is focused to the linear sequence VTEEI. The possibility to replace
                    amino acids within the epitope with resembling amino acids explains the ability
                    of 33G2 to recognize recombinant proteins and peptides corresponding to repeated
                    sequences of Pf11.i and Pf155/RESA.</p>
                <p>Studies were also made with polyclonal human antibodies, affinity purified on
                    peptides corresponding to Ag332-repeats. These antibodies, which also inhibited
                    merozoite reinvasion in _ vitro, reacted with a similar epitope as mab 33G2.
                    This B-cell epitope could be of interest for a potential malaria subunit
                    vaccine.</p>

                <p>Toxoplasma gondiiis responsible for congenital toxoplasmosis that can lead to
                    abortion or to severe neonatal malformations. It has now gained additional
                    interest because it can cause severe complications and death in AIDS patients.
                    Antibodies against T.gondii confer only partial protection against challenge
                    with the parasite and cell-mediated immunity is thought to be a major factor in
                    host resistance. However, the antigens involved in eliciting the protective
                    T-cell response have not been defined.</p>
                <p>Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCSs) from chronically infected donors were
                    shown to be highly responsive to in vitro stimulation with tachyzoite lysate
                    antigen (TLA) as measured by incorporation of $H-Thymidine and gamma interferon
                    (IFN-y) production. Two fractions of TLA obtained by preparative SDS-PAGE
                    containing the antigens of 60 to 85 kDa and 10 to 27 kDa respectively induced a
                    significant proliferative response of PBMCs. Among the major surface antigens of
                    tachyzoites, affinity purified by monoclonal antibodies (22, 30, 35 and 43 kDa),
                    only the 30 and 35 kDa molecules were able to stimulate the lymphocytes.</p>
                <p>To analyse the population of T-cells that proliferate after antigenic stimulation
                    by TLA, responding cells were grown in human recombinant interleukin-2
                    containing medium and cloned in the presence of phytohaemagglutinin, allogeneic

                <p>High levels of resistance to infection with Dirofilaria immitis can be induced in
                    dogs following vaccination with irradiated infective larvae (Wong et al., 1974).
                    To date, neither the antigens responsible nor the immunological mechanisms
                    involved are known. We have undertaken a longitudinal study of the immune
                    response to parasite extracts and to cloned D. immitis proteins, which include
                    paramyosin and a surface- associated, excretory/secretory antigen (D5), during
                    the course of vaccination and subsequent challenge.</p>
                <p>Specific IgG responses to adult worm antigens and D5 were detected after 6 weeks
                    in vaccinated dogs. Antibody levels then generally increased and peaked around
                    challenge. Following challenge à rapid increase in the response to D5 and adult
                    worm antigens was observed. The antibody response to paramyosin was negligible
                    during this period. Control dogs showed a slight increase in response to adult
                    worm antigens after challenge but no response to either of the cloned antigens.
                    Immuno-blot analysis demonstrate the appearance of several unique bands in
                    vaccinated dogs both pre- and post-challenge. In addition, eosinophilia was
                    detected in all dogs and was more pronounced after challenge.</p>
                <p>We are continuing the analysis of the humoral response, including that of other
                    1g classes and subclasses, throughout the rest of the infection. We are also
                    comparing the lymphocyte responses of vaccinated and control dogs to the various
                    antigens. In addition we are increasing the repertoire of cloned D. immitis
                    antigens to use in the study.</p>

                    surface antigens of Plasmodium yoelii sporozoites were systematically studied
                    throughout the exogenous cycle in Anopheles stephensi by western blot and
                    immunofluorescence techniques. Antigens were detected with previously
                    characterized monoclonal antibodies designated NYS1, NYS2, NYS3, NYS4 and NYS5.
                    The first 3 mabs recognize the CS while NYS4 recognizes a 140 kD antigen (SSP2)
                    and NYS5 a high molecular weight antigen (230 kKD) SSP3. AI 3 antigens were
                    detected by both techniques. Using IFAT the CS could be detected in oocysts on
                    day 5 postinfection whereas the other 2 antigens first appeared in oocysts on
                    day 8. Similar results were obtained by western blot, although a delay of 2 days
                    occured before SSP2 and SSP3 could be detected by this technique. An interesting
                    observation was the IFA reactivity of NYS5 with the midgut of both infected and
                    uninfected mosquitoes forming a lattice shaped net on its surface. This suggests
                    presence of a common determinant between the parasite and the mosquito. NYS1
                    stained 4 bands on the strain as reported previously ; however, when cloned
                    parasites were used only two bands appeared to be recognized, suggesting : that
                    the strain is in fact a mixture of at least 2 parasites distinct as far as the
                    NYS1 determinant (CS protein) is concerned.</p>

                    larvae/mouse of T.spiralis s.str. (Tl), T.nativa (T2), Trichinella sp.3 (T3),
                    T.pseudospiralis (T4) and T.nelsoni (T7). 28 days post infec- tion, ten mice of
                    each group received 75 ug/mouse of one of the TI-T/7 muscle larvae antigen. The
                    criteria for evaluating different responses were both anaphylaxis (circu- latory
                    collapse and severe blood volume loss) and death in each group of mice
                    tested.</p>
                <p>80-1007 of the infected mice, injected with the corresponding parasite antigen,
                    showed circulatory collapse and 40-907 died, while less thar 757 of the mice
                    injected with one of the other TI-T/7 parasite antigens showed circulatory
                    collapse and less than 40% died. These data show the existence of distinct

                    partly purified and used in an ELISA to test for the presence of antibodies in
                    plasma from malaria- immune individuals. Antibodies to the protein was found in
                    most of the African donors and not in Danish control donors. T-cells from a high
                    proportion of malaria immune donors proliferated when exposed to this antigen,
                    whereas T-cells from only a small proportion of the non-immune donors
                    proliferated. According to Southern blot analyses, PCR-studies and sequencing of
                    a cloned PCR-amplificate, the repeat is present and appears conserved in the 12

                <p>Malaria; Antigenic Variation Several species of malaria parasites are known to
                    undergo antigenic variation during the asexual erythrocytic cycle. Recrudescent
                    parasites of P.chabaudi in NIH mice have been shown to be antigenic variants of
                    the initial, cloned, infecting population. P.chabaudi is a good model to study
                    antigenic variation in malaria. Parasite clones from a recrudescent population
                    have been tested in a triple layered indirect fluorescent antibody test on live,
                    schizont-infected erythrocytes, using a panel of hyperimmune sera raised against
                    each cloned population. This has shown that not only are these recrudescent
                    clones antigenically different from the initial parent population, but that some
                    vary antigenically from each other and also appear to vary in their
                    immunogenicity.</p>
                <p>The course of infection of these antigenically distinct recrudescent clones has
                    been followed, showing differences in terms of peak parasitaemias and period of
                    subpatency between the primary and recrudescent parasitaemias. Parasites have
                    been collected during remission and recrudescence of these infections. These are
                    being analysed using the panel of hyperimmune sera in the indirect fluorescent
                    antibody test on live, schizont infected erythrocytes, which can show
                    differences between individual parasites within these populations. This will
                    indicate when, during the course of infection, variant parasites arise, and show
                    how the recrudescent populations themselves vary antigenically during
                    infection.</p>

                    and the search for a potential antifilarial vaccine are complicated by three
                    main features of the parasite.</p>
                <p>These are the strict specificity for the humanhost; the unknown relationship
                    between specific immune responses and pathology; and the broad spectrum of
                    disease manifestations which range from asymptomatic infection to severe skin
                    pathology and visual impairment.</p>
                <p>The primary objectives of our collaborative research programme with the MRC
                    Laboratory in Bo, Sierra Leone are to analyse humoral and cellular processes
                    involved in the immune response of patients presenting with defined clinical
                    conditions and the identification and molecular cloning of antigens against
                    which such responses might be directed.</p>
                <p>Attention is being focussed on antigens that are expressed at the surface of the
                    different life-cycle stages of the parasite.</p>
                <p>Using human infection sera, monoclonal antibodies and rabbit hyperimmune sera,
                    studies have progressed towards the identification, cloning and expression in
                    Escherichia coli of Onchocerca volvulus antigens likely to be associated with
                    the surface of the parasite; an antigen that shares homologies with the

                <p>Dictyocaulus viviparus, excretory-secretory antigens, host heterogeneity The
                    excretory-secretory (ES) products of the pathogenic adult stage of the cattle
                    lungworm Dictyocaulus viviparüs were immunochemically characterised. The
                    antibody response to these following natural infection and vaccination with
                    irradiated larvae was studied by radio-iodination, immunoprecipitation and
                    SDS-PAGE.</p>
                <p>Vaccination was found to induce an antibody response of different specificity
                    from natural infection. Moreover, heterogeneity in the specificity of the
                    antibody response was observed between individual cattle. The cause of this
                    individual var iability was investigated using inbred guinea-pigs, which showed
                    that the immune response to D. viviparus ES antigens is under genetic
                    control.</p>
                <p>At the biochemical level, proteinase activity was detected in adult ES, which may
                    contribute to the pathology associated with lungworm infection. The antibody
                    response to such activity may therefore protect sensitised hosts against lung
                    damage and also impair parasite survival. The response to adult ES antigens thus
                    provides information regarding host heterogeneity in immunity and
                    immunopathology.</p>

                <p>The authors try to detect antigen susceptible to be protective. One
                    characteristic of this antigen is to be early detected and during all the
                    infestation by all the isotypes. So they have infected orally 120 mice in.order
                    to reproduce a natural infection. Then they studied by immuno-western-blotting
                    the kinetics of target antigens recognized by IgG, IgM and IgA toxoplasmic
                    murine antibodies. The first antigen which appaered is the 35 kDa devoted to
                    IgM, 7 days after oral infestation.</p>
                <p>Three days later other antigens are also recognized (24, 29, 32 kDa). The 35 kDa
                    is detected too by IgG and IgA but 14 days post-infection. During the chronic
                    phase (more than one year post-infection) the 35 kDa antigen is also constantly
                    recognized by IgG and IgM and irregularly by IgA, when these, antibodies are
                    present.</p>
                <p>In conclusion the 35 kDa protein seems to be a good candidate for a protective
                    antigen, because it is a constant and an early target antigen during a natural
                    infection in mouse.</p>

                    coccidian parasite, usually occurs via the oral route. Secretory IgA antibodies
                    are considered to be protective against intestinal coccidiosis throught
                    inhibition of cell penetration by the parasite and of its subse- quent
                    intracellular development. Oral infection of mice with T. gondii induces
                    specific secretory IgA synthesis in the gut. T. gondii specific antibody
                    responses in serum, intestinal secretions and milk were identified using an
                    ELISA following a single oral infection of mice with 76K strain cysts. IgA
                    production began during the second week of infection in serum and milk, during
                    the third week of infection in intestinal secretions and in all three, persisted
                    throughout the experiment (18 weeks). I1gG, but not IgM anti- bodies were
                    detected in intestinal secretions late on in infection. Serum and milk IgG and
                    IgM production began at the same time after infection as the IgA response. Using
                    Western blotting, the intestinal IgA antibodies were shoun to react with
                    antigens co- migrating with the T. gondii proteins p22, p23, p30, p43, the 28kDa
                    antigen and 55-60 kKDa rhoptry proteins as recognized by specific monoclonal
                    antibodies. The milk IgA antibodies reacted with antigens co-migrating with p30
                    and p43. Characterization of the role of such antigens in local protective
                    immunity is a prerequisite for future oral vaccination studies.</p>

                    first by monoclonal antibodies (Leish 65) and the second in immunoprecipitation
                    experiments using sera of vaccinated individuals (Leish 97). The Leish 65
                    antigen (MW around 65 kDa) was isolated in immunoaffinity collum with monoclonal
                    antibodies while the Leish 97 antigen (MW around 97 kDa) in nitrocellulose

                    intravenous route and 50% when innoculated subcutaneously. Several doses were
                    tested, ranging from 2 to 100 ug of Leish 65 and protection was observed on dose
                    above 20 png. A protection of 25% was observed when mice were immunized

                    two antigens were combinated (Leish 65 + Leish 97 innoculated subcutaneously) a
                    level of protection of 70% was achieved. It's also important to note that the
                    size of the lesions in the vaccinated but non-protected mice was about ten times
                    smaller than in control ones.</p>

                    inter- val, followed by challenge two weeks later with 200 live unattenuated
                    cercariae led to 78% protection as compared to unimmunized control mice. In
                    order to identify the molecu- les that induce protective immunity in this model,
                    individual sera of immune mice were reacted in Western blots of soluble adult
                    worm antigens (SAWA) and Nonidet P40-solubilized whole adult worm antigens
                    (NP-WAWA). This led to the detection of the protein bands that are targets of
                    antibody responses. However, since T cell immunity controls antibody production,
                    on the one hand, and on the other, might be critical of its own in anti-
                    Schistosoma mansoni protection, the veritable immunogens are the ones inducing T
                    cell (and preferably also B cell) immunity. Therefore, the SAWA and NP-WAWA
                    protein bands recognized by mesenteric lymph node T lymphocytes of immune mice
                    were identified in T cell Western assays. A map of S. mansoni SAWA and NP-WAWA

                    peripheral blood T lymphocyte proliferation in T cell Western assays. The study
                    identified, for the first time, the molecules carrying human T cell epitopes in
                    S. haematobium eggs. These molecules are probably the ones inducing

                    IgA/IgE antibody response - target antigens The antibody response to Toxvplasma
                    gondii was investigated äin rat and mouse models after infection or
                    immunization. The IgA antibody response was particularly studied since the
                    contamination by this parasite is usually acquired by oral route. A kinetic
                    study showed that the IgA antibody response of infected rats appeared at day 7
                    and reached its maximum level at day 40. In mice, similar kinetics were
                    obtained. The IgA antibodies were mainly directed against soluble and membrane
                    antigens of 28.5, 29, 30, 35, and 38 kDa in infected rats and against the 29 kDa
                    antigen in infected mice. Moreover, in orally infected rats, an intense IgE
                    antibody response against P30, the major tachyzoite surface antigen was
                    observed. Among the tachyzoite excreted-secreted antigens, infected rats
                    recognized 28.5 and 34 kDa molecules, but infected mice recognized the 34 kDa
                    antigen only.</p>
                <p>Immunization with excreted-secreted antigens induced a significant IgA antibody
                    response in rats, even in the absence of adjuvant; this response was mainly
                    directed against 28.5 and 34 kDa antigens. IgA antibodies thus appear as a
                    prominent and early component of the immune response to T.gondii; the IgA
                    antibodies could play an essential function either in inducing protection or as
                    blockina antibodies.</p>

                <p>A mouse (CR:NIH:S) model system was elaborated for studying humoral and cellular
                    immune reactions to the infection with a Giardia lamblia clone (GS/M-83-H7).
                    This clone had been previously defined regarding its major surface antigen (a
                    polypeptide of Mr 72kD) by the binding of a monoclonal anti-body G10/4.
                    Similarly to findings in infections of humans and gerbils the Gijardia-clone
                    undergoes antigenic variation during the course of infection in mice. Infections
                    peaked 2-3 weeks after inoculation and were selfcured by day 42 p.i.. The
                    proportion of trophozoites expressing the initial M 72kD surface antigen was
                    decreased by day 12 and almost totally absent by day 22 p.i.. The predominant
                    humoral parasite-specific response was an IgM isotype which was directed to the
                    original Mr 72kD surface antigen as well as other antigens. T-lymphocytes
                    (predominantly L3T4+) isolated from Peyer's patches showed a significant
                    proliferative response to Giardia lamblia antigen from day 12 p.i. and later.
                    Spleen and lymph node cells showed no lymphoproliferative response. T-cell blot
                    analysis revealed the presence of dominant T-cell epitopes in the areas of Mr
                    200K - 75kD and &lt;50kD poly-peptides, no response was demonstrated in the Mr
                    72kD region (migration site of the major surface antigen), suggesting T-cell
                    dependent mechanisms are most likely not responsible for the surface antigen
                    switch which occurred during the course of infection.</p>

                    S. mansoni, is a major health problem in subtropical countries and major efforts
                    are being made to define a vaccine. In this regard, we have reported that sera
                    from subjects with low susceptibility to infection by S. mansoni react with a
                    major larval surface antigen (P-37) of Mr 37 kDa against which sera of
                    susceptible individuals show little reactivity.</p>
                <p>We have now cloned the cDNA for this antigen by screening a schistosome cDNA
                    expression library with antibodies against the purified protein. The selected
                    cDNAs encode a protein that is specifically identified by immune human sera
                    containing antibodies against P-37 while sera exhibiting low or no reactivity
                    toward P-37 fail to recognize the recombinant protein. The cloned cDNAs
                    hybridize with a 1.2 kb RNA that is the transcript of a single copy gene. This
                    RNA directs the synthesis of a 36.5 kDa polypeptide that is precipitated by sera
                    from the most resistant subjects. The amino acid sequence of the encoded
                    polypeptide shows homology with the glycolytic enzyme glyceraldehyde-3-P-
                    dehydrogenase (72.5 % of positional identity with human GAPDH).</p>
                <p>Antibodies against the recombinant protein identified P-37 on the larva.</p>
                <p>These findings together with other reports indicate that a number of conserved
                    proteins are major targets of host protective immunity against S. mansoni. The
                    hypothesis is discussed that genetic restriction of the immune response to these
                    antigens may occur in heterogenous human populations because of the limited
                    number of T-cell epitopes carried by these host-like proteins. Such genetic
                    effects might allow parasite transmission through non responder (susceptible)
                    individuals.</p>

                    Because vaccination with crude oncosphere extracts gives complete protection
                    against infection, we attempted to identify one or more antigens with the hope
                    that they could be prepared subsequently on a commercial scale using recombinant
                    DNA methods. Solubilisation and ultracen- trifugation of oncosphere antigens in
                    à range of detergents did not destroy the immunogenicity of the extracts;
                    enabling analysis of antigen fractions prepared by isoelectric focussing and
                    electrophoresis. The relevance of antibody in host protective immunity was
                    established by maternal transfer and passive transfer experiments.
                    Immunoblotting analysis of antigens using immune sheep sera identified two
                    groups of potential antigens with relative mobilities of 31-34 kDa and 45-50
                    KkDa and isoelectric point of 5.8. The immunogenicity of antigens with these
                    character- istics was confirmed by vaccination trials using fractions cut from
                    agarose IEF gels and from SDS polyacrylamide gels. Affinity purified antibodies
                    prepared against the candidate antigens were used to screen a cDNA library and

                <p>The assay was an adaptation of that used by Heath and Lawrence 1981 (Int. J.
                    Parasit. 11, 261-266).</p>
                <p>Cultures were established in 24-well plastic culture plates in a humidified CO:
                    incubator. A culture consisted of 0.5 ml of test sheep serum previously heated
                    to 60°C for 30 min, 2 ml of CMRL 1066, 100 activated oncospheres and 20 lil of
                    normal sheep serum collected aseptically and in a manner to preserve complement
                    activity, and stored in liquid N°. After 24 h, the percentage of lysed
                    oncospheres was determined in a sample of 100 per culture, viewed with an
                    inverted microscope. A set of sera collected from immunized sheep prior to
                    challenge infection gave a range of oncosphere lethality that was directly
                    related to necropsy results. For further work, the test was adjusted each time
                    to accurately reflect the immune status of the range of known sera. Test sera
                    could then be compared within and between experiments. Protective antigens could
                    be identified by absorbing lethality from sera using nitrocellulose blotted with
                    antigen.</p>

                    Trichinella spiralis - phosphorylcholine - immune response Phosphorylcholine
                    (PC) containing components are detectable in many pathogenic microorganisms. The
                    PC epitope is highly immunogenic, antibodies to this hapten are present in sera
                    of hosts after infection with these microorganisms. There is not much
                    information about possible functional aspects of PC epitopes on parasitic
                    components nor about the kind of linkage between PC and these components.</p>
                <p>The purpose of this study is to characterize PC containing antigens in T.spiralis
                    by biochemical and immunological techniques. PC containing antigens are found in
                    all life stages of T.spiralis. They are not exposed on the surface nor excreted
                    secreted, yet antibodies to them are among the first to be detected after an
                    infection. Under physiological conditions PC containing antigens are aggregated
                    with other immunogenic T.spiralis specific antigens. They could be isolated free
                    from these components in high salt buffers. Though a PC containing antigen
                    fraction isolated by affinity chromatography induced high levels of immunity in
                    mice, a purified PC containing antigen of 37 KD did not, implicating that PC in
                    this combination did not play a major role in the induction of immunity. Passive
                    transfer of monoclonal antibodies to PC neither induced significant protection
                    in mice.</p>
                <p>Chemical and enzymatical studies showed that PC is bound onto the 37 KD component
                    via N-glycosidic linked carbohydrate side chains.</p>

                <p>Schistosoma - surface antigens - vaccine - molecular biology Previous studies
                    have shown that the tegumental surface membranes of adult Schistosoma z“ansoni
                    contain antigenic polypeptides of M.8-200K. The focus of our group is to clone
                    nd characterise these antigens. This paper describes our work on the 22K
                    antigen. By cereening an adult S. mansoni lambda gt-1l library with rabbit
                    anti-sera raised against highly-purified tegumental membranes, 14 cDNA clones
                    were isolated and found to encode a “- 22K protein. Western blotting with
                    antibodies specific for this protein has shown it to be absent in eggs and
                    cercariae but present 1h after transformation to schistosomula.</p>
                <p>In addition, this protein is present in 8 other species of Schistosoma and is not
                    sex- specific. Unlike the other tegumental membrane proteins, the 22K protein is
                    peripherally associated with the surface membrane, predominantly soluble and
                    unglycosylated.</p>
                <p>Analysis of its sequence shows no homology with any known sequences in the EMBL
                    database.</p>
                <p>Northern blot studies indicate that the mRNA encoding the 22K protein is at least
                    10 times more abundant than any of the other tegumental antigens. The 22K
                    protein has now been expressed in the expression vector pGEX-2T and is being
                    used for vaccination trials in mice.</p>

                <p>The definition of antigens which are targets of the various host immune responses
                    of animals to coccidia required further studies. Our first attempts to obtain
                    monoclonal antibodies against the sporozoite stage of Eimeria falciformis from
                    spleen of previously infected mice consistantly led to antibodies belonging to
                    the IgM isotype.</p>
                <p>In order to produce more diversified monoclonal antibodies, mice were injected 6
                    times with 106 sporozoites with a resting period of three months between the
                    third and the fourth injections. The spleen cells were fused with SP20 mouse
                    myeloma cells in the presence of polyethylene glycol and hybrid cells were
                    grown, selected and subcloned according to previously described procedures.
                    Culture supernatants where screened by ELISA using first sporozoite homogenates
                    then glutaraldehyde treated sporozoites as antigen. Six cloned hybridomas were
                    selected and injected into pristane primed mice to produce ascites tumors. These
                    six monoclonal antibodies gave similar surface fluorescence patterns by indirect
                    immunofluorescence assays. When tested for their isotypes, 4 of them were from
                    the 1gG1 and 2 from the IgG2, subclass. These monoclonal antibodies recognized
                    antigens from 80, 40 and 20 Kd. The two 1gG2, antibodies screened particularly
                    interesting since only IgG2, antibodies participated in the in vitro
                    phagocytosis of sporozoite by immune macrophages. We are now trying to
                    demonstrate that these two monoclonal antibodies are active in this process.</p>

                    sera, were detected upon scre- ening with each kind of serum and analyzed
                    independently. Both were composed by the same 114 bp repetitive sequence coding
                    for a 38 aminoacid repetition : PQEE(E/Q)EDVGPRHVDPDH FRSTTQDAYRPVDPSAYKRAL.
                    This sequence shares &gt; 60% homolgy with the one reported T.brucei microtubulè
                    associated protein (MAP). Anti-JL9 activities were present in sera of 12 out of
                    19 chagasic patients and very high titers were obtained with 6 out of the 19 pa-
                    tients. Anti-Jl9 antibodies used to probe epimastigotes westerh blots bound to a

                    Moreover, anti-K1.7 antibodies recognized 45, 68 and 120 KD proteins from
                    trypomastigotes. Northern blot of epi-mRNA showed that the JL9 protein is
                    encoded by a 8kB mRNA. In order to purify the antigenic peptide K1.7, we have
                    cloned the T. cruzi DNA sequence in pMSgt11 and the re- combinant protein was

                    uninfected controls were positive.</p>
                <p>Antigen was first detected around 34 days after primary infection.</p>
                <p>Early detection of antigen depended on the number of infective larvae inoculated
                    in to the cats. Even though a positive correlation was observed between
                    microfilaraemia and circulating antigen levels, preliminary evidence suggests
                    that female adult worms are the major source of antigen. Parasite antigens were
                    isolated from infected cat by affinity binding. SDS-PAGE and Immunoblotting
                    identified two antigens. In this paper we have discussed about the follow up of
                    circulating antigen for 90 weeks in the cats repeatedly infected with B.pahangi.

                    (Legrand et ak., 1987).</p>
                <p>We already confirmed that this 72 kDa surface component is different by peptide
                    digestion profile from the gp63 of Leishmania donovani chagasi (L.d.c.).</p>
                <p>35 sera from bolivian patients suffering from cutaneous and mucocutaneous
                    leishmaniasis recognized predominantly the 72 kDa antigen. The intensity of the
                    band corresponding to the 72 KDa antigen was independent of the antisera title,
                    of the clinical manifestation and of the geographic origin of the patient. On
                    the opposite, sera from visceral leishmaniasis children dit not precipitate the
                    72 KDa glycoprotein.</p>

                <p>Both shared common antigenic determinants inasmuch as monospecific antibodies
                    which recognized the ampiphilic labelled proteins reacted with the hydrophilic

                    their peptide digestion profiles and by the fact that both displayed proteolytic
                    activity at neutral ph, as proved by zymogram assay.</p>

                    - vaccination - protective antigens Meriones unguiculatus (jird) were vaccinated
                    with irradiated L3 of A.viteae and antigers recognized by challenge resistant
                    animals were characterized with monoclonal antibodies. Vaccination with 1,2, or
                    3 doses of 50 irradiated L3 resulted in protection against challenge of &gt;90%.
                    The protection lastet for at least 6 months. As little as 5 irradiated L3
                    induced measurable protection. Immunization with culture supernatant of L3
                    resulted oäin 58.1% protection. The antigen predominantly recognized by sera of
                    vaccinated jirds is a glycosilated protein of 205 kD present in the oesophageal
                    glands of L3. MAbs against this molecule recognize a 26 kD protein of uterine
                    microfilariae which induces antibody responses in chronic A.viteae - infections.
                    The 205 kD and the 26 kD molecule share a variety of biochemical and
                    immunological properties indicating that they are products of the same gene.
                    Antigens with similar properties which are recognized by our mAbs occur also in
                    Onchocerca volvulus, Brugia malayi and Ascaris suum, but not in trematodes and
                    cestodes. We suppose that the 205/26 KkD antigen of A.viteae induces protective
                    antibody and T cell responses in early / chronic infections, thus con- tributing
                    to reduction of superinfections.</p>

                    larval stages of filarial parasites are considered prime target molecules for
                    immunoprophylaxis since they are in contact with the host environment and are
                    presumably within range of antibody and cellular immune responses. O. volvulus
                    L3 and L4 larvae (1-3 days, 5 or 10-12 days after molting)were 125 I-labelled
                    using Iodogen and the labelled components were extracted with SDS + ME and
                    analyzed by SDS-PAGE Comparison of the surface components of L4's 1-3, 5 or
                    10-12 days after molting indicated that there is no significant difference in
                    the surface- labelled components of the 3 different stages. Thus, confirming our
                    ob- servation that the morphology of the epicuticle and cuticle of L4 during in
                    vitro culturing is the same. Immunoprecipitation , with antibodies from
                    immunized chimpanzees or infected humans and chimpanzees, of LA surface-labelled
                    proteins in comparison to L3 surface-labelled proteins have enabled us to
                    identify stage-specific antigens. The L4 specific antigens are 66, 92 and 103 kd
                    polypeptides. The L3 specific antigens are the 72, 39, 36, 16, 14, and 12 kd
                    polypeptides. Analysis of meta- bolically labelled proteins of L3 and L4 have
                    identified a 22 kd antigen specific to L4 and 36, 38 kd polypeptides synthesized
                    specifically in L3 before molting. These observations have enabled us to
                    identify molecules for further studies of larval stage-specific immunogens.</p>

                    100,000 deaths annually. Since chemotherapy has been ineffective at controlling
                    ascariasis, we are engaged in the development of methods of immunotherapeutic
                    intervention into the disease. These studies encompass both an exploration of
                    the immune responses to Ascaris antigens and the identification of potential
                    vaccine candidates. We describe here our studies with the major Ascaris
                    allergen. We have isolated the major allergen from Ascaris body fluids and
                    purified it to homogeneity by high performance liquid chromatography. The
                    allergen (named ABA-1) appears to be a dimer (of approximately 25 kDa) in its
                    native state which resolves as a putative monomer of approximately 10 kDa on
                    gradient SDS-PAGE. Up to 507 protection has been obtained in preliminary
                    vaccination experiments in mice with the HPLC purified dimer. Amino acid
                    sequencing of the N-terminus (first 32 amino acids) has enabled us to construct
                    an oligonucleotide probe for cDNA screening and to follow the expression of the
                    allergen during development. Supported by Alberta Heritage Foundation for

                    availability of an effective irradiated lar val vaccine. Efforts are now being
                    concentrated on the identification of the important immunising antigens of this
                    parasite for future vaccine developments. We have examined the exposed sur face

                    with the aid of fluorescence techniques.</p>

                    revealed a fundamental alteration in surface lipid characteristics following

                <p>Recently, human volunteers vaccinated by P. falciparum sporozoites exposed to a
                    higher irradiating dose (20 to 23 krad) than that used in previous human studies
                    (12 to 15 krad) did not appear to be protected upon challenge with non
                    irradiated sporozoites, despite apropriate antibody response to sporozoite
                    antigens. We investigated in-vitro the fate of P. falciparum sporozoites exposed
                    to the same irradiating doses. Results demonstrate clearly that the rate of
                    penetration in human hepatocytes is inversely correlated with the irradiating
                    dose. At 14 krad, the dose which enabled to induce protection in former
                    experiments, about half of the number of LS found without irradiation was
                    obtained. At 21 Krad the dose which did not confer protection in man, the number
                    of LS obtained compared to controls was only 7 %.</p>
                <p>The same assay was also performed using P. yoelii (17X-NL strain) sporozoites
                    with Balb C mouse hepatocytes. Penetration and transformation to young LS
                    in-vitro was reduced compared to controls using 10 Krad exposed sporozoites, and
                    was close to 0 when sporozoites were exposed to 20 Krads.</p>
                <p>In-vivo mice immunized with 10 Krad sporozoites were protected, while those
                    receiving 20 and 30 Krad sporozoites were not.</p>
                <p>Taken together these findings strongly suggest that the presence of infected
                    liver cells is required to achieve protection. In turn this may reflect that
                    antigens expressed at the LS level and not those harboured by sporozoites are
                    responsible for triggering the species-specific protection achieved.</p>

                <p>Sporozoites of malaria parasites elicit a humoral response directed mainly
                    against the repeat region of the circumsporozoite (CS) protein. We investigated
                    whether sporozoites can induce antibody responses against epitopes outside the
                    repeat region and whether these antibodies have any biological significance. To
                    this aim, serum samples from Saimiri sciureus boliviensis monkeys immunized with
                    irradiated Plasmodium vivax (Sal I) sporozoites or with recombinant proteins
                    (rPvCS-1, rPvCS-2, rPvCS-3) representing different segments of the Sal I strain
                    CS protein were used.</p>
                <p>Post-immunization sera were tested for their ability to recognize sporozoiîtes
                    from a strain of P. vivax (NV 247) characterized by a different CS protein
                    repeat region.</p>
                <p>All sera from monkeys immunized with irradiated sporozoites and some from animals
                    immunized with CS recombinant proteins containing long amino-acid stretches
                    outside the repeat region did inhibit (85 to 100%) the NV 247 strain liver stage
                    development in primary cultures of Saimiri monkey hepatocytes. The same sera
                    recognized a 56 and 66 Kda doublet on NV 247 strain sporozoite extracts. No such
                    inhibition or recognition occurred with sera from animals immunized with a
                    recombinant protein encoding only the repeat region of the Sal I strain. Such
                    data suggest that a biologically relevant immune response may be directed toward
                    conserved regions outside the repeat portion of the P. vivax CS protein.

                    Our cloning strategy relies on the following hypothesis : antigens from

                    or secreted (ES) appear as good vaccine candidates in Toxoplasmosis (1, 2).
                    According to this idea, a monoclonal antibody raised against ES antigens and
                    recognizing a 28.5 kD glycoprotein both in the dense granules of tachyzoites and
                    bradyzoites and in the intravacuolar network (3) was used to screen a tachyzoite

                <p>exo-erythrocytic schizonts, cell-mediated immunity Elegant evidence has indicated
                    that Circum-Sporozoite Protein-specific, CD8+ T cell clones are induced by
                    irradiated sporozoites, and under appropriate conditions can protect mice
                    against sporozoite challenge. However, it is not known whether Class I
                    associated determinants of other proteins expressed by ee schizonts can induce
                    similar protective T cells. We have found indirect evidence suggesting that
                    newly synthesized proteins of the ee schizont are important in the protection
                    induced by irradiated sporozoites. Thus the expression of PbLl, a liver-stage
                    specific determinant that we have identified with monoclonal antibody, decreases
                    with increasing irradiation doses applied to sporozoites. This decrease is
                    reminiscent of the decrease in immunologiïcal protection induced by sporozoites
                    with increasing irradiation doses.</p>
                <p>Our MAb to PbLIl has identified a gene insert in an ECOR1* genomic library.
                    Fusion protein has been derived by electro-elution of an SDS-PAGE preparation of
                    GTill expressed in Y1090 E. coli in semi-solid agar. Antisera to this fusion
                    protein reacts with ee schizonts and also apparently with a determinant
                    expressed on the parasitoph- orous vacuolar membrane of blood stage parasites.
                    Neither the identifying MAb nor the polyclonal antisera prevents blood stage
                    infection from sporozoite challenge, though both antibodies may exert some
                    opsonizing effect on merozoite bunches emerging from rupturing hepatocytes.</p>
                <p>This gene insert will be subcloned in an appropriate plasmid to enable production
                    of mg amounts of protein, as well as sequence information. Epitope(s)
                    appropriately packaged with Class I histocompatibility antigen on suitable

                <p>Leishmania donovani; recombinant proteins Monjour and collaborators have reported
                    that a semi-purified antigen (LiF2) of infective Leishmania donovani
                    promastigotes is capable of inducing protection in mice (Balb/C and C57B1/6)
                    against L. major and L. mexicana infection. Protective immunity coincided with
                    the presence of monocytes/marcrophages and serum with parasiticidal effects.
                    Similar neutralising antibodies have been detected in vaccinated dogs. These
                    antibodies have been used to screen an L. donovani lambda gt11 CcDNA library. By
                    differential immunoscreening, three clones (8b2, 3al and 3b2) were isolated that
                    were recognised by sera from vaccinated dogs and mice but not by sera from
                    unvaccinated animals. The preliminary characterisation of these clones and
                    corresponding recombinant fusion proteins, which might be of interest for

                    tively immune" endemics (Ward et al., 1988). In order to study differences in
                    antibody responses by these defined groups, OV cDNA libraries were screened with
                    pooled sera. Two clones, OI5 &amp; OI13, were selected using pooled sera from
                    the putatively immune group. All individual sera from that pool recognized both
                    cloned antigens in Western blot analysis, whereas only 11 &amp; 26% of infection
                    sera recognized OI5 &amp; OI3 antigens, respectively. DNA sequencing revealed
                    that OI5 (0.7kb) &amp; OI3 (1.4kb) encode overlapping portions of the same gene.
                    Both clones have been overexpressed as fusions with the E.coli maltose bind- ing
                    protein (NEB MBP vector system). OI3 is very lysine rich at its carboxy terminal
                    and has no homology to previously published proteins. Sera generated against

                    antigens will enable us to further examine the preferential recognition of this
                    protein by putatively immune individuals. 013 also contains at least 1 T-cell

                    candidates as vaccines in view of the importance of anaphylactic antibodies in
                    resistance to infection. We have characterized three independant lambda Jti1
                    cDNA clones (3.2, 3.3 and 3.13) that produce fusion proteins recognized by IgE
                    antibodies in both rat and human infection sera. The first of these , 3.2,
                    contained a 2553 bp insert that has been completely sequenced and corresponds to
                    a nearly complete copy of paramyosin. This molecule has been described as a
                    target of cell-mediated immunity in the mouse model and à partial copy of the
                    gene was previously obtained (Lanar D. et _ al, Science, 234, 593-596, 1986).
                    The second clone, 3.3, contained a 1300 bp insert and the predicted amino acid
                    sequence shows high levels of homology to vertebrate and invertebrate myosins
                    but was not identical to the partial S. mansoni myosin sequence previously

                    infected by different geographical isolates of Schistosoma mansoni. Eggs of S.
                    mansoni are known to initiate an immune-mediated granuToma formation in host
                    tissues.</p>
                <p>The objectives of this study were to determine whether there were any differences
                    among egg antigens of different geographical isolates and to assess their
                    serological cross- reactivities. Soluble egg antigens (SEAs) of S. mansoni from
                    Puerto Rico (PR), Republic of South Africa (RSA) and Eastern Caprivi (EC) were
                    prepared by an optimized method and their protein profiles determined using

                    however, the 27K component which was evident in the PR isolate was absent in
                    both the EC and RSA isolates. Immunodiffusion precipitin arcs of all SEAs showed
                    varying regions of identity, partial identity and non-identity. There are

                <p>Parasite-specific antibodies were present in BAL and appeared to be qualitatively
                    different from serum antibodies in their recognition of parasite antigens. 2D
                    analysis of IEF gels showed the presence of several proteins (in both acidic and
                    basic regions) ranging from 14-275 kDa molecular mass. There were several
                    similarities and dissimilarities between the 2D patterns of proteins from
                    different stages of the parasite. Immunoblot analysis showed that BAL antibodies
                    from day 32 post infection (pi) recognized more than eight proteins (14-240 kDa)
                    from adult worms and four proteins (20- 75 kDa) from L4. However, proteins from

                    measured in 329 Gambian children aged 3 to 8 years. Malaria morbidity
                    surveillance was carried out for all children for a period of six months during
                    the following malaria transmission season and immune responses were compared
                    with subsequent susceptibility to infection, high parasitaemia and clinical
                    symptoms.</p>
                <p>Immunological measurements were repeated in some children at the end of the
                    transmission season and, at the same time, an age cross- sectional study, of 255

                    The existence of protective antigens common to various parasites has been
                    previous- 1y pointed out. The present paper describes the identification of
                    Fasciola hepatica protein antigens that cross-react with Trichinella
                    spiralis.</p>
                <p>Two IgGl monoclonal antibodies, ES/TA2 and EC/TA3, respectively developed against
                    excretory-secretory products and crude extract of T. spiralis Li larvae, were
                    used in an ELISA sandwich ‘and vestem blot analysis. These monoclonal antibodies
                    were selected for its low cross-reactivity with a broad range of parasite
                    antigens.</p>
                <p>In the ELISA sandwich, using crude extracts of F. hepatica adults and T. spiralis
                    L1 larvae, the optical density values were respectively 0.45 and 0.81 with
                    EC/TA3, and 0.35 and 1.4 with ES/TA2. By western blot, ES/TA2 revealed two
                    doublets of approximately 60 and 68 kD in the crude extract (CE) of F. hepatica
                    adults and nothing in the excretory-secretory (ES) products of this parasite,
                    whereas EC/TA3 recognised a doublet of 30 KD in the ES products and nothing in
                    the CE.</p>

                <p>Much interest has been focused on a 140 Kd antigen released from mature schizonts
                    recognized by human immune sera and found to induce partial immunity in monkeys.
                    Responses to the antigens of T lymphocytes from fifty adults who recovered from
                    a confirmed P. falciparum attack 2 weeks to 2 years before the study were
                    analysed using proliferation assays. Using overlaping recombinant proteins
                    portions of SERP-I (i.e. n°7 and 10) containing T-cell epitopes were identified
                    using both polyclonal T lymphocytes and T-cell clones. Interestingly,
                    preliminary T-cell epitope predictions were in good agreement with experimental
                    findings. Overlaping synthetic peptides corresponding to sequences of protein
                    n°7 were synthetized. Although T-cell responses to synthetic peptides were
                    comparatively low, two peptides were consistently recognized by T cells from
                    about 25% of doñofs : peptide n°3 (SNYPYNYVKVGEQCUP) and peptide n°6
                    (LHNKNEPNSLDGKLY). These two peptides were recognized altogether by the same
                    donors. The significance of these findings is underlined by the low level of
                    response of T lymphocytes from non sensitized donors to the recombinant proteins
                    or peptides.</p>

                    recognized by sera from patients and dogs with visceral leishmaniasis which have
                    potential for use as diagnostic reagents of this disease, were further
                    characterized.</p>
                <p>Analysis by ELISA, protein blotting and immunoprecipitation confirm that these
                    proteins are present in both the amastigote and promastigote stage of the
                    parasite. Variation in the Mr of both proteins was observed between the
                    different isolates of L. donovani. When additional leishmanial species were
                    examined, lower M.W. proteins (64 and/or 68 kDa) vere found to react with a
                    monoclonal antibody against the 72 kDa protein, but not with D2, a monoclonal
                    antibody to the 70 kDa antigen. The basis for the microheterogeneity of 72 kDa
                    is still unclear and does not appear to be due to glycosylation. The 70 kDa
                    antigen is glycosylated.</p>
                <p>Preliminary studies in Balb/c mice have shown that immunization with pure dp72
                    (12 ug) with Corynebacterium parvum as adjuvant gives a reduction in the

                    still unclear. Future experiments may reveal the mechanisms involved in the

                    caproni provides an useful model for study of mechanisms of concomitant
                    immunity; mice are resistant to reinfection and the parasite develops without
                    obscuring tissue migration in the qgut (Christensen et a1.1986). The change in
                    susceptibility of developing worms to immune re- jection has been examined with
                    respect to expression of carbohydrates on the tegument surface. In vitro
                    excysted worms and juveniles were im- planted intraduodenally into mice which
                    had been immunized by a previous infection and rates of worms being able to
                    establish were recorded.</p>
                <p>Newly excysted worms and juveniles kept in RPMI-1640 medium up to 24 hours are
                    not able to establish in recipient mice, whereas juveniles taken from donor mice
                    at 1,2,6 and 24 h p.i. gradually become resistant against immune expulsion.
                    Concurrently, the juveniles secrete a carbo- hydrate matrix onto their
                    plasmamembrane. The surface coat ‘and the te- gument contain glycoconjugates
                    which differ from parenchymal saccharides in their peculiar binding capacity for
                    the lectins SBA and WGA. The glycoconjugates are synthesized in the perikarya
                    and are transported in electron lucent vesicles to the surface. The
                    glycoconjugates were iden- tified as molecules of apparent high molecular mass
                    by SDS-PAGE and pro- bing blots with lectins. The results suggest a role of
                    glycoconjugates in mechanisms of immune evasion.</p>

                    immunisation The range of antigens (mRNA in vitro translation products)
                    immunoprecipitated by serum from an inbred mouse strain during S. Mansoni
                    infection has been shown to vary with both genetic background and MHC haplotype.
                    Variation between strains has been investigated in more detail with respect to
                    the antibody response to an 86 kilodalton antigen (p86) which is under
                    MHC-restricted control. Following immunisation with antigen preparations
                    containing the entire antigen, or defined fragments of p86, the capacity to
                    raise an antibody response is also observed to vary between strains. The
                    capacity to respond is influenced by the presence or absence of adjuvant, and
                    the presence or absence of particular portions of the entire antigen.</p>
                <p>Detection of antibody responses using two different assays (immunoprecipitation
                    and Western blot analysis) reveals that in some instances, apparent antibody
                    non-responsiveness is due to MHC-restricted differences in the fine specificity
                    of the antibody response. Thus, while immunisation with selected fragments of
                    p86 was able to generate an antibody response in each of the strains failing to
                    respond following immunisation with the entire antigen, results suggest that
                    overcoming genetic restriction may alter the fine specificity of the expressed
                    antibody response.</p>

                    Schistosome - surface antigens - vaccination -- molecular biology We have shown
                    that a purified preparation of the tegumental membrane of adult Schistosoma
                    mansoni (mb-S) can induce up to 60% immunity in mice when given with saponin as
                    an adjuvant. Solubilization of mb-$S in octylthioglucaside, CHAPS or DOC does
                    not destroy its immunogenicity, and a protective fraction has been identified
                    after passing the solubilized mb-S through a Sephacryl S-300 column. Antibody
                    analysis of sera from väaccinated mice by immunoprecipitation and Western
                    blotting, suggests that low M.</p>
                <p>proteins are involved in protection, particularly a M; 25K molecule. Several low
                    molecular weight proteins have been isolated from mb-S by affinity chromtography
                    and the genes encoding some of these molecules have been cloned, sequenced and
                    expressed.</p>

                    stages of Plasmodium berghei derived from irradiated sporozoites (EErads) were
                    cultured in vitro in HepG2 cells. The EErads were found to synthesise a large
                    repertoire of antigens, predominantly but not exclusively those expressed by
                    normal early EE schizonts. Following invasion, over half of the intracellular
                    sporozoites, both normal and irradiated, appeared to die. After 24 hours, in
                    marked contrast to the normal parasites, EErads continued to break open shedding
                    their antigens into the cytoplasm of the infected host cells. Increasing
                    radiation dosage has previously been shown to reduce the irradiated sporozoites'
                    ability to protect animals, and the dosage correlated with reduced de novo
                    antigen synthesis by the EErads.</p>

                    21040 - Rio de Janeiro - RJ - Brasi S. mansoni - vaccine - protective antigens
                    On the search for antigens which mediate protective immunity against
                    schistosomes, we re ported previously the use of a "cocktail" of schistosome
                    components (SE) released fromii ving S. mansoni adult worms incubated in PBS.
                    Since SE could elicit significant resistan ce in two different hosts, it
                    appeared worthwhile to characterize this antigen mixture in terms of protein
                    composition, and to correlate the presence of these proteins with their location
                    in the worm body. In a first approach, several monoclonal and polyclonal antibo
                    dies specifically recognizing distinct cytoskeletal proteins and enzymes were
                    applied on immunoblot into SE resolved proteins, and immunocytochemistry on
                    frozen sections of adult worms. As cytoskeletal elements, we evidenced
                    paramyosin (and its breakdown products), a 59-60 kDa cytokeratin and
                    actin-immunoreactive bands. Regarding enzymes, we detected the 28 kDa
                    glutathione-S-transferase, cathepsin B and haemoglobinase. Moreover, heat shock
                    protein (70 kDa) was also detected in SE. As regards the presence of these
                    proteins in the worms, the distribution pattern of paramyosin in adult worms
                    confirmed previous data, with an immunireactive network at the integumental
                    level as well as in the subjacent mus cle layer. Cytokeratin labeling (as
                    assessed with a polyspecific anti-keratin serum) cor responded to a filamentous
                    network in the tegument of both male and female. Interestin - gly, the tuberculi
                    were strongly labeled with this antibody. Haemoglobinase and cathepsin B were
                    mainly detected in the worm gut, with a labeling pattern of large homogeneous
                    pat ches. In contrast, the localization of HsP 70 revealed a spot pattern
                    scattered in the muscle layer of the worm body. Our data, clearly show that SE
                    is partially composed of cy toskeletal elements and enzymes, distinctly located
                    in the worm. It remains to be determi ned which pathways are involved in their
                    release into SE, and to precise their differen- tial role in convevine the high

                    evades host immunity is poorly understood.</p>
                <p>To study this question, the surface components of adults, mf, eggs, and infective
                    larvae (L3s) were compared. Radioiodination followed by SDS-PAGE and
                    autoradiography of surface components immunoprecipitated with patients’ sera
                    revealed at least 20 polypeptides distributed unevenly among the developmental
                    stages. À 31 KDa antigen was skin mf specific, whereas antigens of 25 and 67.5
                    KDa occurred on females, but not male cuticles. A glycosylated antigen of 68 KDa
                    was shared by all other stages studied except eggs and L3s. An 18.5 KDa
                    glycoprotein antigen seemed to be specific for L3 cuticles. Glycoprotein
                    antigens of 45 and 75 KDa were identified on the egg shells only.</p>
                <p>IFAT with specific antisera revealed Type VI collagens on skin mf, Type IV
                    collagens on males and laminin on nodular mf. The presence of stage specific
                    antigens and the coating of worm stages with host- like antigens probably
                    contribute to the evasion of host immunity and the survival of 0. volvulus in

                    glutathione S-transferases (GSTs) have assumed a major immunological interest.
                    The recombinant 28 kDa GST from Schistosoma mansoni (Balloul J.M. et al, Nature,
                    326, 149-153, 1987) conferred a significant level of protection in rats, mice,
                    hamsters and baboons. We have now characterized and cloned an S. mansoni 26 kDa
                    GST isoenzyme (Sm 26 GST). The full-length polypeptide sequence shows extensive
                    homology to an S. japonicum 26 KkDa GST (Smith D.B. et al, Proc Natl. Acad. Sci.
                    USA, 83, 8703-8707, 1986) and, to a lesser extent, to mammalian class u GST
                    isoenzymes. No significant homology to Sm 28 GST was noted, apart from a
                    relatively conserved region probably involved in the common properties of these
                    enzymes. À comparison of the tissue distributions of Sm 26 GST and Sm 28 GST by
                    immunoelectron microscopy indicates a similar localization in the tegument and
                    subtegumental parenchyma, but a major difference in the protonephridial region
                    which suggests that Sm 26 GST may be actively excreted by the worms. The latter
                    has now been efficiently expressed in E. coli and purified by affinity
                    chromatography. Investigations are currently directed towards determining the
                    potential of recombinant Sm 26 GST as a component of a defined multivalent
                    vaccine against schistosomiasis.</p>

                    The clearance of the parasite was accompanied by a gradual increase in IgA and

                    enhanced GLSA 56 antibodies. Our data, indicated that prior immunization with

                    of the glutathione-S-transferases (GSTs) as a protective agent against

                    affinity chromatography yielded two protein species of 26 and 26.5 KkD, which
                    may be resolved into 10-11 components by 2D gels. The suspected heterogeneity of
                    the Fh GSTs was confirmed by the reactivity of four monoclonal antibodies to
                    discrete GST subsets. The differing specificities of these antibodies were
                    utilized in immunoelectron microscopy studies of GST expression in adult and

                <p>N-terminal sequencing of the GSH binding proteins of F. hepatica revealed two

                    from the proteolytic digests of Fh GST showed homology to either schistosome of
                    rodent GSTs. However, the isolation of peptides of near identical but variant
                    sequences reflects the extensive heterogeneity of the Fh GSTs and implies the

                    purified on the Mr 23,000 - Mr 25,000 integral membrane protein fraction of the
                    parasite. This antigen (referred to as Sm23) is immunogenic in infected humans
                    as well as in rabbits exposed to S. mansoni. The protein sequence of the antigen
                    as deduced from cloned DNA sequences is 218 amino acids long and contains four
                    putative transmembrane regions. Of particular significance, Sm23 is strikingly
                    similar, with respect to both amino acid sequences (36% identity) and putative
                    domain structure to ME491, a molecule first identified as a human stage-specific
                    melanoma-associated antigen, and now thought to be a cell surface receptor for
                    an unknown growth factor.</p>

                <p>The technique of T Cell Western Blotting was used to evaluate the
                    lyaphoprolifera- tive response in_ vitro induced by different fractions of
                    Leishæania (L. mexicana mexicana) antigens in patients with either of the three
                    major clinical foras of American cutaneous leish@aniasis: localized (LCL:11
                    patients), mucocutaneous (MCL:7) and diffuse (DCL:3). The proteins were
                    separated by SDS-PAGE at 10% and transfered to nitrocellulose (NC) paper, after
                    which particulate antigens were prepared by treataent with DMSO. Fourteen
                    different antigenic fractions from 10 to 200Kd were separated. Both LCL and MCL
                    patients responded to a heterogeneous group of frac- tions over all the range of
                    molecular weights. However, it was possible to deter- mine that LCL patients
                    responded preferentially to two fractions (22-28 and 28-37 Kd) that gave the
                    strongest responses in almost all of them. À similar pattern was demonstrated
                    for MCL patients (54-62 and 95-127 Kd). À significant result is that DCL
                    patients, who are characterized by an absence of response in _ vivo and in_vitro
                    to total leishmanial antigen, #ere able to respond to a fraction of 19-22 Kd
                    that induced a strong proliferative response in vitro in these patients. This
                    suggests that these patients do not lack entirely a cellular iaaune response to
                    Leishmania antigens, as was previously believed. Our results will be discussed
                    in teras of the application of this technique to characterize potential antigens
                    that can be use as candidates for a future vaccine.</p>

                    excretions and secretions of schistosomes in-vivo elicit a dominant antibody
                    response in schistosomiasis infection. In-vitro culture of adult Schistosoma
                    mansoni, in chemically defined medium (RPMI- 1640), has been employed to isolate
                    excretory-secretory proteins (ESP).</p>
                <p>For comparison, soluble worm extract proteins (SWAP)of S. mansoni was prepared.
                    ESP and SWAP were tested for cross-reactions with sera from schistosomiasis
                    patients and from S.mansoni infected mice (4th - 12th week post infection). ESP
                    and SWAP were separated by homogenous and by sodium-dodecyl
                    sulphate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and assayed in immunoblots for
                    reaction with individual sera. One- and two-dimensional immunoblots showed a
                    differences between proteins (antigens) in ESP and SWAP. Al1 infected sera
                    consistently recognized a bands in immunoblots of molecular weight of
                    approximately 28, 37 and 57 Kilodaltons(KD). Human sera had,in addition,
                    antibodies against ESP of 18KD, and against SWAP of 40 and 90OKD. Sera from
                    infected mice (8th week) had recognized proteins of 18 and 62KD in ESP.</p>
                <p>The data indicate that ESP and SWAP had a common protein antigens identical in
                    the molecular weights and electrophoretic mobility and recognized by their
                    antibodies in immunoblots of schistosomiasis infected sera. These common
                    proteins constitute homologous family of specific antigens and may be applied
                    for the immunodiagnosis of schistosomiasis mansoni.</p>

                    nana infection-Infant mice We revorted previously that when 1-week-old
                    uninfected mice were subcutaneously inoculated with shell-removed eggs of
                    Hymenolepis hana, they could completely reject cysticercoids from subsequent
                    oral challenge infection with the eggs at 3 week of age. In the present
                    experiments we searched for a possibility of tolerance induction using a
                    criterion that the combination of subcutaneous and oral challenge infections
                    stated above (referred to as "SC-PO 2-pulse system" afterwards) is established,
                    that can be confirmed by the presence of intestinal cysticercoids from the
                    challenge infection. As pretreatment for inducing the tolerance, uninfected ICR
                    mice were subcutaneously inoculated at birth with eggs of Hymenolepis nana,
                    Hymenolepis diminuta or Hymenolepis microstoma( 5000 eggs each per mouse). Using
                    these pretreated mice and controls(non-treated) subsequent "SC-PO 2-pulse
                    system" was conducted to know whether the criterion is established or not. In
                    control mice, any cysticercoid was not found in the small intestine, while
                    mature cysticercoiäs were found in some mice(50-70 % in total experimentals)
                    pretreated with eggs of any of these species. These results suggest that as far
                    as investigated by using the criterion stated above, there would be,to some
                    extent, induced tolerance to the Hymenolepis nana infection by the pretreatment
                    with eggs of these Cestoda.</p>

                    To test whether immune adults from different parts of Africa might share the
                    ability to agglutinate intact P. falciparum-infected erythrocytes from multiple
                    isolates, we tested sera against 4 West African (Gambian) and 3 East African
                    (Tanzanian) isolates. 42 sera of adults from diverse areas of Africa (The
                    Gambia, Tanzania, Nigeria, Ghana, Sudan) as well as 17 sera from other malaria
                    regions (Colombia, Irian Jaya, Indonesia) were tested. Except for the Colombian
                    donors who were not immune, the other sera are assumed to be from malaria-immune
                    individuals. The majority of sera from African adults agglutinated all 7 African
                    isolates at 1:5 serum dilution. Some sera from Irian Jaya also agglutinated all
                    of the African isolates, however their agglutination titer was significantly
                    lower. To study the time-course of acquisition of pan-agglutinating antibodies
                    in à population from a malaria-endemic region, we analyzed sera from 90 Gambian
                    individuals collected over five consecutive years (1970-1974). The donors ranged
                    from 1 year old to 50 years on year 1. All sera were tested for aggiutination at
                    1:5 dilution against 4 Gambian isolates. Some children of 3-4 years developed
                    pan-agglutinating antibodies, however, the majority of individuals of 3 years
                    exhibited isolate-specific but not pan-specific antibodies. In contrast, 80% of
                    individuals of 6-7 years old were pan agglutinating.</p>
                <p>Detailed analysis of this survey will be presented, together with indirect
                    measurements of malaria-immune status (infection rate, spleen and liver
                    enlargement, blood hemoglobin). Our results are consistent with the concept that
                    antibodies that agglutinate PRBC contribute to naturally acquired protective
                    immunity.</p>

                    eliminates 90-987 of Trichinella spiralis larvae in immune rats. Protective
                    antibodies are present in immune serum and will induce rapid expulsion of T.
                    spiralis in normal adult rats that have previously been transfused with OX8-
                    OX22- T helper cells. Reaginic antibody was isolated by affinity chromatography
                    from immune serum collected 28 days after the primary infection using mouse
                    anti-rat mAbs A2 &amp; B5 consecutively. As little as 175 ug of purified immune
                    IgE (1:640 titre by PCA against T. spiralis muscle larvae) was effective on a
                    per rat basis. Th cells were isolated from thoracic duct lymph by affinity
                    chromatography and panning on petri dishes to 807 purity and containing 5% B
                    cells. Neither cells nor serum were effective by themselves. Th célls could be
                    transferred 1-7 days prior to IgE and still elicit rapid expulsion. In naturally
                    infected rats expressing rapid expulsion the serum PCA titre had fallen by 2-3
                    months to a level that precluded isolation of sufficient IgE for transfer. At
                    these time points a non-IgE antibody is able to mediate rapid expulsion. These
                    experiments demonstrate 1). that serum IgE in actively immune rats can mediate
                    rapid expulsion without the involvement of other antibody isotypes; 2). other
                    serum antibody isotypes can also mediate rapid expulsion without a need for the
                    involvement of IgE.</p>

                <p>This work was carried out to study the antigenicity of some stages of
                    S-haematobium in groups of patients infected with this parasite. The groups
                    chosen were Iraqi,Egyptians and Sudanese patients. Three fractions of an Iraqi
                    strain of Se_haematobium were used: Soluble worm antigen(SWA),soluble egg
                    antigen(SEA)and fresh whole eggs as an antigen(FWE). The antigenicity of the
                    first two fractions was determined by the assessment of the radioaotively
                    labelled antigens recognised by antibodies in patient sera using the
                    immunoprecipitation test(IMP)and of thé third by oiroumoval precipitin
                    test(COPT). Of the three studied groups of patients Iraqis showed the highest
                    reactivity with SWA and FWE. The mean percentage reaotivi- ty of SWA was less
                    than that of SEA for all groups pf patients. Thus, SEA is the most likely source
                    to induoe immunopreoipitation with patient sera. No direct correlation between
                    the reactivity of the patient sera and the egg output in urine ie. intensity of
                    infection was noted in any of the antigens used. The percentage sensitivity of
                    COPT using FWE was higher than that of IMP with SWA and SEA (95.64 versus 71%
                    and 85.9%)whereas the paroentage speoificity was relatively low for all the
                    three antigens (61.8% versus 44.1% and 44,2%). It is oonoluded that of the three
                    antigens selected FWE gave the best promise for diagnosis when used ân the COPT.
                    SEA was more sensitive than SNA. However, none of the antigens could be used to
                    measure the intensity of infection no matter what test is employede S5S.B5

                    up to 8 weeks p.i. The infection persisted with an average establishment of
                    7.1+2.2 worms. The total worm biomass/mouse increased up to 4 weeks p.i. but was
                    significantly lower from 5-8 weeks p.i. À super- imposed infection of 10
                    cysticercoids of H. microstoma 4 weeks after à primary infection did not survive
                    1 week after challenge but had no effect on the present primary infection
                    (concomitant immunity). Both the number of PEC'S and the dry weight of the MLN,
                    PLN and spleen increäsed signifi- cantly 2 weeks - but not 1 week - after the
                    infection and reached a maximum 4 or 5 weeks p.i.</p>
                <p>It is concluded that a CMI-response might play a role in the reduction of weight
                    of the primary worms after 5 weeks infection and in the complete immunity to
                    superimposed infections. The effects of MLN+PLN-cells and PEC's © antibodies on
                    Hymenolepis-species - in vitro and in vivo - should be investigated.</p>

                    University, Ithaca,NY 14853 Trichinella, antibodies,intestine, immunity,
                    antigens Rat pups suckling Trichinella spiralis infected dams express intestinal
                    immunity against infectious muscle larvae. This immunity, called rapid
                    expulsion, is mediated by anti- bodies conferred to pups in milk. We sought to
                    identify the target antigens of these protective antibodies. To this end, a
                    panel of protective and non-protective rat 1 monoclonal antibodies were
                    characterized in immunoprecipitation experiments using I labelled
                    excretory-secretory (ES) antigens as well as surface antigens prepared from
                    muscle stage larvae.</p>
                <p>Protective antibodies precipitated a family of ES molecules. Non-protective
                    antibodies precipitated molecules from this same family but failed to bind the
                    45 kd species.</p>
                <p>Surface antigens also were differentiated by the antibody panel. The majority of
                    pro- tective antibodies precipitated four proteins 105, 97, 55 and 51 kd.
                    Non-protective antibodies precipitated only the 97 and 51 kd proteins. In
                    addition, two protective antibodies shared the later specificity. These results
                    were compared with results obtained by fluorescent antibody staining of intact
                    larvae. This comparison revealed that those antibodies able to bind the surface,
                    regardless of their particular surface antigen specificity, and to the 45 kd
                    protein of ES, were protective. Thus, the mechanism of rapid expulsion may
                    involve direct binding of antibodies to the parasite surface or interaction with
                    one member of an antigenic protein family in ES.</p>

                <p>Using a commercially available purified arc-5 antigen, we examined the in vitro
                    lymphoproliferative responses of hydatid patients and healthy controls. Antibody
                    levels of different immunoglobulin classes were also measured against the same
                    antigen, in sera of both groups. Our findings indicate that lymphocytes from
                    healthy control do not proliferate to the arc-5 antigen whereas lymphocytes from
                    the majority of patients do.</p>
                <p>The negative or weak responses observed among few patients were found neither to
                    be due to increased release of prostaglandins in culture nor to a lack of
                    responsiveness to Interleukin-2. Antibodies of all 3 classes G, M and A measured
                    by an ELISA were elevated in sera of patients as compared to controls. However,
                    levels of specific IgG antibodies only gave an excellent discrimination of the
                    disease state and were of important diagnostic value. No direct or inverse
                    correlation between lymphoproliferative responses and antibody levels could be
                    noticed in either group although few patients with relatively low antibody
                    titers demonstrated very high proliferative responses.</p>

                <p>Filariasis-IgG subclasses-Cat-Brugia The cat infected with Brugia pahangi is a
                    good experimental model for human filariasis. We have isolated and described
                    three subclasses of IgG from the cat. The subclass responses of infected cats
                    have been further studied by western blotting and ELISA using various life-cycle
                    stage antigens of B.pahangi.</p>
                <p>The total IgG levels in sera rose from 12.l mg/ml in normal cats to 17.4 mg/ml in
                    microfilaraemic cats (mf+ve). Immune, amicrofilaraemic (mf-ve), cats had the
                    highest levels at 22.3 mg/ml. The ratio of the subclasses IgGl+IgG2:1gG3 was 6:1
                    in mf+ve cats and 2:1 in mf-ve cats. Both western blotting and ELISA show an
                    increased recognition of Brugia antigens by the IgG3 isolated from immune cats
                    compared to that from mf+ve cats. : Our studies show that the IgG3 response of
                    cats infected with B.pahangi is very sensitive to change during the
                    transformation from the mf+ve to mf-ve state and is a good indicator of the
                    development of resistance.</p>

                    cell-mediated activity was tested in the course of experimental trichinellosis.
                    B6C3F1 mice were infected with 500 larvae of T.spiralis per mouse and cytotoxic
                    activity of pulmonary NK cells was assayed in vivo 10, 20, 30, and 60 days
                    thereafter. This activity was sub- stantially elevated on days 20 and 30 but not
                    on days 10 and 60 post infe- ction. Stimulation of the antineoplastic function
                    of NK cells in murine lungs was accompanied by elevated numbers of large
                    granular lymphocytes (LGL) and asialo-GMi-positive cells isolated from spleens
                    of the infected animals. In addition, expression of Thy1, CD4, and CD8 antigens
                    was marke- dly enhanced on splenocytes obtained from mice inrected 30 but not 20
                    days earlier with T.spiralis.</p>
                <p>The present results indicate that cytolytic function and number of NK cells are
                    augmented during migration and settlement of larvae of T.spira- lis in muscles
                    of the infected mice. The possible impact of this phenome- non upon the growth
                    of neoplastic tissue as well as the course of trichi- nellosis per se is

                <p>Eimeria falciformis, neutrophils, lysis.</p>
                <p>Two major mechanisms could be involved in the in vitro lysis of coccidian
                    sporozoites by neutrophils after they have been recognized by antibodies :
                    release of enzymes from the cytoplasmic granules, and generation of highly toxic
                    oxygen radicals. In order to further investigate this phenomenon, thirty
                    chemicals were selected from three groups lysosomotropic amines which interfered
                    with lysosomal functions and enzymatic release, modulators of cyclic AMP
                    concentrations and modulators of the respiratory burst. Each agent was added to
                    the standard assay according to already published methods but only inhibitory
                    activities were followed. Thirteen compounds significantly inhibited lysis over
                    specific concentration ranges. Some of them such as quinacrine or amiloride were
                    toxic for neutrophils at high concentrations. Active compounds were found in the
                    three groups ; lidocaine, dansylcadaverine in the first, EDTA, isoproterenol
                    dimethylsulfoxid, amiloride and aminophylline in the second and superoxyde
                    dismutase, quinacrine and sodium fluoride in the third. Inactive drugs belong
                    also to the three groups : diphenylamine, 5' AMP and rotenone or chlorpromazine
                    were inactive.</p>
                <p>The problem is further complicated by the fact that most agents may deserve
                    several functions ; a number led to ionic changes in the cells and in their
                    local environment, and EDTA for example can act also on the complement cascade.
                    In conclusion, the sporozoite lysis is a complex phenomenon which resulted both
                    from the release of enzymes and from oxygen radicals production and may use
                    several secondary messengers which are still under study.</p>

                <p>In early stages of infection a DTH response measured by footpad swelling was
                    detected similarly both in male and female mice. Later, DTH decreased in female
                    mice concomitant with an increase in parasite load, whereas the DTH was

                    indicating that the difference between donors and receivers was more qualitative

                    receivers Ig collected 4 days after transfer, but not those collected before

                    importance in influencing blowfly infections. Immuno- histological studies of
                    frozen and paraffin sections were used to characterise cell populations from
                    both control (uninfected) and infected sites. A range of monoclonal antibodies
                    (mAbs) directed against specific sheep leukocyte cell surface antigens were used
                    including: CD5, CD4, CD8, T19, d TCR, CD45, CD45R, OLA CI and OLA CII and
                    surface immunoglobulin (sIg).</p>
                <p>Preliminary results indicated a large cellular infiltration into the infected
                    area with many cells being CD45*. Subpopulations staining with cp4*, SBU-719*
                    and CD45R* mAbs were also detected in lesion sites. Eosinophils were found in
                    significantly greater numbers in infected sites and appeared localised to the
                    lower dermis, however, this response was not consistent between all sheep
                    tested.</p>
                <p>These results indicate that L. cuprina infections are not only associated with
                    gross physical changes to the skin but are met with a correspondingly large

                <p>TNF and P. falciparum growth Tumour necrosis factor (TNF), which has been
                    implicated, at some undefined step, in cell-mediated immunity to malaria, will
                    inhibit malaria growth in vivo but not in vitro. We tested whether serum from
                    mice given a dose of TNF sufficient to inhibit Plasmodium chabaudi in vivo would
                    also inhibit Plasmodium falciparum in vitro, which TNF itself will not do.
                    Groups of normal CBA mice received 10 ug r hu TNF (Asahi) i.v., and were bled
                    out 2 hr later. Their sera, at concentrations up to 2.4% V/V, failed to inhibit
                    P. falciparum (strain FCQ 27) in vitro. Since Corynebacterium parvum greatly
                    sensitizes mice to TNF toxicity, we next gave the same (10 lg) dose of TNF to
                    mice that had received an intravenous injection of 1 mg killed C. parvum
                    (Coparvax, Wellcome) 11 days earlier. In contrast to the previous group, serum
                    collected 2 hr after TNF had been injected into these mice was extremely
                    inhibitory to P. falciparum in vitro (82% inhibition at 2.4% V/V). There is
                    ample evidence that TNF inhibits P. falciparum via an indirect mechanism, and
                    these results are consistent with activated macrophages being a necessary step
                    in this process.</p>

                    Sprague-Dawley rats were stomach intubated with different numbers of third-
                    stage larvae (L3) of Angiostrongylus cantonensis. Rats infected with 100 or 200
                    larvae had more worms and higher ELISA antibody levels than rats in- fected with
                    400 larvae. More worms were recovered from young rats (8 weeks old) than from
                    adult (6 months old) and ageing rats (13 months old). Sple- nectomized rats had
                    more and longer worms and lower antibody levels when compared to intact and sham
                    spenectomized rats. Humoral immune responses were analyzed by crossed
                    immunoelectrophoresis. No precipitin peaks were observed when antisera were
                    collected from rats at the first two weeks of infection. Reacted with antisera
                    collected at the 4th and the 8th week of infection, antigens extracted from L3
                    produced 4 and 3 precipitin peaks, respectively, antigens derived from
                    fifth-stage larvae (L5) developed 8 and 4 peaks, respectively, while antigens
                    extracted from adults formed 7 and 5 peaks, respectively. Acquired immunity was
                    induced by immunizing rats with live L3 or somtaic antigens from LS or adults.
                    Rats immunized twice had significantly fewer worms than rats immunized three
                    times. Fewer worms were recovered from rats immunized with 200 live L3 than from
                    any other groups.</p>
                <p>Rats immunized with somatic antigens had higher ELISA antibody levels than rats
                    immunized with live larvae. Rats immunized with live L3 of A. canto- nensis were
                    more strongly protected against challenge infections (62%-92%) than rats
                    immunized with antigens extracted from L5 (0-30%) and adult worms (11%-248).</p>

                    To determine the immune response to major subunit vaccine candidates occuring in
                    populations under natural conditions of exposure to P. falciparum is of major
                    interest. We measured the humoral and cellular responses to syn- thetic peptides
                    reproducing the repeat sequences of 2 major P. falciparum antigens, the
                    Pf155/RESA and the CS pro- tein in individuals living in a rural community near
                    Antananarivo. 3 peptides from the RESA were studied, 2 reproducing the 3’ repeat
                    sequences and the third the 5’ sequence. (NANP)5 reproducing the major repeat of
                    the CS protein was used. Blood samples from 84 subjects were obtained at the
                    beginning and the end of the transmission season. Cellular response was assessed
                    by measurement of lymphocyte proliferation and lymphocyte subsets (by flow
                    cytometry). Presence and level of antibodies (Ab) to these antigens were
                    assessed by EMIF and FAST-ELISA.</p>
                <p>At enrolment, subjects presenting with (41) or without (43) blood parasites had
                    similar T-cell proliferation and Ab level to all antigens tested. However, P.
                    falciparum-infected individuals exhibited a decrease in the abso- lute number of
                    T lymphocytes, due to a diminution in CD8+ and natural killer lymphocytes. The
                    number of CD4+ cells was similar in both groups. In the overall population,
                    45.4% of subjects had a T-cell response to at least 1 RESA peptide (30 to 35%
                    responding to a given peptide) and 35.1% to NANP. 32.5% of the donors presented
                    with anti-RESA Ab and 22.9% had anti-NANP Ab.</p>
                <p>After 20 weeks, at the end of the transmission season, cellular proliferative
                    responses to all antigens mar- kedly decreased, as evidenced by a diminution of
                    both number of responders and mean stimulation indexes. Humoral response to RESA
                    (number of subjects with anti-RESA Ab and mean Ab titers) markedly increased.
                    Humoral res- ponse to NANP was similar. The suppression of the cellular response
                    to RESA and CS protein peptides after conti- nuous exposure to P. falciparum
                    must be taken into account for the potential use in endemic areas of subunit
                    vaccines.</p>

                <p>Antibody titres, together with various parasitological parameters, were monitored
                    in 4 groups of calves. Three groups received mixed artificial infections of
                    Ostertagia ostertagi and Cooperia oncophora, either as a low or high dose
                    trickle infection given twice weekly, or high doses given monthly for a period
                    of 4 months. One group remained as an unin- fected control. All groups were then
                    exposed to natural larval pickup from pasture. The 3 artificially infected
                    groups had lower faecal egg counts following natural larval challenge, which was
                    also reflected in serum pepsinogen. The anti-O.ostertagi antibody responses
                    differed between immunoglobulin classes. The IgM and IgA antibody levels of
                    infected calves did not differ much from those of controls, whereas all infected
                    groups showed distinct rises in IgGl antibodies from 2 to 3 months after the
                    start of the experiment. After exposure to natural infection on pasture the IgGl
                    antibody levels of the controls gradually approached those of the groups
                    artificially infected prior to turn out. In contrast, 1gG2 antibody levels rose
                    more slowly, and a dose-dependent response was observable towards the end of the
                    season. The anti-C.oncophora antibodies exhibited an earlier elevation than that
                    against O.ostertagi, which corresponds with the ability of calves to mount a
                    more significant protec- tive immune response against C.oncophora than against
                    O.ostertagi.</p>

                    Kou, (near Bobo-Dioulasso, Bur- kina Faso), was performed in June, 1987 (before
                    the transmission season), August-September 1987 (during the transmission season)
                    and January 1988 (after the seasonal transmission). The presence of circulating
                    stable antigen (S-Ag) and the serological antibody (Ab) responses against
                    exoantigens (E-Ag) of Plasmodium falciparun and synthetic peptides representing
                    repeat amino acid sequences of the P. falciparum Ring-Infected Erythrocyte
                    Surface Antigen (RESA) : (EENV)_, (FENVEHDA), , (DDEHVEFPIVA). were evaluated.
                    The clinical lengitudinal study during the seasonal manier permitted to define
                    three different groups in function of both age and occur- rence of clinical
                    malarial attack (5,000 parasites/mm3 of blood and axillary fever 37.7 C). The
                    adult group (III) had the highest rates of Ab to both E-Ag and RESA peptides.
                    Most positivity rates increased with age.</p>
                <p>Nevertheless, IgM prevalence to E-Ag was maximal in the group IL (individuals
                    with no malarial attack during the study and age less than 16 years old). The
                    group I (persons with less than 16 years old and who contracted at least one
                    malarial attack during the seasonal transmission) did not have any circulating
                    S-Ag at the first passage and showed the lowest rate of Ab to E-Ag and to RESA
                    synthetic peptides. Therefore, circulating S-Ag could participate in the
                    mechanisms involved in the development of the immune status. IgM Ab to E-Ag
                    could also play a role in the acquired protective immunity against P. falciparum
                    in synergy with the TIgG Ab to E-Ag and to RESA but they are not sufficient to
                    confer a clear-cut protection against the parasite.</p>

                    Interaction of Giardia-trophozoites with peritoneal macrophage, derived from

                    The host immune response towards pre-erythrocytic stages of P. falciparum
                    malaria is still poorly understood. In vitro experiments have suggested that
                    gamma interferon (y-IF), CD8+ T- cells, and anti-circumsporozoite (CS) protein
                    antibodies were potent inhibitors of sporozoite in- vasion or hepatic schizont
                    maturation. To assess the role played in vivo by these factors, we conducted a
                    prospective study in individuals naturally exposed to P. falciparum infection.
                    40 individuals presenting with a negative thick blood smear at the outpatients
                    clinic of Mana- rintsoa, Madagascar, were enrolled in this study and followed
                    for 8 weeks to detect the appea- rence of parasites in blood. 19 subjects
                    remained negative for malaria, while 21 individuals pre- sented with a positive
                    thick blood smear before the end of follow-up. Among those, 7 presented with
                    parasite in blood within the first 2 weeks and were excluded from subsequent
                    analysis, as they probably were already infected by sporozoites at the time of
                    enrolment. When measured at enrolment, the level of antibody to (NANP)5, the
                    lymphocyte proliferation in presence of (NANP)5, the number of lymphocytes, B
                    lymphocytes, T lymphocytes, CD8+, CD4+, NK, and ac- tivated T ceils were similar
                    among individuals that will present with a P. falciparum infection, and in those
                    who will not. However, the serum level of y-IF, as measured by ELISA using a
                    commercial kit, was significantly higher in individuals that will not present
                    with a P. falcipa- rum infection during the whole follow up, than in the other
                    (Man Withney U test, one tail, p&lt; 0.02). These data demonstrate that y-IF may
                    also inhibit the maturation of hepatic stages of P.</p>

                    infections with Leishmania infantum were studied in an attempt to develop a

                <p>Dogs were inoculated intradermally with organisms séquestered inside allogenic or

                    tissues but without disease expression. Maximal antibodies titers correlated

                <p>Classes and sub-classes of immunoglobulin (Ig) have been assayed in pooled plasma
                    sam- ples of infected and control mice, using sandwich ELISA -and hightly
                    specific anti-isotype monoclonal antibodies. Balb/C mice were infected by 100
                    T.cruzi (Tehuantepec strain) and blood was collected every 7 days during 20
                    weeks.</p>
                <p>In comparison to control mice, IgM levels were particularly increased (x 6.5) in
                    the acute phase of the disease and peaked on the 3th week post-infection (wpi),
                    when parasi- temia was maximum. Then, IgM levels regularly decreased but were
                    still higher (x 2 to x 4) than control levels during the chronic phase of the
                    infection. Total IgG levels increased (x 3) on the 4th wpi, when parasitemia was
                    decreasing,and remained stable until the 10th wpi, before to decrease regularly.
                    IgD levels were weakly modified and IgA and IgE had levels similar to the
                    controls.</p>
                <p>Among IgG isotypes, IgGl and IgG3 had similar Kinetics and levels peaked on the
                    5th- 6th wpi (x 3), i.e. on the end of the acute phase and, then, decreased
                    regularly to reach the control levels. IgG2a levels were remarkably increased (x
                    5.5) during the chronic disease, between the 10th and the 12th wpi. This
                    enhancement began on the end of the acute phase (6th wpi) and rapidly decreased
                    on the 10-12th wpi. IgG2b showed weaker increased levels (x 2.7),during the
                    acute phase of the infection, which were sta- ble until the 14th wpi.</p>
                <p>Such results highlight different kinetics of Ig isotypes (particularly for IgM
                    and IgG2a) during the murine T.cruzi infection, indicating a major role of this
                    parasite to disturb the naturally equiTibrated isotypic network of the immune
                    system. This raises the question of the mechanisms of such disturbances and of
                    its role on the immune respon- se against T.cruzi.</p>

                    Denmark Ascaris suum - pigs - trickle inoculations - parasite kinetics An
                    attempt was made to imitate the natural infection pattern in an Ascaris infected
                    herd. Parasite kinetics were studied in three groups of previously parasite free
                    pigs from the age of weaning to slaughter at a weight of 90 kg. Group I served
                    as uninoculated controls, group II designated the low trickle group, received 25
                    infective A.suum eggs twice weekly, and group III designated the high trickle
                    group, received 500 eggs twice weekly. The majority of the pigs in each group
                    were followed throughout the experimental period, but in addition animals were
                    killed at regular intervals to monitor the parasite status more detailed during
                    the course of infection.</p>
                <p>First eggs in feces were noticed in week 7, but many pigs of each trickle group
                    did not excrete eggs at any time of the experiment, and even fewer harbored
                    adult worms at the time of slaughter. With regard to egg counts and worm
                    findings there were no distinct differences between the trickle groups. In
                    contrast, all inoculated pigs showed white spots in the liver, the high trickle
                    group having peak values around weeks 6 and the low trickle around week 9.
                    Numbers of spots per liver, which were related to the egg dose levels, gradually
                    diminished toward the normal time of slaughter (90 kg). The specific serum
                    1gG/IgA (ELISA) responses to A.suum larval antigen raised earlier in the high
                    trickle group than in the low trickle group but towards the end of the
                    experiment titres of the two groups became comparable.</p>
                <p>The experiment demonstrates that pigs continuously exposed to A.suum eggs
                    inevitably elicits significant antibody increases and show white spot responses
                    in the livers, both responses being dose dependent. In contrast many of the pigs
                    never established adult worms in the small intestine irrespective of the
                    infection dose level.</p>

                    TROPHOZOITES G. M. Faubert and S. Bertrand. Institute of Parasitology of McGill
                    University, Ste-Anne de Bellevue, Québec, Canada H9X 1C0 Giardiasis,
                    macrophages, gerbils, immunity Macrophages have been identified as effector
                    cells in human and animal giardiasis. Human peripheral blood monocytes are
                    spontaneously cytotoxic for Giardia lamblia trophozoites grown in vitro (Smith
                    et al., J. Immunol. 128: 1372, 1982). Belosevic and Faubert (Immunology 59: 269,
                    1986) have shown that thioglycollate-elicited macrophages from uninfected mice
                    killed more G. muris in the presence or absence of normal or immune serum when
                    compared to killing by resident cells. Since no studies to date have been
                    reported on the cytotoxicity of activated macrophages for G. lamblia, we ask
                    ourselves the following questions: 1) will lymphokines be able to activate
                    gerbil (Meriones unguiculatus) macrophages and enhance the production of H202 or
                    ingest synthetic macro- beads? 2) if so, will activated macrophages be more
                    cytotoxic for trophozoites? 3) will BCG immunization lead to protection against
                    giardiasis? Lymphokines were obtained from gerbil spleen cells which had been
                    cultured for 72 h in RPMI medium in the presence of concanavalin A. Macrophages
                    treated with the crude lymphokines were stimulated and generated 6 times more
                    nanomoles of H202 per mg of macrophages than those treated with RPMI. Macrobeads
                    were ingested by 54.2% of lymphokine-treated macrophages, compared to by only
                    33% of macrophages treated with RPMI. Macrophages treated with lymphokines kill
                    twice as many trophozoites as do those incubated with RPMI. BCG immunization
                    with 10? colony-forming units 8 days prior to infection with Giardia failed to
                    protect the gerbils. The results suggest that the killing of the trophozoites by
                    macrophages is partly mediated by H202 and partly by phagocytosis. Secondly, the
                    failure of BCG immunization to protect the gerbils indicates that, although
                    macrophages do not play a primary role in the control of infection, these cells
                    may participate in the resolution of infection. (Supported by NSERC) 523 S5.B -

                <p>Calcium ions act as one of the key second messengers in the control of oxygen
                    free radicals (OFR) production in inflammatory cells including neutrophils or
                    macrophages. They form an important parasiticidal mechanism in L. donovani
                    infections. The parasite derived excretory secretory products bind to calcium
                    thus affecting the availability of intracellular calcium ions within the
                    inflammatory cells. So the present study was carried out to investigate ths

                <p>Peritoneal macrophages exposed to a concentration of 120 ng/ml of nifedipine
                    showed a significant increase (P 0.001) in the percentage of infected

                    (LDU/LIVER) also showed a significant increase (P 0.01) in nifedipine-fed L.
                    donovani infected BALB/C mice, when compared to non-nifedipine-fed mice, on
                    different post infection days. Peak chemiluminiscence (CL) responses were
                    significantly depressed (P 0.001) in nifedipine-fed L. donovani infected mice
                    when compared to non-nifedipine-fed mice, on all post infection days. CL
                    responses were restored to normal in nifedipine-fed L. donovani infected and
                    sodium Stibogluconate treated mice. In order to ascertain the observed effect of
                    nifedipine on Ca* entry blockage, it was observed that 500 ng/ml of nifedipine
                    caused a 23+2.1 percent drop is entry of calcium ions. From these studies it is
                    clear that the availability of intracellular calcium is an important defense

                    Antibody It is possible to protectively immunize dogs against larval Dirofilaria
                    immitis, thereby preventing infection. The nature of the immune effector
                    mechanism(s), however, is unknown.</p>
                <p>This study was intended to determine the potential larvicidal role for antibody.
                    Three separate experiments were conducted wherein antibody from immune dogs was
                    passively transferred to mice which received concommitant larval challenge. Male
                    BALB/cByJ mice were used in all experiments, and larval challenge was
                    accomplished in each mouse by placing 20 third-stage larvae within diffusion
                    chambers with subsequent subcutaneous implantation of the chamber.</p>
                <p>One-half ml of immune serum, naive serum, or infection-control serum was
                    administered adjacent to the chamber at the time of larval challenge. (Chamber
                    membranes had pore sizes of either 0.1 or 5.0 um to exclude or include cells,
                    respectively. Two experiments were terminated three weeks post-challenge and one
                    experiment was terminated two weeks post challenge. In each experiment immune
                    serum conferred a reduction in the number of fourth-stage larvae. By comparison
                    to controls, those mice challenged with chambers covered with 5.0 um pore size
                    membranes yielded 34 and 33% larval reductions in the experiments which lasted
                    three weeks whereas 17% reductions were observed two weeks after challenge.
                    There was no evidence for improved larval killing when cells were permitted to
                    enter the diffusion chambers. There was no parasite growth retardation evident
                    in the remaining larvae; larval growth retardation is observed in actively
                    immunizcd animals. These data suggest that antibody will effect some larval
                    killing, and larval death may increase over time. However, killing of the
                    remainder of the parasites is due to a non- humoral mechanism. (Supported by an

                <p>P. falciparum - opsonization - Saimiri - man-protection We have developed a
                    squirrel monkey (Saimiri sciureus) experimental model of Plasmodium falciparum
                    infection useful in studies designed to identify and characterize antigens and
                    antibodies involved in the protective immune response against the blood stages
                    of the parasite. We have previously shown that anti-malaria antibodies developed
                    by squirrel monkeys after drug controlled P. falciparum blood stage infection
                    play an important part in acquired protection. The antibodies can be separated
                    by monoclonal antibodies into two populations (3A2/G6+ and 3E4/H8+). Only
                    population (342/G6+) is capable by passive transfer to confer protection to a
                    naive monkey challenged with parasitized red blood cells (PRBC). Now we
                    established that protection conferred by type 3A2/G6+ protective Ig is solely
                    associated with an in vitro opsonic activity which is not detectable for 3E4/H8+
                    non protective Ig. Moreover, there exists a correlation between the ability of
                    3A2/G6+ Ig population to opsonize PR&amp; in vitro and the degree of protection
                    developed by the animals against an experimental P.</p>
                <p>falciparum infection. Furthermore, other results indicate that the 3E4/H8+ non
                    protective Ig population cam- pete with protective opsonic 3A2/G6+ antibodies
                    when coincubated with PRBC. Through the use of anti-human Fc R antibodies we
                    have been able to show that the principal receptor involved is Fc RIII. In the
                    human system it is possible to find similar results. Indeed, immune sera with
                    opsonic activity are preferentially found in individuals who had resided for
                    many years in endemic areas. Moreover, only IgGl and 3 exhibit an opsonic ac-
                    tivity on PRBC, whereas IgG2 and 4 which are devoid of any opsonic activity,
                    inhibit the phagocytose of PRBC mediated by 1IgGi and 3. Those results highlight
                    the importance of surface antigens as vaccine candidates and the role of the
                    balance between protective and blocking antibodies showing that protection is
                    confered by qualitative rather than quantitative characteristics of
                    antibodies.</p>

                    Toxocariosis The antibody mediated immunity measured in human and animal models
                    shows sometimes osci- llations that are of difficult evaluation.We have studied
                    the dynamic of the immune res- ponse in animal models in order to improve the
                    knowledge of its time-course but contro- lled experiments in human models have
                    not so far been designed.To established a correla- tion between both(human and
                    animal)models we have followed the antibody title evolution in a group of
                    patients with clinical diagnosis of toxocariosis during a five years period
                    Antibody levels were measured by ELISA with larval excretory-secretory antigen
                    and sera were used at a dilution of 1/150.Results were assessed by establishing
                    the Diagnostic In- dex(Guillén et al. 1986)(Aguila et al. 1988).</p>
                <p>Eleven out of the sixty patients studied were followed for periods between three
                    and five years and five of them kept positive levels.The others were followed
                    for periods between to or less than one year and it was found that only one
                    patient showed sero-conversion which occurred within a four month period.This
                    could suggest a possible infestation du- ring this period.</p>
                <p>We could concluded that: 1.- Larvae can survive for at least five years in
                    humans.</p>
                <p>2.- Antigenic stimulàtion is enough to keep high levels of immunoglobulins for a
                    long ti- me.</p>
                <p>3.- Antibody levels decrease slowly and graduallÿ.</p>
                <p>4.- This pattern is similar to that shown by animal models as observed by as and
                    other workers.</p>

                    11794-8161 Trichinella spiralis and Complement The infective larvae and adults
                    of T. spiralis are thought to activate the complement system (C) via the
                    alternative pathway as evidenced by the work of several investigators. However,
                    the methods employed in these studies relied primarily upon the detection of C
                    fragments on or, the adherence of leukocytes to the parasite surface as an
                    indication of C activation and therefore did not preclude the possibility of
                    random deposition of proteoiytic products of C (e.g. C3) or specific binding of
                    individual components. The present studiez were therefore undertaken to examine:
                    (a) if activation of C can also occur via the classical pathway, (b) at which
                    stage(s) of the parasite C activating capacity is acquired and, (c) what
                    molecular entities of the epicuticle and/or cuticle are responsible for
                    recognition and initiation of C activation. Our studies indicate that incubation
                    of parasites obtained from infected mice with either NHS or Mg.EGTA-NHS,
                    followed by incubation (1 hr, 370 C), with EAs or rabbit Es respectively, showed
                    a time- and parasite number-dependent depletion of hemolytic complement. That
                    this depletion is due to C-activation is indicated by the concomitant depletion
                    of C1, C4, or in the case of the alternative pathway of and factor B. In
                    addition, our results showed that all stages of T. spiralis ï.e. infective
                    larvae, adults, and newborn were capable of activating C with the newborn being
                    the most potent when parasite number and size were taken into nsideration.
                    Further evidence of C activation was obtained from Western blot analysis in
                    which homogenates of parasite cuticle preincubated with serum showed the
                    presence of C1q, C3b, polymerized (2- 3 molecules) of C9 and Bb, whereas
                    controls without serum were negative. These results clearly demonstrate that the
                    surface of all stages of T. spiralis possesses molecule(s)that can recognize and
                    trigger C activation.</p>

                    Mice Recent work using Hymenolepis nana and Taenia taeniaeformis/mouse systems
                    has strongly suggested that stage-specific immunity against reinfection is
                    expressed in mice harboring or having harbored metacestodes derived from
                    oncospheres of these cestodes inoculated orally. Also there exists cross
                    immunity between the tuo species in mice (Ito et al. 1988, [.J.P. 18, 691).
                    Hymenolepidid cestodes other than H. nana require beetles as the intermediate
                    host. Thus, It has been conceived that oncospheres of H. microstoma and H. dimi-
                    nuta etc. do not invade the intestinal tissue of the definitive mouse host.
                    However, mice experiencing or having experienced patent infection with H.
                    microstoma show complete resistance to the challenge with onco- spheres of H.
                    nana (Ito et al. 1988, [.J.P. Furthermore, oncospheres of il. microstoma invade
                    the mouse intestinal tissue (Ünitake et al. 1990, J:H. in press). Here we report
                    that mice given viable onco- spheres of several heterologous species become
                    resistant to H. nana challenge and re-evaluate the role of oncospheres as
                    immunogens in both the intermediate and definitive host mammals.</p>
                <p>When BALB/c mice inoculated with viable oncospheres of the heterologous species
                    (Hymenolepis diminuta, H. microstoma, Taenia taeniaeformis) and the homologous
                    one (H. nana) were challenged with oncospheres 0 nana 4 days after the primary
                    inoculations, they showed strong and complete resistance to H. nana challenge,
                    respectively: The numbers of cysticercoids of H. nana recovered in mice
                    previously given viable oncospheres of the heterologous species all were
                    significantly lower than that in control mice given PBS only (P &lt; 0.01
                    Mann-Whitney test), whereas no cysticercoids developed in mice previously given
                    viable oncospheres of H.</p>
                <p>nana The resistance was not evoked in mice given non-viable oncospheres of any
                    species with even 1000 times more than viable ones or in congenitally athymic
                    nude mice given viable ones. Microscopic observations have -revealed that
                    oncospheres of H. diminuta and H. microstoma, which require beetles as the
                    intermediate host, as well as T. taeniaeformis and F. nana, which require mice
                    as the intermediate host, can invade the intes- tinal tissue of the definitive
                    host mice. Therefore, it seems probable to conclude that the resistance to H.
                    nana challenge is evoked in mice with oncospheres which have invaded the host
                    tissue. It is strongly suggested that the complete resistance to H. nana
                    challenge in mice previously given viable oncospheres of this parasite is evoked
                    by two components of the oncosphere; stage-specific immunity evoked by
                    oncospheres of all species which can invade the host tissue and species-specific
                    immunity evoked by H. nana itself.</p>

                    cytometry We have used flow cytometry to demonstrate the high resistance of the
                    trypomastigote stage of T. cruzi (the causative agent of Chagas' disease) to
                    antibody-dependent complement-mediated lysis. Whereas the epimastigote form is
                    efficiently lysed by normal serum alone, lysis of trypomastigotes never exceeds
                    30%, even in the presence of a parasite-specific IgG or monoclonal antibodies.
                    In addition, FACS analyses of antibody binding have shown sub-populations of
                    trypomastigotes which differ in the amount of immunoglobulin bound. When these
                    sub-populations were sorted and exposed to complement, lysis of the parasites
                    which bound a higher amount of IgG did not exceed 30%. We are currently
                    examining the deposition of C3 to trypomastigotes and epimastigotes of the
                    Brazil strain of T. cruzi. Results indicate that epimastigotes bind
                    significantly more 1125-C3 than trypomastigotes. This is in agreement with other
                    studies of different strains of T. cruzi. However, whereas other investigators
                    have observed an increase in C3 binding in the presence of a parasite-specific
                    antibody to trypomastigotes of other strains, our results do not appear to show
                    this increase. Future studies will examine patterns of antibody binding and C3
                    deposition in clonal populations of the Brazil strain of T. cruzi. Supported by

                    study was performed in The Gambia to test the prevalence of precipitating
                    antibodies to different soluble antigens of Plasmodium falciparum including the
                    endotoxin-like Ag7 which stimulates production of tumour necrosis factor (TNF)
                    and interleukin-1 in vitro.</p>

                    precipitating antibodies against soluble antigens affinity purified from
                    supernatants of a P.falciparum in vitro culture.</p>
                <p>By the age of 5 years, when morbidity due to malaria decrease, 74% of the
                    children had gained antibodies to the endotoxin-like Ag7, and this seropositive
                    rate was maintained through adulthood.</p>
                <p>In contrast maximum prevalence of precipitating antibodies to four other tested
                    soluble antigens was seen after 25-35 years of age.</p>
                <p>The prevalence of antibody against Ag7 thus correlates with the development of
                    clinical immunity. Ag7 may contribute to the pathogenesis of malaria, perhaps
                    through its ability to induce the production of TNF. This suggests that Ag7
                    might be a candidate for an "anti-disease'' vaccine.</p>

                <p>Killing of metacestodes by macrophages and the regulation of this activity by
                    cytokines were studied in vitro. Macrophage-mediated killing of E. granulosus
                    protoscoleces (PSC) was inhibited by T-cell cytokine released on culture of
                    lymphocytes with PSC.</p>
                <p>Conversely, similar co-cultures with M. corti tetrathyridia (MCT) produced
                    lymphokine which increased killing of MCT by macrophages. Larvicidal activity
                    (against both MCT and PSC) was enhanced by high concentrations of macrophage
                    activity factors produced by Con A-stimulated rat lymphocytes (Con A-LK) but was
                    reduced by low concentrations of these factors. The Con A-LK effect was
                    synergised by murine recombinant interferon (r.IFN- Y). The regulatory effect of
                    r.IFN-# was confirmed in vivo since intra- peritoneal injection of 1,000U
                    r.IFN-Y caused a 50% reduction in susceptibility to infection. Macrophages,
                    8-20wk post-infection with MCT were refractory to activation by Con A-LK,
                    r.IFN-# or cytokine from MCT-stimulated lymphocytes. Thus, two different
                    mechanisms may regulate potentially larvicidal mechanisms. E. granulosus can
                    elicit the production of lymphokines suppressive for PSC killing whereas M.
                    corti appears directly to induce a refractory state in effector macrophages.</p>

                <p>The ABC-ELISA was more sensitive than the ordinary ELISA, hence allowed the
                    resulting color spots on the dried plate wells to be read clearly with the naked
                    eye. An excellent correlation between the. ABC-ELISA and the IFAT titers was
                    obtained (correlation coefficient:0.97). This test can be carried out without
                    using major electrical equipment. “he visualization on the computer screen of
                    the malaria prevalence map was achieved by a Lap-Top computer (J-3100,TOSHIBA)
                    in which a statistical package was also programmed. The ABC-ELISA and the
                    computer system were useful for the risk assessment of malaria epidemics that
                    occurred after the flood in the Sudan Gezira.</p>

                    tests.</p>
                <p>Chicks immunised with the Houghton (H) strain suffered a significant weight
                    depression after heterologous challenge with Mymensingh (M) strain when the

                    by the criterion of oocyst output ; but chicks immunised with M strain showed a
                    high degree of protection against heterologous challenge. When chicks were
                    solidly immune to homologous challenge by both criteria, heterologous immunity
                    was aëmost complete. Because it ïis difficult to develop solid immunity in young

                    Previous analysis of immune responses in human schistosomiasis has shown that
                    IgG antibodies are able to kill schistosomula in the presence of eosinophils.
                    This study was designed to test the role of each IgG subclass in the
                    eosinophil-dependent killing reaction.</p>
                <p>IgG antibodies purified by protein G or protein A affinity chromatography
                    demonstrated a killing effect only in the presence of eosinophils activated in
                    vivo or normal eosinophils activated in vitro by eosinophil activating factor.
                    Purification of each IgG isotype allowed confirmation of these results and
                    demonstrated that the killing effect was associated with IgG1 and 1gG3
                    antibodies. IgG2 antibodies expressed a dual function : 1) an effector function
                    with activated eosinophils and 2) a blocking function with normal eosinophils,
                    IgG4 antibodies, whatever the source of eosinophils, blocked the killing
                    mediated by 1gG effector antibodies. These findings together with previous
                    results suggest that at least two factors may contribute to the slow development
                    of immunity observed in S, mansoni-infected children.</p>

                    haematobium, eggs, leukocytes It is well known that within a cohort of children
                    infected with schistosomes à relationship exists between the age of the children
                    and their immune status. In the current study an attempt was made to determine
                    whether or not a correlation exists between the age of children infected with
                    Schistosoma haematobium and the intensity with which leukocytes adhere to the
                    schistosome eggs passed in their urine. À method enabling the measurement of the
                    intensity of adherence was first developed by means of scanning electron
                    microscopy, after which it was adapted for light microscopy. The results
                    obtained indicate that the intensity of adherence decreases with age. The result
                    is unexpected but important as it has bearing on contemporary views on immunity
                    to human schistosomiasis, in particular, the blocking antibody theory.</p>

                    neutrophils - phagocytosis The importance of both humoral and cell-mediated
                    immune responses in immunity to malaria has been emphasised. The mechanisms by
                    which T cells, as components of the cell-mediated immune response, contribute to
                    immunity against malaria is undefined.</p>
                <p>Observations on patients blood smears and in vitro studies indicate neutrophils
                    interact and phagocytose P. falciparum. In this study we have investigated the
                    effects of cytokines released by activated T lymphocytes and macrophages on
                    neutrophils mediated killing of P. falciparum.</p>
                <p>Neutrophils isolated from human peripheral blood were treated with either
                    lymphotoxin (TNFB), interferon gamma (IFNy) and cachectin (TNFa) and then
                    examined for anti-P. falciparum activity using a radiometric assay. In the
                    absence of cytokine treatment, neutrophils caused significant damage of P.
                    falciparum in the presence of complement or antibody as opsonin. All the three
                    cytokines augmented the neutrophil mediated killing at different degrees.
                    &amp;ecombinant TNFœ (r-TNFa) was effective at 20- 25-U, rIFN-y and rINFB at
                    50-1000U/10 neutrophils. Of the three cytokines, the highest killing was always
                    seen with r-TNFa in the presence of immune serum. A strong synergism was seen
                    when r-IFNy and r-TNFa combination was used. None of the cytokines had any
                    direct anti-Plasmodium effects even at 100 fold the concentrations which were
                    effective in stimulating neutrophils, in combinations in the presence and
                    absence of antibody and complement. Electron microscopic and light microscopic
                    examinations showed that various stages of the parasite (schizonts, rings,
                    merozoites) were killed by a phagocytic mechanism. These findings suggest that T
                    cell cytokines and monokines play an important role in immunity to malaria by
                    augmenting phagocytic leukocytes.</p>

                <p>The widespread diversity observed in parasite induced antigens found on the
                    surface of P. falciparum schizont-infected erythrocytes is thought to contribute
                    to the requirement for multiple exposure to this parasite before an effective
                    immune response is observed. Studies on isolates from the Haut-Ogooue region of
                    Gabon have aiso shown high levels of diversity, although some children did have
                    an antibody response against more than one of the isolates tested. Isolates
                    collected from one child at different times were antigenically different.</p>
                <p>In the present longitudonal study up to 3 isolates have been collected from
                    individual children. Serum samples will be collected from the same children at 3

                    in suspension. Results will indicate whether such antibody levels are boosted by

                <p>When inoculated with infective larvae of B. pahangi cats develop long-term
                    microfilaraemia but if infection is continuallyÿy repeated many cats
                    spontaneously become amicrofilaraemic often presenting signs of filarial
                    pathology similar to those seen in human lymphatic filariasis. We have
                    transferred plasma and sera from amicrofilaraemic cats to microfilaraemic cats.
                    Typically microfilariae completely disappeared 72 hours after the transfer and
                    the cats remained amicrofilaraemic thereafter. No circulating adult antigen
                    could be detected from 29 days after transfer of plasma showing that adult worms
                    in the lymphatics had been killed. The lesions of the lymphatic system observed
                    prior to transfer did not become exacerbated but returned to the pre-infection
                    size. Sera frem the recipient cats was collected at several points for
                    immunological studies. On western blots a few Ag were recognised by the
                    recipients only after transfer. The recipient cats have been challenged with
                    more infective B. pahangi larvae. These experiments show that the development of
                    the effective immune response to filarial worms in cats that became
                    amicrofilaraemic, is transferable to other individuals by a soluble factor. This
                    suggests that a detailed study of the serological responses of immune cats could
                    identify antibodies responsible for host resistance and thus aid in the
                    development of a defined antigen vaccine.</p>

                    individuals younger than 20 years, 14 between 20-39 years, 19 between 40-59
                    years and 18 older than 60. Sero logy was carried out on three occasions
                    (summer, fall, winter). For IgM ELISA; sera were previously eluted trough DEAE
                    Sephadex A-50 columns to descard IgG interference. Sera we re adsorbed with
                    antigens of various heminth species before ELISA. Rheumatoid factor was
                    determined for IgM positive sera. Results are expressed as optical density
                    values (OD).</p>
                <p>Thoracic X rays of each individual were obtained at the beginning and end of the
                    follow up.</p>
                <p>The peak for IgM was observed in summer (%=0,510), declining to 0,397 at the 3rd
                    ex- traction. IgG showed low initial values (0,427), but rose from the 2nd
                    (0,527) to the 3rd extraction (0,636). In the youngest age group, the maximal
                    IgM values were obtained at the 1st extraction (0,600), declining thereafter to
                    0,451. In the oldest age group, OD for IgM were very low, but for IgG they rose
                    during the follow up. In the intermediate age groups, IgM declined and IgG rose
                    with time. IgM levels were significantly higher in people 20-40 years old than
                    in those aged 40-60. Solitary pulmonary nodule was observed only once, in a 42
                    year-old woman with a positive serology for IgG.</p>
                <p>The predominance of IgM in younger people and of IgG in the older ones points to
                    the existence of a repetitive contact with the parasite with increasing age. It
                    seems that the development of immunity is able to prevent the development of

                    L.b.pe. for A-CL and and L.b.b. for S-CL and S-MCL groups.</p>
                <p>IgG, IgA and IgM anti-Leishmania antibodies were present in the sera of S-MCL
                    patients, while the antibody response in either A-CL and S-CL patients was
                    restricted to IgG. The 1gG response on the S-MCL was greater than on either of
                    the cutaneous groups. In all the groups, the specific. IgG binding was mostly
                    due to the IgGi subclass. However, we could detect sligth but significant levels
                    of specific IgG63 in 34.8% of the S-MCL group. We didn’t found specific binding
                    of IgG62, IgG4 or Ig£E in any of the sera tested. These results show that there
                    are no significant differences in the humoral immune response, between the
                    cutaneous diseases (S-CL and A-CL). However, there are marked differences
                    between them and the mucocutaneous (S-MCL) phase of the disease. These
                    differences are both in the antibody types and in the level of response.</p>

                    with plasmodia during the pre- erythrocytic stages through complex interactions
                    involving various cell types, including the hepatocyte. À direct effect by
                    Interferon-gamma and Interleukin-1 has been clearly established but this remains
                    to be determined for TNF. We studied the in/vivo and is vitro role of TNF on the
                    hepatic stage development of P. | yoelii.</p>
                <p>In vivo: iv administration of 3x1 Alg recombinant murine TNF into BALB/c mice
                    showed 80 % protection against a challenge of 3,500 spercezedhns Of P.

                <p>in vitro: no effect on the hepatocyte level could be observed regardless of TNF

                    used.</p>
                <p>Since TNF clearly protects in vivo but has no effect in vitro, we questioned the
                    relevance of our in vitro hepatocyte model.We therefore established a co-culture
                    model, hepatocytes plus non-parenchymal cells (ratio 1:1), which mimicks better
                    the in vivo situation: 1)the hepatic schizont development of P. yoelii was
                    inhibited with 3x1 /mil TNF (35 to 50%), 2) this inhibition was related to high
                    secretion of IL-# by non-parenchymal cells.These investigations show that TNF is
                    able to inhibit in vivo and in vitro the pre-erythrocytic stage of malaria, and
                    that this inhibition is mediated at least in part by IL-6.</p>

                <p>Humoral immune response was investigated following natural and experimental
                    Cryptosporidium parvum infection in lambs fed with and without maternal
                    colostrum. Assessment of infection was made by means of daily analisis of faeces
                    using Heine and modified ZielhNeelsen techniques .</p>
                <p>Diarrhoea, milk intake and weight increase were also controlled. At 4-8 days
                    intervals after birth, blood was taken and assessed for serum IgG antibodies
                    against solubilized whole oo- cysts antigen of C.parvum using a enzyme
                    immunoassay method.</p>
                <p>Lambs fed maternal colostrum had high anti-C.parvum IgG antibody titers in their
                    sera before infection was patent (first oocysts excretion was four-five days
                    after birth) whereas colostrum deprivated lambs had not significant serum
                    specific antibody titers before oocysts excretion. Anti-C.parvum antibodÿ levels
                    peaked one to two weeks after maximum oocysts output when few oocysts were
                    present in faeces. Antibodies remained elevated throughout the expe- rimental
                    period (120 days). Lambs fed maternal colostrum had significantly less diarrhoea
                    and oocysts excretion, more milk intake and weight increase than did colostrum
                    deprivated animals.</p>
                <p>These findings indicate that passive lacteal immunity conferred a partial
                    protection against clinical cryptosporidiosis as had been suggested some
                    researchs in humans, calves and mice.</p>
                <p>Whether such protection was provided by the immunoglobulims or by other
                    biological factors present in maternal colostrum remains unclear. The
                    relationship between the development of humoral immune response against C.parvum
                    infection and the pattern of oocysts excretion in colostrum deprivated lambs
                    toghether with the mainteinance of high antibody levels a long period after
                    clearence of disease indicate the importance of immme response to control
                    infection.</p>

                    sero—epidemiological study is conducted in a malaria endemic area in Çukurova
                    Region of Turkey, to determine the characterization of anti—-sporozoite immunity
                    as measured by the levels of Plasmodium vivax (PV) circumsporozoite ( CS )
                    antibody. Entomological surveys were done in target study sites to determine the
                    transmission characteristics of the local vector, Anopheles sachorovi. It is our
                    goal to assest the relationship between the level of PVCS antibody in an endemic
                    population and mosquito transmission.</p>
                <p>CSPV antibody is determined using antibody captured ELISA with the NSI 81 V 20
                    fusion protein as the capture antigen. Standardization of the CSPV antibody
                    ELISA and first phase of this study is completed. Blood samp- les were collected
                    and processed each time approximately from 750 individuals living in study
                    sites, in June in August and in October 1989, respectively. The first year
                    results on prevalence of CSPV antibody responders were obtained.</p>
                <p>The CSPV antibody positivity rates were 5 % in June, 23.3 % in August, 17 % in
                    October among the 312 villagers samp- led three times. Similar results were
                    obtained through larger populations examined only once or twice ( 5.9 % in June,
                    24.4 % in August, 11 % in October ). However, there were no peripheral blood PV
                    slide positivity at the same time sera were obtained. Therefore, it would appear
                    that the levels of CSPV antibody did not correlate with the frequency of actual
                    infection. These results will be evaluated when we get the results of sporozoite
                    ELISA with mosquitos col- lected at the same time with blood samples and when we
                    get baseline information at the end of March 1990.</p>

                    rodent malaria parasite Plasmodium vinckei is 100% lethal.</p>
                <p>However, after two infections followed by drug cure, BALB/c mice developed solid
                    immunity which was independent of antibodies and CD8+ cells but mediated by CD4+
                    cells as shown both by in vivo depletion and adoptive transfer experiments. To
                    elucidate the cellular mechanisms involved in this immunity B-cell depleted
                    spleen cells from immune mice were challenged in vitro with lysate of P.vinckei
                    infected erythrocytes and investigated for different responses. Lysate of
                    uninfected RBC was used as control. The parasite antigen but not the control
                    antigen induced a high proliferation in T-cells from immune mice after 4 days of
                    ïin vitro incubation (SI 20-150, 3H-thymidine incorporation). As T-cells from
                    non-immune mice did not proliferate after antigen challenge, these results
                    indicate a strict parasite specificity of the response. Antigen challenge also
                    induced a highly significant and malaria specific release of IL-4 as
                    established” in a bio-assay with an 11-4 dependent cell line (J.Hu-Li et.al.,
                    J.Immunol.</p>
                <p>142, 800, 1989). The release of IFNy from these T-cells was assayed at the single
                    cell level using a modified ELISPOT assay (C.Czerkinsky et.al.,
                    J.Immunol.Methods, 110, 29, 1988). After 4 days of incubation with antigen 0.8-3
                    cells/1000 B-cell depleted spleen cells from immune mice were found to release
                    IFNy. The number of IFNy producing cells was 40-150 times higher than that found
                    in non-immune spleen cells treated in the same way. Using these in vitro
                    techniques in combination with cell transfer experiments, we are now attempting
                    to relate the appearance of CD4+ cells displaying different activities with the
                    development of protective immunity in these mice.</p>

                    response Parasite products have been previously detected in different biological
                    fluids (serum, urine, breast milk) of some O. volvulus infected individuals but
                    the effects of them on the infected individual or its offspring's im-
                    muneresponses to the parasite are largely unknown. The purpose of this stu- dy
                    was to compare the antibody responses to onchocercal antigens in child- dren
                    from Yanomami women infected with ©. volvulus and presenting different levels of
                    onchocercal antigens in milk, microfilarial loads in skin and skin pathology.
                    The methods used were a non-competitive two-site ELISA to analyze antigen levels
                    in breast milk; a direct ELISA to estimate antibody levels in sera, and western
                    blotting to analyze qualitative antigen recog- nition. À total of 92 individuals
                    aged between 6 months and 60 years (%X- 32 years) were studied. The mean
                    microfilarial desity in skin varied from 0 to 160 microfilariae/mg skin. Skin
                    lesions varied from absence of appa- rent lesions to severe skin atrophy,
                    particularly in aged individuals. An- tigen indices in breast milk of infected
                    women varied from 0 to 5. The an- tibody response to onchocercal antigens
                    increased with age from 0.10 OD to 1.25 OD (K=0.88+0.20 OD), but very high
                    antibody levels (K=0.70 OD) were also observed in a significant group of
                    children under 10 vears age. The highest levels of antibodies belonged to the
                    IgG, subclass, and the lowest to the 19G; subclass. Analysis of these results by
                    family groups indicated that the highest variability of antibody levels was in
                    the group under 10 years age, with low correlation among antibody levels in
                    parents, antigen indices in mother's milk and antibody levels in children.</p>

                <p>We examined the incidence of amicrofilaremic L.loa infections in life- long
                    residents of the endemic zone. Gabonese adults with a medically verified ocular
                    passage of an adult L.loa, who had not received diethylcarbamazine, were
                    examined for circulating L.loa microfilariae (mf). Only 18 out of 58 had
                    detectable microfilaremia (ie &gt; 1 mf/2ml blood). Thus in the endemic area
                    amicrofilaremic loaiasis (AML) is twice as common as microfilaremic loaiasis.
                    Antibody-mediated mechanisms controlling microfilaremia in these AML subjects
                    were studied. Many, but not all (21/37), AML sera were strongly positive in
                    surface immunofluorescence on living mf (IFA) and most of these (18/21) were
                    active in a 16-hour cell-mediated cytotoxicity/adherence assay (ADCC). In
                    contrast, control European sera (n=-6) and sera from 15 heavily microfilaremic
                    individuals (mf&gt;4,000/ml) were inactive, or only weakly positive, in both
                    these tests. In 12 AML sera studied the positive IFA reaction was mainly due to
                    1gG. The ADCC reaction is complement-independent and polymorphonuclear cells are
                    not necessary.</p>
                <p>Although purified T lymphocytes can adhere to mf in the presence of AML sera,
                    monocytes/macrophages are necessary for cytotoxicity. In conclusion,
                    antibody-mediated cytotoxicity directed against mf surface antigens appears to
                    be a prominent mechanism controlling microfilaremia in many naturally infected
                    subjects.</p>

                    been investigated whether on sheep, cattle or rats.However no comparative study
                    of the response at specific times post- infection (PI) to antigens Ags and
                    different mitogens has been carried out in PBL, spleen (SL) and thymus (TL)
                    1ymphocytes on the same host. The purpose of this study was to compare the
                    response of PBL, SL and TL to the stimulation to 2 mitogens (con À and PWM) and
                    to 2 Ags (crude extract of metacercaria (M) and secretion of adults (SA) of
                    fluke-infested rats to response from control rats. Antibody response to SA can
                    be detected by Elisa as soon as the first week PI. The humoral response
                    increased to reach à plateau at week 5 and remained at this high level to week 9
                    PI. The TL response to SA-Ag occured in weeks 1, 5 and 9 (PI) whereas the
                    response to M-Ag peaked in weeks 2, 5 and 7. In week 2 (PI) a marked increase of
                    the TL proliferation to con À and PWM is also enregistered then is progressively
                    suppressed between weeks 4 to 8 and increased again at week 9 (PI) the SL
                    response to both antigens and both mitogens increased markly (x5 to x50) at week
                    2 (PI). No other stimulation was obtained with M- Ag. SA-Ag and the mitogens
                    induced à second stimulation on week 4. Then both mitogens stimulated SL between
                    weeks 7 and 9 PI. PBL responsed to SA-Ag on weeks 2 and 7 (PI) whereas they
                    started to react to both mitogens only on week 9 (PI). No alteration of the
                    proliferative response to mitogens is observed within the course of this fluke-
                    infestation in rats as it was done in sheep. At the 2nd week (PI) TL and SL are
                    marked1y stimulated by both mitogens and Ags whereas PBL responsed only to
                    Ag.</p>

                    mechanisms capable of killing invading larvae of the human parasite Brugia
                    malayi are unknown. We are attempting to identify mechanisms that enable mice to
                    resist Brugia infection in order to gain insight as to the type of immune
                    response to which these parasites are susceptible. We have examined the course
                    of i.p.</p>
                <p>infections in several mouse strains which possess genetically defined immune
                    defects including SJL, W/WŸ and Beige mice. SJL mice were compared with the
                    resistant (normal) BALB/c mouse strain. Worm numbers recovered from BALB/c mice
                    decreased steadily from day 7 to day 21 of infection. In contrast, the number of
                    worms recovered from SJL mice did not alter significantly until day 21 after
                    which they declined.</p>
                <p>Similar results were obtained with the W/WV strain which appeared more
                    susceptible to infection than their histocompatible normal controls (+/+ mice).
                    However, experiments using Beige (bg/bg) mice revealed no significant difference
                    in the number of worms recovered from mice homozygous for the mutation compared
                    with heterozygous (bg/+) normal controls. v Thus SJL and W/W° mice appear to be
                    more susceptible to infection than normal mice. This suggests a role for IgE and
                    mast cells (defective in SJL and W/WV mice respectively) during the early stages
                    of murine resistance to Brugia, but natural killer cells (defective in beige
                    mice) do not appear to play an important role.</p>

                    3JN, UK P. falciparum - gametes - antigen - antibody P. vivax malaria is endemic
                    in many parts of Sri Lanka; its transmission is associated with induction of
                    anti-gamete antibodies which modulate the infectivity of the parasites to
                    mosquitoes. Since 1987 there has been a resurgence of P. falciparum malaria in
                    the island. Because the majority of individuals have not previously experienced
                    infections with this parasite this outbreak has provided the opportunity to
                    study the induction of anti-gamete and transmission modulating immunity in
                    primary infections of P. falciparum.</p>
                <p>We have collected sera from such individuals following infection and analysed
                    them for the presence of gamete specific antibodies and for their effects in
                    modulating infectivity of P. falciparum to mosquitoes. Results indicate that
                    while most individuals with P. falciparum infections have antibodies against
                    sexual stage specific antigens relatively few recognize epitopes on two known
                    targets of transmission blocking antibodies, namely the 230 and 48/45 KkDa

                <p>Immune response, Coccidiosis, Eimeria tenella Coccidiosis 1s an economically
                    important disease of poultry which 1s caused by protozoa of genus Eimeria.
                    Immunity to reinfection of chickens by coccidia may be dependent upon cell
                    mediated immunity however there 1s little information on the nature of cell
                    responses. We examined cell responses in chickens which had been infected with
                    the ceacal parasite E.tenella.</p>
                <p>Spleen cells obtained from immunised chickens secrete interferon (IFN) after
                    stimulation with coccidial antigens. This antigen specific response was also
                    detected in spleen cells in hyperimmune birds. There was a weak IFN response in
                    mucosal cells of ceaca early after infection but no response in cells from the
                    ceacal mucosa of hyperimmune chickens, suggesting the importance of non T-cell
                    mediated mechanisms in immunity.</p>
                <p>The generation of oxygen free radicals by activated leukocytes may be responsible
                    for parasite killing and may result in tissue damage, probably through lipid
                    peroxidation.</p>
                <p>Spleen and ceacal cells of uninfected birds had low levels of malonyldialdehyde
                    (MDA, a product of lipid peroxidation). These cells obtained from hyperimmune
                    chickens show 2-3 fold increase in MDA levels suggesting the involvement of
                    oxidative processes in the expression of immunity to coccidiosis in
                    chickens.</p>

                    hepatic stages of P. Yoeli. We found that peptide immunization led
                    preferentially to active CD8+ T cells in BALB/c mice, CD4+ T cells in C3H/HeJ
                    and both in C57BL /6 mice. Depending on the strain used, parasites were
                    eliminated from hepatocytes either by direct Stotoxicity or by lp hokines (e.g.#
                    IFN). The fact that the same peptide could activate different lymp Rocyte op

                <p>In areas of the world where hydatid disease, caused by Echinococcus granulosus,
                    is endemic, environmental contamination with eggs is significant and the
                    potential for infection is relatively high. Within these areas, however, the
                    actual numbers of people infected may be considered to be relatively low. In an
                    attempt to determine whether some individuals show a degree of resistance to
                    infection, an in vitro killing assay for taeniid oncospheres was devised. A
                    variety of human sera were tested for their ability to mediate oncosphere
                    killing in the presence of leucocyte fractions, prepared on a metrizamide
                    gradient, Results showed that sera from both infected and uninfected individuals
                    from endemic areas (northern Kenya and north-west China) enhanced larval killing
                    and granulocyte attachment when compared with non-endemic sera.</p>

                    dose: HD) metacercariae of Paramphistomum ichikawai; lambs from each group were
                    slaughtered with pair fed controls at 21, 42 and 84 days after infection (DAÏ).
                    Samples for histology were removed from the small intestine at 1 metre
                    intervals, fixed in Bouins solution and thin sections stained with
                    geisma-chromotrope stain. Sections were examined for mast cells, globule
                    leukocytes, eosinophils, neutrophils and plasma cells (40 x 1000 mag. fields).
                    At 21 DATI, eosinophils were more abundant in the LD (all sites) and HD (some
                    sites)’ lambs. At 42 DAÏ large numbers were present in both infection levels
                    from most sites, despite the absence of flukes at those sites. At 84 DAÏI no
                    differences were observed. The numbers of mast cells were depleted in areas
                    where flukes were present or had just migrated except at 84 DAI when the
                    distribution was irregular. Occasionally increased numbers were seen away from
                    areas where flukes were or had been. Globule leukocytes were increased at 42 DAI
                    (LD and HD) and at 84 DAI (HD). Neutrophils and macrophages were abundant when
                    tissue destruction was evident (21 and 42 DAI - HD).</p>
                <p>Plasma cells were more abundant at 42 (HD) and 84 (LD) DAÏI. Goblet cells were
                    not more abundant but were actively secreting mucin in infected lambs. The
                    transient eosinophilia coincided with the large reduction in burdens due to
                    expulsion of flukes (92% by 42 DAÏ) and therefore may aid expulsion and
                    non-specific inflammation. The role of mast and plasma cells in expulsion is
                    uncertain in this study. The appearance of globule leukocytes supports their
                    role in stimulating a delayed inflammatory response.</p>

                    experimental infection of the squirrel monkey (Saimiri sciureus) with the human
                    parasite (Plasmodium falciparum) elicits in this animal a disease fairly
                    comparable to the human disease. However, only few data are available on the
                    basic immunological status of the animals during the infection. We have compared
                    the main haematological and immunological modifications induced in intact and
                    splenectomized Saimiri monkeys, during an experimental infection with the P.</p>
                <p>falciparum FUP-1 strain. As expected, the parasitaemia in splenectomized monkeys
                    reached very high levels in a few days, whereas intact animals developed a more
                    limited infection. In both groups we observed that most haematologic parameters
                    were drastically affected when the parasitaemia was increasing. The
                    modifications were dependent upon the group to which they belonged. The
                    reactivity to mitogens such as PHA or PWM (with specificities for T or B
                    lymphocytes, controlled by FACS analysis), was also dramatically affected during
                    the course of infection, and was inversely correlated with the evolution of the
                    parasitaemia. In both groups, individual monkeys maintaining sustained
                    proliferative responses to mitogens showed to some extent the capacity to delay
                    the initial onset of parasitaemia. In this model, ahd during the very first days
                    of infection by blood passage with the FUP-I strain of P. falciparum, the
                    ability to respond to T-cell mitogens appears thus to be a good indicator of
                    potentiai defence capacities against the parasite.</p>

                    instar larvae of the myiasis blowfly Lucilia cuprina. Total IgG levels were
                    determined on silver stained SDS polyacrylamide gels by densitometry of the Ÿ
                    heavy chain band. Antibody specificity was analysed on 2-dimension immunoblots
                    of whole homogenized first instar larvae. IgG levels in the exudate increased
                    markedly around 12 h after implantation though the size of the increase varied
                    markedly between individuals, IgG was usually the major protein component of the
                    wound exudate over the whole 72 h infection period. Albumin was the other major
                    protein though usually it appeared later than IgG. Antigen specificity of the
                    antibodies in the exudate showed significant variability between individuals and
                    when compared with serum antibodies from the same individual. In most animals,
                    exudate antibodies recognized less antigens than serum antibodies. The results
                    suggest that the wound exudate is not a simple vascular leakage but a controlled
                    response by the skin associated lymphoid tissue (SALT) to larval infections.
                    This response persists even after extensive skin damage when vascular leakage is
                    also evident. The antibody specificities support this suggestion by showing
                    restricted antigen recognition by exudate antibodies. This also implies that the
                    exudate response is mainly derived from the SALT local to the infection site.
                    These findings may have significant consequences for the development of vaccines

                    cuprina.</p>
                <p>Ten sheep received two intradermal injections of a larval excretory-secretory
                    antigen preparation and were then challenged with 500 first instar maggots two
                    weeks after the second injection. Sera was collected from the sheep prior to
                    immunization, fortnightly during the immunization period and post-challenge.
                    Control sera was obtained from a second group of ten sheep, similarly challenged
                    but previously injected only with saline. Antibody specificity was examined on

                <p>Immunized sheep had significantly lower larval recoveries and lower larval

                    killed in the presence of neutrophils (1,000,000/m1) and 10% NHS. Mecha- nisms
                    responsible for this serum-mediated neutrophil Killing to T. vaginalis were
                    further demonstrated through lucigenin-amplified neutrophil chemiluminescence.
                    As demonstrated by indirect immunof luorescence, NHS showed specific
                    immunoglobulin G (IgG) titer of 1:8 for T. vaginalis. Purified IqgG, at 1.6

                <p>The kinetic of the appearance of hypergammaglobulinemia following infection of
                    C3H/HeJ mice with Trypanosoma cruzi was investigated by using ELISA. First, we
                    demonstrate that hypergammaglobulinemia, which slightly appears 14 days post-
                    infection, increases on day 28 post infection and persists during the chronic
                    phase i.e.</p>
                <p>more than 60 days post infection. This hyperglobulinemia results to a predominant
                    secretion of IgG2a isotype and most of the immunoglobulins react against self
                    antigens as myelin, keratin and myosin. These results are consistent with
                    previous data showing a lack of parasite specificity of B cell hybridoma
                    obtained from acutely T.cruzi infected animals. However, specific response
                    against T.cruzi takes an important place since it persists while parasitemia is
                    severly decreased. Indeed, parasite specific response appears two weeks post
                    infection, is maximal after 4 weeks and plateaus during the life long chronic
                    phase. In contrast with the non specific responses, the anti-T.cruzi specific
                    response results in an increase of the different isotype; Ig"4, IgG1, 1gG3,
                    IgG2b and IgG2a, all along the infection.</p>

                    immunity against cryptosporidiosis, hyperimmune bovine colostrum was produced by
                    immunizing pregnant dams with oocyst and sporozoite antigens in Ribi adjuvant
                    and collecting the first three milkings following parturition; a skimmed
                    preparation of this product made and its efficacy was evaluated and compared
                    against whole hyperimmune and control colostrum using a neonatal BALB/c mouse
                    model of infection. Significantly fewer (p&lt;.05) developing stages of C.
                    parvum were found in mice treated with hyperimmune skim colostrum (SOC) or
                    original hyperimmune colostrum (HC) than in mice receiving control skim
                    colostrum (CSC) or original control colostrum (CC) in therapeutic or
                    prophylactic experimental groups.</p>
                <p>No significant difference existed between HSC and HC treatment or prophylactic
                    regimens at the 95% confidence level. The fact that HSC showed similar
                    protective effects to HC indicates that immune cells are probably not required
                    to confer passive protection. This is under investigation.</p>

                <p>We previously reported that T. cruzi trypomastigotes infect and multiply inside T
                    lymphocytes. This was confirmed in vivo and the infection rate observed was
                    similar to that obtained in the case Of macrophage infection. Flow
                    cytofluorometry analysis of T lymphocytes purified from mice in the acute phase
                    of the disease, revealed the presence of parasitic antigens on the surface of
                    both infected and non- infected T cells. These parasite antigens appear to be
                    specific of T. cruzi .. Antibodies recognizing these surface antigens were
                    present in both infected mouse sera (IMS) and immune human sera (IHS). They were
                    able to induce cell mediated cytotoxicity in the presence of non-immune
                    mononuclear cells in autologous and also in heterologous combinations. Thus
                    synergism between cytotoxic effect raised against infected and uninfected cells
                    and the lymphocyte infection might therefore play a crucial role in the

                    30,000 L3's and sacrificed on day 42. A panel of monoclonal antibodies defining

                <p>The aim of this study was to investigate the correlation between gut
                    hypersensitivity and resistance to infection by the non-invasive instestinal
                    parasite, Trichostrongylus colubriformis. A simple quantitative approach to
                    measuring gut hypersensitivity responses to parasite antigens has been
                    developed. Guineas pigs exposed to primary infection are highly resistant to
                    challenge infection and are sensitized to excretory-secretory products and
                    homogenates of third-stage larvae (L3), fourth stage larvae (L4) and adult
                    worms. The nature of these responses and their modification by pharmacological
                    agents were typical of immediate-type hypersensitivity reactions. Gut
                    sensitivity was greatest in the anterior half of the small intestine, persisted
                    for 12 months and was more pronounced against L3 antigens than against L4 or
                    adult preparations. Guinea pigs injected with homogenates of L3, L4 or adult
                    worms were moderately sensitized to the homogenates but not to
                    excretory-secretory products.</p>
                <p>Primary infections terminated at 3,6,9, or 13 days and multiple infections of 3
                    days duration confirmed the importance of direct gut stimulation and the period
                    of exposure in the induction of immunity and gut hypersensitivity. The studies
                    with the multiple 3-day infections confirmed that the third stage larvae alone
                    are capable of inducing strong protective immunity that is accompanied by
                    pronounced gut sensitivity to parasite extracts and secretions.</p>
                <p>Finally, two in bred guinea-pig lines selected for enhanced resistance or
                    susceptibility to T.colubriformis infection displayed corresponding high or low
                    capacities to mount hypersensitivity reactions following a single truncated

                <p>Activated mouse EC (50 units/ml IENY and 1 ng/ml LPS for 16 h) killed a maximum
                    of 89 % of schistosomules. However, human umbilical vein EC (HUVEC) failed to
                    kill schistosomules following incubation with a wide range of human recombinant
                    IFN # and LPS. Whether this difference is due to species-specificity, to the in

                    investigated.</p>
                <p>In contrast, incubation of the HUVEC with IFNŸ and LPS was found to significantly

                    added to washed cultures of IFN®# and LPS-activated (20 h) HUVEC and
                    proliferation was assessed by 3H-uracil incorporation, which is exclusive to the

                <p>gondii incorporated high levels of 3H-uracil (mean CPM 19000 +/- 2000) whereas

                    dose-dependent inhibitory effects of this mAb upon sGST. Passive transfer of
                    S13.38B1 ascites has demonstrated an about 60 % protection in Fischer rats
                    whereas only 25 to 35 % in BALB/c mice with marginal significances. Egg laying
                    studies both in vivo and in vitro (cultivating the normal adult schistosomes in
                    the presence of mAb) and ex vivo (cultivating the worm pairs perfused from
                    S13.38B1-transfered mice) have shown remarkably reduced worm fecondity. Egg
                    hatching experiments manifested that both in vivo and in vitro administration of
                    S13.38B1 mAb had retarded the egg embryonation and damaged the mature eggs as
                    well. These results indicated that the inhibition of schistosome GST activity by
                    immune response related in some aspects, especially in egg concerned biology and
                    immunopathology, to host immune defense mechanisms.</p>

                    plants to parasitic nematodes by an example of the system tomato - root-knot
                    nematode Meloidogyne incognita demonstrated that the invasion of roots leads to
                    changes in the biogenesis of terpenoids, which results in inhibition of
                    antibiotic sesquiterpenic compounds - rishitine and lubimine, accompanied by a
                    decrease in the level of sterols that are biogeneti- cally related to the
                    former. Such a shift in the content of final products of the terpenoid
                    biogenesis enhances the resistance of tomato to root-knot nematode, since in
                    this case the parasite loses a factor indispensable for its development
                    (phytohelminths are not capable of sterol autosynthesis) and at the same time
                    becomes sensitive to the action of sequiterpenic phytoalexins, the toxicity of
                    which with respect to phytonematodes was demonstrated previously (%Zinovjeva,

                    of Garber (Garber, 1956,1960) and the hypothesis of induced

                    (NHS) - Heterologous host resistance Host range specificity of trypanosomes
                    seems to depende mainly on specific and/or natural immune defenses of the
                    heterologous host. In the present paper, we provide evidence that normal human
                    serum (NHS) exhibits trypanolitic activity against T. brucei brucei as as-
                    sessed by in vivo and in vitro experiments. In particular the T. brucei brucei
                    strain DITAT 1,6, was maintained by in vivo passages in CD1 mice, injected
                    intraperitoneally with 2x107 parasites/mouse. The trypanolytic activity of the
                    NHS was assessed by a 2h in vitro incubation of the parasite in the presence of
                    50% NHS, followed by directe evalu- ation of T. brucei brucei mortality and
                    agglutination by inverted microscope. We found that NHS significantly affected
                    T. brucei brucei mobility and exhibited an agglutination titre of 4. In
                    contrast, normal mouse serum had no effects. In vivo studies we injected normal
                    and immunodeficient mice with various doses of T. brucei brucei and then admin-
                    istered different doses of NHS. We found that NHS conferred protection to both
                    sets of animals, which also showed a reduced parasitemia as compared to
                    NHS-untreated animals.</p>
                <p>By indirect imnunofluorescent assay (IFI) using monoclonal antibodies, we were
                    able to demonstrate that the NHS possessed high levels anti-T. brucei brucei
                    IgM, likely respon- sible for the trypanolytic effects observed. Furthermore, T.
                    brucei brucei expressed detectable levels of surface receptors for IgM and
                    complement fragment C1q. Kinetic stu- dies on sera from cordal blood and donors
                    of age ranging from 4 months to 80 years old showed that only sera of donors 6
                    months old exhibited anti T. brucei brucei IgM levels and in vivo protective
                    effects in T. brucei brucei challenged mice. These results demon strate that an
                    innate resistance to T. brucei brucei occurs in humans 6 months after birth,
                    which is likely mediated by IgM antibodies.</p>

                <p>Reactive oxygen intermediates - schistosome-snail compatibility Haemocytes of the
                    pond snail Lymnaea stagnalis generate reactive oxygen intermediates (ROIS) when
                    stimulated with non-self. To examine whether this is a functional aspect of the
                    immune defence against parasites, the following experiments were performed. The
                    ROI oroduction by L. stagnalis haemocytes encountering sporocysts of trematode
                    parasites, either Trichobilharzia ocellata (compatible) or Schistosoma mansoni
                    (incompatible), in vitro was monitored by chemiluminescence (CL) activity.
                    Sensitivity of the sporocysts for oxidative killing was determined by exposure
                    to artificially produced ROIS. Interactions with both parasite svecies elicited
                    CL-activity in the haemocytes; in these encounters S.</p>
                <p>mansoni was encaorsulated by the haemocytes and killed , whereas T.ocellata
                    escaped encap- sulation and survived the interaction. Both parasite species were
                    susceptible to killing by ROIS in vitro. This imnlies that ROIS can function in
                    killing of incompatible para- sites in vivo. The ability of a comnatible
                    parasite to evade effective encansulation may orevent it from coming in close
                    contact with cellular killing effectors among which ROIS.</p>

                    lead (0.01 mg and 0.1 mg / day / mouse for 15 days) on adaptive immunity was
                    assessèd in mice received peritoneal exudate, thymus, spleen and bone marrow
                    cells from immunised donors. All experimental recipients showed significantly
                    greater worm burden and reduced globulin levels at both cysticercoid (day 4) and
                    adult worm (day 20) stages. Suppression was maximum in recipients with thymus
                    cells, supports the view that T cells are primarily and severely affected by

                    infection with 300 larvae of Trichinella spiralis or Trichinella pseudospiralis
                    was studied. Skin from normal C57BL/6J mice were transplanted on infected Balb/c
                    mice at days 3, 10, 20, 30 and 12 months post infection The clinical criteria
                    for graft rejection, scaring and graft falling, was followed. The results
                    obtained indicated that Trichinella spiralis and T. pseudospiralis infections
                    induced a significant delay in graft rejection when compared to the control
                    group. A maximum delay of 25 days was observed in infected CS57BL/6J mice which
                    received skin grafts from Balb/c mice on day 3 post infection The reiection in
                    the uninfected control group was on day 7 post transplant The rejection was also
                    delayed for 16, 21 and 19 days following transplantation on days 10, 20 and 30
                    respectively. The rejection profile in Balb/c mice was comparable to that
                    observed in C57BL/6J mice. A delay of 21, 14, 10 and 10 days were reported
                    following transplantation on days 3, 10, 20 and 30 post infection respectively.
                    In an attempt to test for the immunodepression during the adult phase of the
                    parasite, skin grafts were performed 5 or 10 days prior to the infection. In
                    this group, the rejection occurred on day 7 as was the case for the control
                    group.</p>
                <p>In conclusion, it was observed that infections with T. spiralis or T.
                    pseudospiralis induces a significant delay in skin graft rejection in mice. The
                    delay was maximum during the adult and migratory (new born larvae) phases. No
                    significant difference was observed in the rejection patterns induced by either
                    parasite.</p>

                    To elucidate the immunological determinants of compatibility between
                    schistosomes and their intermediate hosts, we studied -in vivo and in vitro-
                    general aspects of immune activities in Lymnaea stagnalis, uninfected and in the
                    course of infection with Trichobilharzia ocellata.</p>
                <p>Flow-cytometrical studies showed that the distribution of cell size of the
                    circulating haemocytes -nrimary defence cells- in suspension is consistent
                    within the host population and indenendent of infection. Morphometrical studies
                    using monoclonal antibodies however, indicated that spreading behaviour of
                    haemocytes as recognized by monoclonal antibodies is influenced by the
                    infection. Functional studies on changes in phagocytical activity, studied in
                    vitro, showed a shift from effects mediated by humoral factors, early in the
                    infection, to cell-bound changes, later.</p>
                <p>Regarding anti-trematode activity the following steps can be distinguished:
                    chemotaxis,recognition/adherence, recruitment of additional
                    haemocytes/encapsulation and killing/clearing. We made use of a modyfied
                    Boyden-chamber method to study possible modulation of the first step
                    (chemotaxis). No difference was found between the reaction of haemocytes to
                    secretions/excretions of a compatible parasite (T. ocellata) and those of an
                    incompatible one (Schistosoma mansoni). Further studies will concentrate on the
                    subsequent steps in anti-trematode activity.</p>

                    using specific monoclonal antibodies (Behring OKT3, OKT4, and OKT8). The levels
                    of total paripheral blood T-cel1s were within the same range as those of normal
                    children (73.08+3.96 vs. 71.67+3.80). However, the population of OKT4 positive
                    cells were slightly higher than in the controls (54.45+6.63 vs. 47.84+3.80)
                    while the levels of OKT8 positive cells were slightly lower than the controls

                <p>24.7É+3.06). The T4/T8 ratio were respectively 2.77+0.93 for the patients and

                    the immunosuppression which is observ- ed in these patients could be due to

                <p>Trypanosoma congolense-antigenes immunodominants-trypanotolerance Nous avons
                    idenfifié les antigènes de Trypanosoma congolense qui induisent la synthèse
                    d'anticorps chez les bovins, et recherché une éventuelle association entre la
                    reconnaissance de certains antigènes et la résistance à la maladie. La réponse
                    immune de 5 N'Damas (race trypanotolérante) et de 5 Zébus borans
                    (trypanosensibles) a été étudiée par la technique du Western-blott au cours
                    d'une réinfection expérimentale par T. congolense, clone IL13-E3. Les divers
                    antigènes de T. congolense sont principalement reconnus par des anticorps de
                    classe IgGI. Trois antigènes immunodominants (69kDa, 35kDa, 23kDa) ont été
                    identifiés. Les réponses aux protéines de 69kDa et 35kDa sont différentes dans
                    les 2 races. La protéine de 69kDa est reconnue très precocément par tous les
                    animaux, chez qui elle iñduit la synthèse d'anticorps de classes IgG1, 19G2 et
                    IgM, mais la réponse IgGI1 est quantitativement plus importante chez les N'Damas
                    que chez les Borans. Des anticorps anti-35kDa sont présents avant la réinfection
                    chez tous les N'Damas et chez 2 des 3 Borans qui ont résisté à cette infection,
                    mais pas chez les 2 Borans qui ont dû être traités. L'étude rétrospective de
                    l'infection primaire des mêmes animaux, effectuée en 1985 à l'aide d'une autre
                    souche de T.</p>
                <p>congolense, montre que la protéine de 35kDa a été reconnue par tous les N'Damas
                    mais par aucun des Borans au cours de la primo-infection. On a également montré
                    que les buffles, qui sont naturellement resistants aux trypanosomoses,
                    reconnaissent cette protéine au cours d'une infection expérimentale. La
                    reconnaissan-e de la protéine 35kDa de T. congolense paraît donc associée à la
                    résistance à la maladie.</p>

                <p>Nippostrongylus brasiliensis Platelet Activating Factor.</p>
                <p>Platelet Activating Factor (PAF) is a potent immune modulator known to be a
                    central mediator in inflammation. We have shown that i) Incubation of PAF with
                    secreted products of immature (L4) worms causes loss of activity, as measured by
                    platelet aggregation ii) This loss of activity is concentration and time
                    dependent and is therefore consistent with enzymatic catabolism of PAF. It is
                    possible that this activity may serve to inhibit or delay expulsion of worms
                    from the Gastro- intestinal tract. Preliminary studies using enzyme inhibitors
                    suggest that the catabolic activity observed may be consistent with that
                    previously described as "Acetylcholinesterase". We are further studying this
                    phenomenon using affinity purified enzyme and are in the process of cloning
                    relevant genes using monospecific antisera.</p>

                    membrane fluidity of Hymenolepis diminuta, Hymenolepis microstoma and
                    Hymenolepis nana. Membranes were labelled with a series of fluorescent lipid
                    analogues, e.g. Aminofluorecin, Merocyanin, and lateral diffusion coefficients
                    were measured. Newly excysted, 4 day, 7 day and 12 day old worms were examined.
                    Preliminary investigations have revealed regions (i.e. scolex/neck) of
                    restricted lateral diffusion in H. diminuta.</p>

                    MAJOR INFECTIONS VARIES WITH THE PRESENCE OF INTERFERON OR INTERLEUKIN-4

                    major, cytokine interaction In the course of a Leishmania (L.) major infection
                    we found that highly susceptible BALB/c mice are primed to elicit higher amounts
                    of tumor necrosis factor « (TNF) and interleukin 4 (I1-4) as compared to
                    resistant C57BL/6 mice. On the other hand, C57BL/6 mice developed a strong
                    interferon y (IFNy) response upon L.major-infections, whereas in
                    L.major-infected BALB/c-mice hardly any IFNy-producing T-lymphocytes were found.
                    These in vivo-results prompted us to investigate the in vitro-effect of TNF
                    (alone or in combination with other cytokines) on adherent peritoneal exudate
                    macrophages (MO) infected with L.major amastigotes. The number of intracellular
                    parasites was determined by a fluorescence microscopy technique.</p>
                <p>In the absence of significant amounts of LPS (&lt; 0.6 ng/ml culture medium) TNF
                    alone (0.025-25 000 U/nl) failed to activate the M-monolayers for killing of
                    intracellular parasites. However, in the presence of suboptimal dosages (5 or 10
                    U/mIl) of IFNy (which alone were ineffective) TNF induced a rapid elimination of
                    the parasites in a dose-dependent manner. This synergistic effect was not
                    observed when the M9 were pretreated with IFNy alone and only afterwards
                    incubated with TNF. On the other hand, TNF in combination with IL-4 did not
                    activate M9 for killing of L.major amastigotes and rather caused an increased
                    burden of intracellular parasites as compared to IL-4 alone. Extracellular
                    L.major parasites were not affected by TNF.</p>
                <p>From these data we conclude that the functional role of TNF in murine L.major
                    infections depends on the availability of other lymphokines: In resistant mice
                    it synergizes with IFNYy and promotes parasite elimination, whereas in
                    susceptible mice, which elicit a strong IL 4-response, but virtually lack IFNy,
                    TNF supports parasite survival.</p>

                    using variable proportions of CD4+/CD8+ cells is associated preferentially with

                <p>We have previously shown that the induction of cell-mediated immune responses
                    correlate with resistance to challenge Schistosoma mansoni infection in mice
                    vaccinated once with irradiated cercariae whereas others have implicated humoral
                    resistance mechanisms by demonstrating that sera from multiply vaccinated mice
                    can transfer protection. In order to identify the subsets of T helper cell (TH1,
                    TH2 ) involved in these mechanisms, we have compared the reactivity of
                    lymphocytes in C57B1/6 mice vaccinated either once (1X) or three times (3X) with
                    500 50 Krirradiated cercariae . Levels of IFN produced by spleen or lymph node
                    cells from 1X-vaccinated mice upon in vitro stimulation with schistosome
                    antigens were approximately 100% higher than those produced by cells from
                    3X-vaccinated animals under equivalent conditions. Levels of IL-2 produced by
                    lymphocytes from 1X-vaccinated mice under the same conditions were 50% higher
                    than those produced by 3X-vaccinated mice. In contrast, IL-5 production was
                    two-fold higher by cells from 3X-vaccinated mice. Moreover, sera from 3X-
                    vaccinated mice contained higher levels of IgG1 antibodies than 1X-vaccinated
                    mice. The hyperimmune mice presented increased numbers of peritoneal eosinophils
                    after antigen elicitation; however, their peritoneal macrophages demonstrated
                    significant antibody- independent larvacidal activity . These observations are
                    consistent with the hypothesis that a single vaccination with irradiated
                    cercariae preferentially stimulates the TH1 subset of lymphocytes involved in
                    IFN y production and macrophage activation, whereas multiple immunization
                    increases TH2 activity involved in eosinophilia and B cell help for IgG1.</p>

                    phagocytic Biomphalaria glabrata hemocytes reportedly produce superoxide (O2-).
                    The purpose of this study was: 1) To quantify O:- production in Schistosoma
                    mansoni susceptible (M-line) and resistant (10-R2) strains of B. glabrata and 2)
                    To assess the effect of S, mansoni excretory-secretory products (ES) on hemocyte
                    O:- production and phagocytosis. The ability of SOD and larval ES to inhibit
                    hemocyte O-, in the presence or absence of snail plasma, was tested in an in
                    vitro phagocytosis assay using Zymosan as test particles. In the absence of
                    plasma, SOD did not affect phagocytosis in either M-line or 10-R2 hemocytes at
                    0.5, 1.5, or 3.0 U/ul. However, a significant decrease in formazan formation
                    occurred in 10-R2 cells at &gt; 1.5 U/ul while reductions occurred at &gt; 0.5
                    U/ul in M-line hemocytes. These reductions were due to the specific action of
                    SOD, since the inactivated apoenzyme of SOD failed to inhibit formazan formation
                    or phagocytosis. ES decreased phagocytosis and formazan formation in both
                    strains in the absence of piasma, with M-line hemocytes having a greater
                    reduction in formazan formation than 10-R2 cells. In the presence of plasma, ES
                    did not affect NBT reduction in M-line cells but did so in those of 10-R2
                    snails. Several ES polypeptides with SOD-like activity have been identified,
                    including a 108 kDa molecule. These results confirm previous reports that
                    hemocytes of B. glabrata produce O;- following phagocytic stimulation. In
                    addition, $. mansoni ES contain molecules with SOD-like activity. Moreover,
                    susceptible and resistant snail strains appear to respond differently to SOD and
                    to S. mansoni ES relative to the presence or absence of plasma opsonizing

                    to contain circulating agglutinins that may function in immunological nonself
                    recognition upon exposure to the trematode Echinostoma paraensei. Studies of the
                    plasma of exposed 6 mm juvenile and 12 mm adult snaïls have shown significantly
                    elevated titers of agglutinating activity using fresh rabbit erythrocytes as

                <p>Agglutinating activity can be inhibited by certain carbohydrates, suggesting it
                    is lectin-mediated.</p>
                <p>Therefore, we have examined the ability of two monosaccharides [L-fucose and
                    N-acetyl-galactosamine (GalNAc)] to inhibit agglutination in both control and E,
                    paraensei-exposed snails (8 days post- exposure). It was found that L-fucose is
                    a strong inhibitor of agglutinating activity in 6 mm snails with
                    intraventricular sporocyst infections and in exposed 12 mm snails; snails in the
                    latter size group typically fail to become infected. GalNAc was a weak inhibitor
                    in the 6 mm snaiïls and showed comparable inhibitory activity to that of
                    L-fucose in the 12 mm snaïls. In both 6 mm and 12 mm control snaïls, GalNAc
                    completely inhibits agglutination whereas L-fucose has little effect. To purify
                    the agglutinin molecules, an L-fucose affinity chromatography column was used;
                    molecules specifically eluted from the column with L-fucose were found to have
                    agglutinating activity and were shown by SDS-PAGE to have a molecular weight
                    range of 80-120 kD. Additional agglutinating activity was observed from
                    fractions subsequently eluted from the column with GalNAc. The results suggest
                    that exposure to E. paraensei produces a change in the agglutinin composition of
                    host hemolymph.</p>

                    immunosuppressive factors The protozoon Toxoplasma gondii is an obligately
                    intracellular pathogen which, once in the organism, remains there for the entire
                    life of its host, the host-parasite balance being established mainly through
                    cellu- lar immunologic mechanisms. The parasite itself has the ability to modu-
                    late the immunoreactivity of its host. As a sensitive test for detecting serum
                    immunosuppressive factors (SIF) of lectin-induced T cell prolifera- tion in
                    patients with acute Toxoplasma infection, we used the modulation of the

                    serum and 5% control serum. Sera from 18 patients (12 M and 6F, 6-49 years old)

                    first two weeks after the onset of symptoms were tested and compared with those
                    obtained in age and sex matched controls. Our results showed that all patients

                    suppressed the lectin-induced T cell proliferation. The inhibitory activity was
                    heat-resistant and was not due to the cytotoxic effect. Further studies are

                    in the CL lesions, 80% of the lesions showed bacterial contamination that

                    patients. Unfortunately, because of lack of both in vivo laboratory models and

                    days post infection (d.p.i.). The effect was most marked on mononuclear cells
                    isolated from the lymph node.</p>
                <p>Following this immunosuppressive phase an antigenic-specific proliferative
                    response was observed in splenic cells and PBMs. This response was transient in
                    Boran cattle whereas N'Dama cattle maintained this response (albeit at a lower
                    level) up to 40 d.p.i. The highest parasite-antigen driven proliferative
                    responses were seen in N'Dama PBMs isolated at around 20 d.p.i. At this time the
                    PBMs not only responded to antigens derived from the infecting serodeme (IL1180)
                    but also from another serodeme (IL3000), whereas Boran PBMs responded to IL1180
                    only.</p>
                <p>These results suggest that there are differences in the parasite antigens

                <p>H-2, cysticercosis, susceptibility Having shown that mice carrying H-2d haplotype
                    sustain growth of T. crassiceps much better than many other strains of other
                    haplotypes (b,k) a search for H-2 gene products in the parasite was conducted to
                    examine the possibility that correct matching in histocompatibility antigens
                    between host and parasite may be involved ïin the establishment and growth of
                    parasites in cysticercosis. Indeed, H-2d and H-2b antigens were both found in
                    parasites grown in H-2d and H-2b BALB mice by way of an inhibitory ELISA
                    assay.</p>
                <p>However, previous immunization of BALB/c (H-2d) mice with H-2b congenic mouse
                    cells did not significantly induced protection against challenge with parasites
                    grown in either H-2d or H-2b mice. In contrast, immunization of H-2b mice with
                    H-2d cells dramatically curtailed parasite growth after challenge with parasites
                    grown in either mouse strain. Thus, our results point to the ability to
                    immunologically respond to H-2d gene products as an important factor in the
                    establishment of T. crassiceps cysticercus in the mouse, and suggest that the
                    presence of MHC-like molecules in the parasite, similar to those of the host, is
                    not be a random or an irrelevant event.</p>

                <p>Ascaris MHC control immune recognètion The parasitic nematode Ascaris
                    lumbricoides is now thought to infect 1000 million people worldwide and is a
                    chronic infection where the immune response is not apparently effective in
                    eliminating the parasite. Studies on serum from endemic areas has shown
                    differential recognition of parasite antigens and especially to ABA- 1 (Adult
                    Body Fluid Allergen 1), an allergen, which has implications for the pathology nf
                    the disease. Recognition of antigens frorn the closely related porcine homologue
                    Ascaris suum has been shown to be under MHC control although it is quite
                    unexpected that you should get MHC restricted recognition to large molecules of
                    a parasite.</p>
                <p>The 196 responses of a panel of congenic mice which had been given infective
                    Ascar is e9gs were examined by means of immunoprecipitation of radiolabelled per
                    ienter ic fluid (ABF) of Asuum followed by SDS-PAGE gel analysis and
                    autoradiography Classically the Class 2 genes have been shown to be responsible
                    for controlling the specificity of the antibody response. The response to ABA- 1
                    by the different congenic strains was MHC restricted and analysis of recombinant
                    strains allowed elimination of H-2D as the controlling region. It was also
                    possible to eliminate H-2 Ex control and p:55ibly H-2E$ control of immune
                    recognition. No suitable congenics are available which would allow
                    identification of H-2K as the controlling region or allow it to be eliminated,
                    Thus this study strongly suggests that recognition of the ABA- 1 molecule is
                    under control of the Ca55 2 genes in the murine system.</p>

                <p>T cell lines and clones generated were stable for up to 6 months and retained
                    their antigen specificity. Three different antigen preparations were used in the

                    evaluation of their role in parasite-intermediate host immune interactions,
                    glycoconjugate structures of the cell coat of haemocytes in the pond snail

                    developed to quantify the lectin binding sites and to determine the affinity

                    carbohydrate structures specifically binding certain lectins.</p>
                <p>Experimentally altering the carbohydrate configuration on the parasite's surface,
                    using glycohydrolases and lectins binding (sub)terminal carbohydrate moieties,
                    rendered a compatible parasite susceptible to the immune defence of the snail
                    host. In conclusion, the glycoconjugate surface composition could play an
                    important role in the strategies employed by the parasite to survive within its

                    in the acute intestinal inflammatory response thought to be responsible for
                    expulsion of the parasite from the qut. With inbred mice it can be shown that
                    there is extensive strain dependent variation associated with infection, incl-
                    uding work expulsion, with both MHC and background gene involvement. Genes at
                    the D end of the MHC have been shoun to exert a marked influence upon the rate
                    of worm expulsion.</p>
                <p>The genes coding for the cytokines tumour necrosis factor-X and lymphotoxin also
                    map to this region. Using recombinant mouse strains showing different response
                    phenotypes, TNF- x, and LT production has been measured following infection. It
                    was found that worm expulsion could be associated with production of these
                    cytokines, and an attempt has been made to correlate expression of "resistant"
                    or "susceptible" alleles at the "D" end of the MHC with the capacity to produce
                    inflammatory cytokines.</p>

                <p>Cell-mediated immune responses of 16 acute P. falciparum patients from an area of
                    unstable malaria in Eastern Sudan were followed in vitro. Bloodsamples were
                    drawn at time of diagnosis (day 0), and 7 and 30 days later. The respon- ses
                    were compared to responses obtained using bloodsamples from the same donors
                    drawn either 5 months prior to the attack, or 12 months following
                    reconvalescence.</p>
                <p>Prior to the attack 10/13 donors showed a significant proliferative response to a
                    preparation of purified soluble P.</p>
                <p>falciparum antigens (SPag), and all donors responded to PPD and PHA. At day 0,
                    12/16 donors were unable to respond significantly to SPag, and responses to PPD
                    were markedly depressed. In contrast, PHA responses were unaffected. At day 7,
                    9/13 and 10/13 donors responded significantly to SPag and PPD respectively, and
                    by day 30, 5/13 and 7/13 responded. Four donors were parasitaemic at day 30,
                    none of whom reponded to SPag and only 1 to PPD. Three donors bled 12 months
                    later all had significant responses to SPag, PPD and PHA.</p>
                <p>The fact that most donors showed a strong proliferative response to SPag prior to
                    the attack, shows that the failing responses to antigenic stimulation in
                    peripheral blood mononuclear cells from acute patients was indeed
                    disease-related, rather than reflecting acquisition of immunity.</p>

                    in affected sheep biting and rubbing at the fleece, which can produce
                    significant fleece damage. Skin biopsies collected from ïinfested sheep, fixed
                    in neutral buffered formalin, sectioned and stained with giemsa chromotrop,
                    revealed increased numbers of dermal mast cells in infested sheep and
                    significantly more mast cells in sheep infested with a high (&gt;10 mites per
                    200 cm2 of skin area) mite population density than in sheep with a low (1- 10
                    mites per 200cm2) mite population density. Sheep with no detectable mite
                    infestation were challenged with mites and dermal mast cell numbers increased in
                    some animals after challenge, apparently in response to successful establishment
                    of mite infestations. No significant differences were found in the numbers of
                    neutrophils and eosinophils in the dermis between infested and uninfested sheep.
                    There was no difference in overall skin thickness of formalin fixed sections
                    between infested and uninfested sheep, but infested sheep have significantly
                    more scurf on the cornified layer at the skin surface than uninfested sheep and
                    this layer is largely removed during processing. Western blot tests on sera from
                    ïinfested sheep indicated that they produced an antibody response to P.ovis
                    infestation and that the response may differ with different levels of

                    (day 0) or double (days 0 and 37) infection with 7000 H. con- tortus L, was
                    studied. The post mortem worm count was considered to be the nost diréct
                    measurement of the response. Lambs harbouring more than 500 or less than 50
                    adult worms were classified as low (LR) or h‘5h responders CHR),
                    respectively.</p>
                <p>Worm counts of a primary infection were found to be more subject to varia- tion
                    than those of a chaïilenge. Adult worm counts at around 50 days after a
                    secondary infection appear to aliow LR and HR discrimination. However, for this
                    parameter the animals have to be slaughtered. By régression analysis a strong
                    relationship (r=0.769) was found between adult worm counts and faecal egg counts
                    taken close to the time of slaughter. Haematocrit values (r=0.028), haemoglobin
                    concentration and total serum protein values did not prove to be useful
                    parameter in the selection of LR and HR individuals.</p>
                <p>Although primary infection induced partial immunity to chailenge, this was not

                    levels of LR lambs showed no difference from thôse of HRs. It is proposed that
                    in living aninals LR and HR selection can be based on indi- vidual faecal egg
                    counts around 50 days after a secondary infection.</p>

                    Division of Parasitology, Central Drug Research Institute, Lucknow, INDIA Key
                    words: À. ceylanicum, hamsters, immunomodulation, histamine, immunoassay The
                    worm-expulsion till recently was considered histamine (hm) dependent. This claim
                    has now been refuted as the course of Nippostrongylus brasiliensis in mast cell
                    sufficient mice (+/+) and mast cell deficient mice (w/w) was found similar?
                    Administration of exogenous hm, Comp.48/80 and L-histidine prolonged the course
                    of parasitism and antihistaminics and semicarbazide failed to alter the progress
                    of infection . These evidences suggest that hm adversely affects the immune
                    functions of the host. To substantiate this experimentally the role of hm on
                    susceptibility and immune functions of hamsters resistant to Ancylostoma
                    ceylanicum was investigated.</p>
                <p>The administration of hm (20mg base/hamster x 6 days, i.p) made the immune ham-
                    sters susceptible and on challenge they developed 34.06+2.98 worms against 1.56
                    +0.32 worms only in untreated immune hamsters (P&lt;0.001). The immune hm
                    treated hamsters also showed suppressed humoral and CMI responses. In ELISA the
                    OD values at all concentrations examined were found low in hm treated animals
                    compared to untreated ones (OD-0.0908 in treated against 0.264 in untreated
                    animals at 1:3200 conc.).</p>
                <p>The DTH reaction to SRBC as evaluated by foot pad thickness was also considerably
                    reduced (P &lt;0.01). Macrophage function (NBT reduction by PECg) remained
                    unaltered.</p>
                <p>These parameters in unimmunized hm treated hamsters remained unchanged. The find-
                    ings provide definite evidence that hm suppresses specific immune response and
                    con- trary to earlier reports this neurotransmitter does not play direct role in
                    worm expulsion.</p>

                    lamblia trophozoites load in the intestine of infected mice accompanied
                    pronounced influx of suppressor/cytotoxic T cells (Lyt 2.2+), T cells (Thy 1.2+)
                    and significant reduction in IgA containing cells in the gut during the
                    establishment and peak phases of infection. The induction of helper/inducer T
                    cells (Lyt 1.1*) and significant enhancement of IgA containing cells in gut
                    resulted in the decline of the trophozoites loads. The prior treatment of
                    animals with dexamethasone alone though resulted in significantly reduction in
                    helper/inducer T cells (Lyt 2.2?) and the IgA containing cells in the gut, the
                    percent of suppressor/éytotoxic T cells (Lyt 2.2+) and the number of IgM
                    containing cells remained unaltered. The significant reduction in the
                    trophozoites load despite imnunosuppressive therapy appeared to be due to
                    unaltered IgM response in such animals which acted as secondary line of defense
                    against G. lamblia. The data of the investigation, thus suggested a role of
                    helper/ inducer T cells and antibodies producing cells in gut as an important
                    effector cells resulting in the termination of primary G. lamblia infection.</p>

                    previously reported that co-culture of blood forms of T. cruzi with
                    mitogen-activated human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) suppresses
                    lymphoproliferation and the expression of several molecules involved in
                    lymphocyte activation, including receptors for interleukin-2 (IL-2R). In the
                    present work, we co-cultured T. cruzi trypomastigotes with PBMC stimulated with
                    anti-CD2, plus anti-CD2, monoclonal antibodies, i.e., an antigen-independent
                    pathway of lymphocyte activatidn, and observed a marked degree of
                    immunosuppression compared to parallel cultures in which the parasite was not
                    present. This effect was evidenced by decreased proliferative responses measured
                    in terms of “H-thymidine incorporation, a significant reduction in the
                    proportion of cells expressing IL-2R, and a significant diminution in the cell
                    surface density of this receptor. Thus, we were able to show that T. cruzi,
                    which suppresses human lymphocyte responses triggered by T cell specific
                    mitogens such as phytohemagglutinin, concanavalin À and anti-CD3 monoclonal

                    Parasite proteases present in both the excretory,secretory (ES) products and
                    homogenates of the parasite were detected in situ usina SDS-PAGE casein
                    substrate gels. The release of acetylcholinesterase (ACRhE) into the ES and the
                    amount present in homogenates of the various stages of the parasite was
                    assessed.</p>
                <p>A number of stage specific molecules were identified on the cuticle of the
                    parasite. Parasite proteases were secreted in gqreatest quantities from days 1-4
                    post infection (p.i). The number of enzymes present was also maximal at this
                    time p.i. The release of AChE was areatest between days 4 and 6 p.i.</p>
                <p>It was concluded that the proteases secreted were necessary for the invasion of
                    the host mucosa by the third larval stage, the AChE was required for the
                    immunomodulatiom of the host by the tissue dwelling fourth larval stage and
                    lumen dwelling adult. The increased comolexitv of the cuticular molecules may
                    also have contributed to the modulation of the host immune response. Mice which
                    had expelled a primary infection of the parasite recognised a number of

                    forming enzyme) (J. Immunol., 1987, 139 : 3710).</p>
                <p>IL-3 production in vivo and its effects on histamine synthesis in hematopoietic
                    organs were investigated in the Nippostrongylus Brasiliensis infected mice
                    model. Antigenic challenge of infected mice induces a striking increase in HDC
                    activity in both spleen and bone marrow cells. This enhancement takes place
                    within 1 hour after injection, with a maximum at 4 hours and a return to
                    pretreatment values 24 hours later. A similar injection of worm antigen into
                    normal mice has no effect. This HDC activity increase is correlated with the
                    appearance of IL-3 in the sera of these mice. The involvement of mature
                    mast-cells or endotoxin have been ruled out since similar results were obtained
                    in W/Wv (mast-cell deficient) or C3H/Hej (low LPS responder) mice. On the other
                    hand, comparable enhancement of HDC activity and intracellular histamine content
                    with almost identical kinetics is promoted by i.v. injection of r-IL-3 into
                    normal mice. Moreover, HDC levels in infected mice are increased to the same
                    extent in response to either specific antigen or r-IL-3 injection. Our results
                    support the conclusion that antigenic challenge of immunized mice induces
                    endogeneous IL-3 which, in turn, promotes a rapid increase in histamine
                    synthesis in hematopoietic organs.</p>

                    of the thymus in mice undergoing acute Trypanosoma cruzi infection, we reported
                    sever thymocyte depletion characterized by alterations in phenotype pattern
                    regarding the expression of CD4, CD8 and CD3 antigens. This prompted us to
                    investigate the functional status of these thymic lymphocyte. Intraperitoneal
                    infection of young adult C57BL/6 mice with 10° blood forms of T. cruzi (CL
                    strain) induced the appearance of thymocyte cytotoxic effector cells (CTL),
                    detectable in a lectin-dependent Slcr-release assay, since 1h day
                    post-infection. Concerning spontaneous and Concanavalin A-induced proliferative
                    activity, we observed a decrease in thymocyte proliferation, most striking on
                    day 14 post-infection. When we analysed the absolute numbers of CD4+CD8-
                    thymocytes, we noted a constant diminution during the infection. In contrast,
                    when CD4-CD8+ cells were studied, the low numbers detected on day 11 were
                    followed by recovery to normal values on day 14. These data suggest that the
                    CD4-CD8+ cells may be involved in the control of thymocyte proliferative
                    response after acute infection. Furthermore our results bring strong evidence
                    for the concept that alterations occuring in thymocytes following T. cruzi
                    infection, besides being phenotypical are also functional S5.C 47 P.</p>

                    immunobiology, larval trematodes One proposed mechanism whereby larval
                    trematodes initiate and establish successful infections in their molluscan hosts
                    is to secrete/excrete factors that interfere with the hosts internal defense
                    system. To test this hypothesis, in vitro-transformed sporocysts of Echinostoma
                    paraensei were allowed to condition protein-free culture medium over a period of
                    at least four days. Conditioned medium was withdrawn at 24 hr intervals, and was
                    concentrated ten-fold by ultrafiltration. Effects of both ultrafiltration

                    snails were tested in phagocytosis assays usine fixed sheep red blood cells as
                    target cells. Hemocytes exposed to retentates from media conditioned during the
                    first day of culture had significantly lower phagocytic activity than hemocytes
                    exposed to control medium. Phagocytic activity of hemocytes exposed to medium
                    from day 2 cultures was difficult to assess because of apparent detachment of
                    hemocytes during the assay. Further study revealed that retentates from day 2-4
                    cultures contain factors that prevent hemocytes from spreading normally on
                    either glass or plastic surfaces. This activity was associated with factors
                    greater than 100 kd that could be heat-inactivated. Hemocytes preincubated for
                    10 min in retentates of 2-4 day cultures had drastically lowered rates of
                    phagocytosis as compared to hemocytes preincubated in control medium. Hemocvtes

                    comprises a longitudinal immunological, clinical and parasitological survey of
                    ca.1600 individuals resident in a forest area of Sierra Leone, hyperendemic for
                    onchocerciasis. The project includes a community-based placebo-controlled trial
                    with ivermectin. The immunological aspects involve analyses of both cellular and
                    humoral responses which we have sought to correlate with individuals' clinical
                    and parasitological status. At the cellular level we have demonstrated that
                    infection with Onchocerca volvulus is associated with a state of generalised
                    immunosuppression.</p>
                <p>This is exemplified by hyporesponsiveness to both parasite-related and unrelated
                    antigens. In addition, there is an apparent correlation between manifestations
                    of acute dermal reactivity. Data collected to date indicate that repeated
                    treatment with ivermectin has no substantial long-term effect on cellular
                    responses. Possible reasons for this, including the results of cytokine assays,

                    analyses of peripheral blood failed to reveal an association between the

                <p>Antigen B. (AgB) is an immunodominant component of Taenia solium during the
                    natural infec tion in humans and animels: most of the individuals have specific
                    antibodies against it, in serum. The aim of the present work was to compare the
                    processing of AgB and a crude extract (CE) of de cysticerci, by the macrophage
                    cell line J774. Macrophages were incu- bated at 37°C with AgB or CE for
                    different times and anelysed by enzyne innunoelectro transfer blott (EITB) with
                    antibodies against AgB or CE. It wes observed that the macro- pheges capture AgB
                    after few minutes of incubation, but require hours in orden to start its
                    processing; this last time can be evercomed if AgB is given to mecrophages
                    labelled with fiuorescein.</p>
                <p>From the whole CE, the macrophages bind only two proteins, one of them being AgB
                    and the other a nolecule of higher nolecular weight. The preferrec binding of
                    AgB fron de CE by this cell line may partially explain the immunodorinance of
                    this antigen during the cys- ticercotic process.</p>

                    lower in a group of individuals resident in a malaria endemic region of Sri
                    Lanka in comparison to another group who did not have a life-long exposure to
                    malaria but had acquired the disease on a visit to an endemic region. Both
                    groups responded equally well to mitogen. To a non malarial antigen PPD, the
                    responses were only marginally lower in the "endemic" group. Thus exposure to
                    endemic vivax malaria had led to suppression of the T-cell responses which was
                    most marked to P,vivax antigens. The PBMC responses to the cloned antigens PV200
                    and GAM-1 were generally low in all individuals. Antibodies to GAM-1, a target
                    of transmission blocking immunity assayed in an ELISA were rare in
                    acute-infection sera, but antibodies to PV200 were present in the sera of 94% of
                    patients. Transmission blocking immunity was assessed in 236 acute infection
                    sera in membrane feeding assays. Transmission blocking effects were much higher
                    and infectivity enhancing effects much lower in residents of a non endemic
                    region compared to residents of an endemic region, despite the latter being
                    exposed to a frequent antigenic challenge. These findings suggest that long-term
                    exposure to endemic malaria causes immunosuppression of the host to mdlarial
                    antigens.</p>

                    Nippostrongylus, Nematoda The immunosuppressive effects of azathioprine in
                    experimental infections of black-hooded rats with N. brasilensis_ were studied
                    by standard laboratory techniques and by mathematical modeling with solid
                    geometrical analysis. Study parameters included larval penetration, fecundity,
                    fertility, and host intestinal kinetics. Azathioprine-treated hosts had higher
                    initial egg counts, reached higher maximum counts, and had longer periods of egg
                    production than lactose-treated rats. Significantly more adult worms were
                    recovered at 24 days postinfection (PI) from the duodenums of
                    azathioprine-treated rats, but at 28 days PI approximately the same number were
                    recovered from both treatment groups. Regardless of host sex or treatment, worms
                    recovered at 24 days PI were predominately female, whereas worms recovered at 28
                    days PI were mostly male. Higher initial egg counts observed in
                    azathioprine-treated rats could be correlated with a reduction in the skin
                    inflammatory response, allowing greater numbers of larvae to develop into
                    adults. Physical examination of the nodules at the inoculation sites and
                    analysis using solid geometry revealed that the total volume occupied was
                    generally larger in control animals where more entrapped larvae were found. TEM
                    revealed that worms recovered from control hosts at 28 days PI had sustained
                    severe structural damage with reproductive and other organ systems intensely
                    vacuolated and lipid-abundant. Worms from azathioprine- treated hosts at 28 days
                    PI showed virtual absence of structural damage. Young adult worms recovered on
                    day 7 PI showed no damage. Ultrastructural differences between azathioprine-
                    treated and control rats could be correlated with the duration of their patency
                    periods. These findings suggest that azathioprine temporarily suppresses
                    antibody damage and cell mediated expulsion and furthur confirms that damage to
                    the worm is due to the host immune response and not to senescence of the
                    worm.</p>

                    this parasite modulates the immune response in some way, a dialyzable factor of

                <p>In cultures of phytohemagglutinin-stimulated human lymphocytes, this fraction
                    induced a lower incorporation of (3H)-thymidine than that produced by

                    material in non-stimulated lymphocytes. The fraction appeared to be composed of
                    oligonucleotides of RNA because, after the material had been treated with RNase
                    "A", the suppressive activity was lost. However, after the RNase digestion, it

                    doses); while at lower doses (20 ug, five doses), it showed a stimulative

                <p>F1 lost its depressive capability when it was digested with RNase in presence of

                    evidenced after the challenge of mice with 10 LD5Q of Salmonella typhimurium

                    spontaneously during its storage at -20°C, even when it was lyophilized, and it
                    was acquiring a stimulative activity, although, in a lower degree than that
                    induced by the RNase digested F1. À great mortality was correlated with a high

                    Leishmania major-reactive ct T cells secreting IL-2, IL-4 or IFN-y were
                    determined in resisçant and in susceptible mice at various times of infection.
                    The frequencies of CD4 cells producing IFN-y; which has been associated with Thl
                    cells, were much higher in resistant than in susceptible mice, whereas the
                    reverse was found for T cells with the capacity to secrete IL-4. On the other
                    hand, CD4 cells releasing IL-2, suggested to be another characteristic of Thl
                    cells, could be detected in both resistant and susceptible mice at any time of
                    infection. In addition, both IL-2 and IL-4 were found to be released by
                    individual T cell populations from susceptible mice. Genetically susceptible
                    BALB/c mice that were protected against cutaneous leishmaniasis by prophylactic
                    treatment displayed healer characteristics in terms of their lymphokine activity
                    pattern, i.e., they gave rise to elevated frequencies of IFN- production and
                    reduced frequencies of IL-4 production. However, the kinetics of their
                    precursor.frequencies were quite different in comparison with congenitally
                    resistant mice, thus suggesting different mechanisms for the establishment of
                    protective immunity.</p>
                <p>The data indicate that resistance to disease is correlated with fhe presence of

                    antigen-induced in vitro T cells responses were examined in 70 adult Gabonese. À
                    total extract of P.falciparum schizonts was used to represent the interactions
                    that might occur in vivo. À substantial majority of individuals showed antigen
                    specific T cell proliferative responses as well as significant production of
                    IL-2 and IFN-Y . There was however, a marked individual variation in all
                    responses examined. Furthermore, at the individual level, there was no
                    correlation between the proliferative response and IL-2 or IFN-Y production. 10%
                    of subjects were defined as low responders (LR., proliferative responses &lt; %
                    + 3 SD of control cultures). Kinetic studies showed that low responsiveness was
                    not due to altered response kinetics. Random examination of CD4 : CD8 T cell
                    ratios showed similar values for both high and low responders. Low
                    responsiveness was not totally overcome by the addition of rIL-2 but depletion
                    of CD8 T cells and addition of anti-HLA-DQ antibody augmented the responses or
                    LR but not high responders. In both groups the cell responsible for
                    proliferation IL-2 and IFN-Ÿ production was determined to be a CD4 T cell.
                    Depletion of CD8 T cells from LR cultures led to an increase in IFN-ÿ production
                    at the single cell level rather than increasing the numbers of IFN-Y producing
                    cells. Addition of autologus fresh CD8 T cell pre-cultured with schizont antigen
                    for 6 days significantly and specifically reduced the T cell responsiveness of
                    CD4 T cells from LR. The proportion of LR reported in this study is lower than
                    previously reported but this could reflect the definition of LR employed in the
                    current study. Clinically, low responsiveness to schizont antigens could be
                    beneficial to the host since hyper-responsiveness with concomittant over-
                    production of cytokines may be related to disease severity.</p>

                    phytohaemagglutinin. In 12 out of 15 patients suppression of CMI response was
                    suggested before treatment by nearly abrogated lymphocyte transformation index
                    (LTI) to leishmania antigen and negative leishmanin test. The impairment was.
                    corrected gradually along with sluggish clinical improvement. However, no such
                    specific impairment of CMI response was noticed in remaining 3 patients.
                    Satisfactory CMI response in these patients remained unaltered during and after
                    clinical improvement which was promptly attained with treatment. LTI to
                    phytohaemagglutinin in each of the 15 patients was normal. The observations made
                    seem to indicate that impairment of CMI response in PKDL is specific in nature
                    and satisfactory response does not always reflect a protection against the
                    disease.</p>

                    Protective immunity Normal mice acquire a strong immunity to reinfection with
                    eggs of Hymenolepis nana following a primary egg infection and hence they
                    completely reject cysticercoids from reinfection. However, neonatally
                    thymectomized mice, mice treated with antithymocyte serum or congenitally
                    athymic nude mice cannot acquire the strong immunity, and consequently, we can
                    easily find cysticercoids from reinfection in their intestinal villi.</p>
                <p>Up to now we indicated that the strong immunity was passively transferable to
                    recipient nude mice by intravenous injection of mesenteric lymph node cells
                    (MLNC) from immunized donor mice. In fact we could not find out any
                    cysticercoid. in these recipients even after primary infection. The capacity of
                    MLNC to passively transfer the strong immunity was abolished by pretreatment of
                    immune MLNC suspension with antiserum to Thy-1.2, i.e., MLNC devoid of T cells
                    failed to reject cysticercoïids when transferred to the recipients. Further
                    experiments in which MLNC suspension had been pretreatment with monoclonal
                    antibody to Lyt-2 resulted in complete rejection of cysticercoids. This shows
                    that Lyt- 1 positive cells devoid of subsets of phenotype Lyt-2.3 and Lyt-1.2.3
                    were éffectivé in the rejeetion. The more compelling evidence for the
                    participation of Lyt-1 positive cells came from recent study using monoclonal
                    antibody to L3T4 antigen. an of the adult thymectomized mice injected with this
                    antibody could not acquire the strons immunity and failed to reject the
                    evsticercoids derived from réirfection. These results suggest that L3T4 äs weil
                    as Lyt-1 positive cells h24 been involved in the develorment of the strong

                    using Glossina morsitans morsitans and observed for a period of 8 weeks. The
                    animals were examined for parasitaemia using the darkground method and
                    xenodiagnosis.</p>
                <p>The immune response was assessed using the serum neutralization test and the
                    indirect fluorescent antibody test (IFA). The cattle had high parasitaemias,
                    severe anaemia, and had to be treated to save them from dying. The waterbuck
                    however had low levels of parasitaemia for very short durations, had no
                    significant changes in PCV levels, and self- cured before the end of the
                    experimental period. Serological analysis showed that the waterbuck had a better
                    immunological response much earlier than the Boran cattle. It was concluded that
                    one of the mechanisms of trypanotolerance which the waterbuck deploy is the
                    ability to resist anaemia and control parasitaemia.</p>

                <p>Malaria- Hepatic phase - IL-I - IL-6.</p>
                <p>IL-1 was found to have an indirect inhibitory effect on in vitro malaria hepatic
                    stages. It is now clear that IL-6 and IL-1 share a large number of biological
                    activities, including induction of the acute phase response. The hypothesis that
                    IL-6 is a mediator of IL-1 activity on the malaria pre-erythrocytic stage was
                    evaluated using various types of hepatic cultures, including purified
                    hepatocytes or hepatocytes cocultured with non-parenchymal cells. Monoclonal
                    antibody directed IL-6 reduce the inhibitory effect of IL-1 on Plasmodium
                    penetration and maturation.</p>
                <p>Furthermore, deleterious effects of IL-6 on parasite development were

                <p>The survival of parasites in immoncompetent hosts has been explained by immune
                    evasion mechanisms. Sone of such mechanisms have been described in mamalian
                    hosts with cysticercosis, the larval infection of the cestode Taenia. We found
                    enzymatic activity of glutathion peroxidase (GPO) in extracts of T. solium and
                    T. crassiceps larvae. The enzyme was purified by affinity chromatography with
                    anti-GPO antibodies. T.</p>
                <p>crassiceps pure GPO kept its enzymatic activity and showed a molecular weight of
                    approximatily 100 Kd. GPO is an enzyme that inactivates toxic oxygen
                    intermediates like hydrogen peroxide, which are produced by host cells in
                    inflammatory reactions. If the parasite's GPO inactivates such radicals, it
                    might be one of the mechanisms used by cysticerci to reduce the host's
                    inflammatory reaction.</p>

                    Taenia multiceps material on accessory cell function of peritoneal macrophages
                    and transformational response of lymphocytes was studied. Peritoneal macrophages
                    from mice inoculated with Taenia multiceps cyst fluid (TMCF) and supernatant
                    from cultures of protoscoleces, were assayed for accessory cell function and Ia
                    antigen expression. Activated macrophages suppressed Con A- and TMF- driven
                    lymphocyte transformation. Primed lymphocytes were more sensitive, both to
                    positive and negative macrophage-derived signals. The number of Ia antigen
                    expressing cells in the suppressive macrophage population was significantly
                    reduced. Suppression of lymphocyte transformation was mediated by Ia-
                    macrophages. The factor(s) responsible for inducing the above change in
                    macrophage behaviour was confined: to a few FPLC fractions of TMCF and were also
                    antigenic. Another determinate fraction was mitogenic to naive lymphocyte,
                    especially to helper T cells. The mitogenic effect was macrophage dependent.
                    When inoculated subcutaneously with sheep erythrocytes (SREC), the mitogenic
                    fraction increased while suppressive fraction reduced the number of cells in the

                    among 4 CD4+ clones were found to significantly eliminate liver schizonts in a

                    transferring the cells in mice, 24 hours before challenging them with 2000
                    sporozoites of P. yoelü. A positive correlation was found between in vitro

                    particularly in relation to disease. Firstly, we report the case of 17 patients
                    in whom the level of T lymphocytes bearing the TcR Y/ô has been determined
                    during or after an episode of Plasmodium. falciparum attack. Among a group of 6
                    untreated patients, TcR 7Y/ô lymphocytes accounted for between 3% and 19% of the
                    CD3+ T lymphocytes (mean + 1 SD = 8.1 + 5.2), a percentage comparable to that in

                    the onset of crisis and the initiation of antimalarial therapy (which consisted
                    of slightly different regimens of quinin and mefloquin), the mean TcR Y/ô
                    lymphocyte level was'‘15.7 + 5.9 (range = 16.6 - 27.0), corresponding up to a

                <p>In Europe, only 17 cases of human babesiosis have so far been reported and most
                    of them were due to Babesia divergens. One consistent feature of severely ill
                    patients was a preexisting splenectomy. This, and the detection of antibodies to
                    Babesia in non-splenectomized individuals living in a potentially infected
                    environment and who have never shown signs of infection, is consistent with the
                    predominant role of phagocyte mediated protection against the parasite. This was
                    confirmed by experimental models in which the development of a significant
                    infection requires prior splenectomy. In this context, the role of T cells in
                    containing infection is presently unknown in both human and animal
                    babesiosis.</p>
                <p>We have studied the responses ‘to Babesia _antigens of lymphocytes from 3
                    splenectomized human patients who each suffered an episode of babesiosis
                    successfully cured 1 to 15 years previously. TE_ir T cells were able to
                    proliferate in vitro in response to Babesia extracts, whereas lymphocytes from
                    control non- sensitized donors did not respond under the same conditions.</p>
                <p>This suggests that in contrast with human T cell responses to the closely related
                    hematozoan Plasmodium falciparum (in which our data indicate that at the first
                    contact with the parasite, requirements are met for significant T-cell
                    stimulation), T lymphocyte responses to Babesia divergens soluble antigen
                    require antigen recognition and a previous contact of the host's immune system
                    with the parasite.</p>

                    reactivity during the acquisition of protection against malaria. For this
                    purpose, preleminary studies were undertaken to determine if both somatic and
                    excrete antigens from in vitro cultured P. falciparum are able to induce
                    specific proliferation of peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBL). Four groups were
                    constituted according to their malarial immune status : immune adults and
                    semi-immune children living in an endemic area, recently sensitized people and
                    European control subjects never exposed to malaria. Lymphocytes from
                    unsensitized persons responded neither to somatic nor to exoantigens, indicating
                    the absence of any non-specific mitogens in the preparation. In the other
                    groups, antigens induced a speci- fic lymphoproliferation, but the stimulation
                    index (SI) was of low intensity. Prevalence of positive responses are also low,
                    whatever the batch of antigens employed. The somatic antigens were fractionated
                    by isoelectrofocusing (IEF) technique to verify if this unres- ponsiveness would
                    not be the result of an antagonism due to a parasite-Gerived suppres- sor
                    factor. In spite of the low and dispersed response obtained with some IEF
                    fractions, our results confirmed the presence of memory T cells in previously

                    manifested a wave-like pattern with peaks of high activation on weeks 2, 4 and 7
                    post infection and periods of extremely Low phagocytosis on weeks 3 and 6 post
                    infection. Coating of the bacteria with antibodies resulted in a 4-fold increase
                    in the uptake. A similar increase was noted in uninfected cattle, indicating
                    that the infection modulated the basal phagocytic potential of the granulocytes
                    but did not infiuence their opsonising ability.</p>
                <p>No differences were observed in the phagocytic activity of granulocytes from
                    either tolerant or susceptible breeds. However, the number of circulating
                    granulocytes was much higher in N'Dama than Boran. It thus follows that N'Dama
                    were able to clear a higher number of particles per ml of blood.</p>

                    do not expel Nippostrongylus brasiliensis, as demonstrated by relatively
                    constant egg production over 27 days whereas in heterozygote littermates of the
                    nude rats, egg production by N. brasiliensis declines after day 8 post-infection
                    and ceases by day 12 post-infection. Heterozygote rats experience two periods of
                    weight loss during infection. The first occurs between days 2 and 5 post-
                    infection, corresponding to the period of larval migration, and the second, more
                    dramatic, period of weight loss occurs between days 7 and 11 post-infection,
                    corresponding to the time of worm expulsion. Nude rats do not experience
                    significant weight loss during infection. Heterozygote rats become slightly
                    anaemic during infection whereas nude rats do not and more than 90% of
                    heterozygote rats suffer diarrhoea compared to 27% of nude rats. These results
                    indicate that pathological manifestations of infection with N. brasiliensis may
                    be due to the vigorous response of the immune system. Because of the known role
                    of tumour necrosis factor (TNF) in causing weight loss, diarrhoea and
                    dyserythropoiesis, we attempted to measure TNF in the plasma of infected rats.
                    Results to date have been equivocal but treatment of rats with
                    lipopolysaccharide indicates that rats infected with N. brasiliensis are more
                    endotoxin- sensitive than uninfected rats, implying systemic production of
                    TNF.</p>

                    immunodepression Macrophages (MZ) from mice infected with S. mansoni exhibit a
                    reduction in hydrogen peroxide (H202) production, which may be modulated by
                    changes in levels of macrophage endogenous antioxidant enzymes. The objective of
                    these studies was to further analyze the effect of S. mansoni on macrophage
                    function in vitro and in vivo. Peritoneal macrophages from BCG elicited inbred
                    mice (C57BL/6) were cultured in the presence of either adult S. mansoni or
                    medium conditioned by incubation with adult worms.</p>
                <p>MS were subsequently stimulated with opsonized zymosan (0.5 mg/ml) to produce a
                    respiratory burst. A down-regulation of H202 release was observed which was
                    dose- dependent, in terms of either the number of adult worms present, or the
                    amount of conditioned medium added. Mÿ from mice with 3, 5 and 8 week infections

                <p>mansoni were compared with uninfected mice for their ability to produce tumour
                    necrosis factor (TNF-Q) when stimulated in vitro with lipopolysaccharide. No
                    significant difference between infected and uninfected mice was observed 3 weeks
                    post- infection, but TNF-Q levels were significantly lower in supernatants
                    collected from M9 from 5 and 8 week infected mice.</p>
                <p>These data indicate that depression of MZ function occurs as a result of murine
                    schistosome infections, but in addition can also be induced directly in vitro.
                    That schistosome infection depresses H202 and TNF-Q levels in vivo is not only
                    significant in terms of the state of M9 activation, but also may be indicative
                    of a relationship between levels of TNF and respiratory burst products.</p>

                    modulation-susceptible balance between parasite and its host, which also depends
                    on the genetic structure of its constituents, was established during evolution.
                    Disturbed balance is disadvantageous to either host or parasite but new balance
                    level may emerge under specific and strictly defined conditions and be
                    accompanied by interesting phenomena in the host immune response. Our investiga-
                    tion in the inbred BALBc and C57B1/6 mice has shown that immunomodulation caused
                    by thermal injury seven days prior to infection would lead to: the newly formed
                    host- parasite balance characterised by survival of the host which became
                    tolerant to extreme- ly high number of developed muscle larvae; the lowest T h/i
                    : T s/c cell ratio in both rodent strains favouring the absolute and relative
                    increase of T s/c cells; increased number of B cells detected in both strains;
                    immunosuppression of specific antibody syn- thesis and the amplification of
                    anti-heart muscle autoantibody synthesis in C57B1/6 strain only. Under these
                    experimental conditions BALBc and C57B1/6 mice exhibited dif- ferent

                    | Interleukin-1, Interferonÿ-, Leishmaniasis The response of mice to an
                    experimental infection with Leishmania major (L. major) is closely dependent on
                    the interplay of distinct CD4 T-helper-cell subsets. In BALB/c mice, which
                    develop a fatal disease, progression of symptoms is associated with the
                    preferential expansion of Th2 cells producing IL-4 and IL-5, but not IFN-y&lt;
                    Th2 cell have been shown to use IL-4 as autocrine growth factor, but only in the
                    presence of IL-1. To date, the importance of IL-1 for the expansion of Th2 cells
                    in leishmaniasis has not been studied extensively. Therefore, we compared the
                    ability for IL-1 production by splenic macrophages (M®) from BALB/c mice
                    chronically infected with L. major with that of non- infected animals. The
                    spleens of infected mice contained 4-5 fold more MŸ than those from control
                    animals. The relative amount of IL-1 detected in both cell lysates and
                    supernatants from Mh-cultures was significantly elevated in those from infected
                    mice.</p>
                <p>Similarly, IL-1 responses elicited by various L. major-antigens or by LPS were
                    also significantly higher in cultures from infected mice. Most of the generated
                    IL-1 was IL-1 . Antigen-induced CD4 T cells from infected mice responded to IL-1
                    with proliferation and IL-4 secretion significantly better than those from
                    non-infected animals. Both responses could be inhib'ted by IFN-ÿ; but not by
                    supernatants from activated, syngeneic T cells. In contrast, the IL-1 production
                    by L. major-stimulated Md-cultures from resistant C57BL/6 mice was significantly
                    masked ‘by minute amounts of CD4 T-cells or their supernatants. The active
                    principle proved to be IFN-y+ In conclusion, L. major-infection is a potent
                    stimulus for M to produce IL-k@. In susceptible BALB/c mice, together with IL-4,
                    it serves as an important factor for the expansion of deleterious Th2 cells,
                    with is not counterbalanced by IFN-Yy, as it is in resistant C;7BL/6 mice.</p>

                    suppression Trichinella spiralis is an obligate zoonotic intracellular nematode
                    parasite of vertebrates which stimulates an abundant specific immune response
                    with which the parasite co-exists. The mechanism by which T. spiralis escapes
                    the putatively protective effect of the immune response is a subject of
                    considerable interest; an understanding of this mechanism can clarify the fine
                    structure of the regulation of the interface between the host and the parasite.
                    Extracts of T. spiralis can be separated by Sephadex G-200 chromatography into
                    "antigen-poor" and "antigen-rich" fractions which can, respectively, enhance or
                    suppress infection by this parasite.</p>
                <p>Western blots of crude and purified fractions, probed with antisera from infected
                    or immunized animals, revealed more epitopes when reduced antigens were studied,
                    demonstrating that the immune system responds to more epitopes than those
                    present on the native molecule. Antigens were isolated by phase separation
                    and/or by electroelution to indicate the relationship of glycoproteins to an
                    enhancement of the infection ("immunosuppression") and that of proteins to
                    suppression ('"immuno- potentiation"). The survival of T. spiralis in its host
                    requires that the parasite diminish the effect of the normally protecting
                    responses of the host. The results of this study indicate that the immunology of
                    the host-parasite association in trichinellosis may be controlled entirely by
                    the parasite.</p>

                    T lymphocytes, i.e. CD45RA and CD4SRQ (UCHLI) which recognize different

                    "memory" T cells respectively. The comparison between lucalized cutaneous
                    leishmaniasis (LCL) and mucocutaneous leishmaniasis (MCL) lesions showed higher
                    values for the latter in relation to the number of CD4SRA positive cells and the
                    CD4/CD8 ratio. The highest value for fact cells was observed in LCL, whereas
                    CD4S5RO showed a peak value in DCL patients. HLA-DR+ cells were present in ail

                    purified schistosome antigen (9B antigen) were investigated. H-2 congenic mice
                    expressing both I-A and I-E antigens (I.E*) showed a higher in vitro
                    proliferation to 9B antigens as compared to the recombinant strains expressing
                    only I-A (I-E ). These two strains of mice differed both qualitatively and
                    quantitatively in the humoral responses elicited by the purified antigen.
                    Furthermore, in vivo protection experiments showed that mice which do not
                    express I-E molecules can be partially protected against the disease by prior
                    immunization with the 9B antigen in contrast to their I-E expressing

                    important in the resolution of malar ial infections. To study the role of T
                    cells in the protective immune response to the erythrocytic stages of the
                    parasite, we have utilised a murine model in which both antibody dependent and
                    independent mechanisms are considered important. Splenic T lymphocytes taken
                    from Plasmodium chabaudi chabaudi AS strain-infected NIH mice at four different
                    times following infection were established as cell lines in vitro using a lysed
                    extract of parasitised erythrocytes as the source of antigenic stimulation. By
                    using sur face immunofluorescence and the antibody-mediated complement lysis
                    assay, all four propagated lines have been phenotypically characterised as CD4*,
                    ie. belonging to the helper /inducer T cell subset. In vivo, adoptive transfer
                    of the cell lines was effective in conferr ing immune protection to naïve, to
                    lethally and to sublethally irradiated mice. This was manifested, compared to
                    controls receiving naive T cells and/or B cells, as both a reduced level of, and
                    a shorter duration of, primary patent parasitaemia, and as a more rapid final
                    clearance of parasites. For two of the cell lines the protective activity after
                    adoptive transfer into irradiated mice was significantly improved by the
                    cotransfer of additional naive B cells. It is concluded that two of the cell
                    lines act by antibody-rnediated mechanisms, whilst the reactivity of two others
                    may be B cell independent. The T cell lines are being assayed further for inter

                    response to this parasite. Neonatal thymectomy was carried out in BALB/c mice
                    within 72 h after birth following Sjodin's method (Transplantation 1:521,1963).
                    Six weeks later the animals were challenged with 10 small cysticerci
                    intraperitoneally, and after 30 days of infection the parasite load was
                    determined. We excluded from experimental groups all those animals with
                    histological evidence of thymic tissue. We found 1) a significant increase ïin
                    parasite load in thymectomized male and female mice over their controls; 2)
                    thymectomy makes males almost as susceptible as females to the infection.</p>

                    expression of mRNA specific for IL-4 in T cells. These responses were not
                    correlated in individual donors. However,in individual donors, expression of
                    IL-4 mRNA correlated with the occurrence of elevated concentrations of serum
                    antibodies for the peptide used for T-cell activation. These results suggest a
                    possible causal relationship between the activation of IL-4 producing cells and
                    antibody production.</p>
                <p>Due to the polymorphism of the outbred population tested, the MHC class II
                    restriction of T- and B-cell responses to different peptides was difficult to
                    demonstrate. However data with monozygotic twins clearly demonstrated a genetic
                    regulation of these responses. The structural and genetic conditions for these T
                    cell responses are under investigation.</p>

                    vivo injection of anti-CD4 antibody into Hp-infected BALB/c mice resulted in an
                    increase in worm fecundity (expressed as eggs produced per female worm) and a
                    suppression of the protective response to worms derived from a challenge
                    infection; the polyclonal IgE and IgG, responses to infection were also blocked
                    by anti-CD4.</p>
                <p>Anti-CD8 antibody treatment of Hp-infected mice did not affect immunity nor did
                    it alter the polyclonal IgE or IgGl response to infection. Therefore, the role
                    of cat T cell-derived lymphokines in these host responses to infection was
                    evaluated.</p>
                <p>Groups of mice were inoculated with Hp and injected concurrently with either
                    control antibody or anti-IL-4 or anti-interleukin 5 (IL-5) or both
                    anti-lymphokine antibodies at weekly intervals. Mice were subsequently
                    drug-treated to remove adult worms and challenge-infected with Hp along with
                    continued injections of antibody. Mice treated with anti-IL-5 had a suppressed
                    eosinophilia but a typical polyclonal IgE and IgG.</p>
                <p>response to infection. Protective immunity in these mice was unaffected: worm
                    fecundity and adult worm recovery from the Hp-challenged mice were similar in
                    control antibody and anti-IL-5 treated mice, and markedly reduced as compared to
                    naive mice given a primary Hp inoculation. In contrast, worm fecundity and adult
                    worm recovery in Hp-challenged, anti-IL-4 treated mice were similar to the
                    levels observed in naive mice given a primary Hp inoculation; anti-IL-4 did
                    suppress the polyclonal IgE, but not the IgG: response to Hp. These results
                    clearly demonstrate a role for IL-4 in protective immunity to Hp and suggest
                    that IL-5 does not contribute to this protection.</p>

                    determinants This study was aimed at developing a method to investigate which
                    surface determinants of schistosome larvae do, and which ones do not evoke
                    defence activities in snail haemocytes. Subjects of the study were the avian
                    schistosome Trichobilharzia ocellata and the vond snail Lymnaea stagnalis
                    (compatible combination), and Schistosoma mansoni- L. stagnalis (incompatible
                    combination). Miracidia of both schistosome species were transformed to mother
                    sporocysts in vitro. Several methods were applied to harvest sporocyst surface
                    determinants: freezing-thawing, SDS- and Triton-solubilization. An assay was
                    developed for testing the responsiveness of snail haemocytes to the different
                    surface determinants of the sporocysts. First, the determinants were separated
                    with PAGE or agarose electronhoresis. Then, the gels were covered with a type of
                    agarose for which the haemocytes show no aviditv. Snail haemocytes were allowed
                    to react with the electrophoresis profile; differential binding to the different
                    surface determinants of the compatible and of the incompatible sporocysts was
                    quantitatively determined with a light microscope. The method can probably be
                    used to study the avidity of binding of host defence cells to parasitic antigens

                <p>Cattle, infected with a stock of Trypanosoma vivax which produced the acute
                    haemorrhagic disease, were examined for the existence of antibodies to

                    demonstrated antibody titres to normal erythrocytes and platelets in the plasma
                    of infected animals. The antibodies were detectable following the first peak of
                    parasitaemia (10 - 15 days Pie), and antibody activity was maximal 30 - 35 days
                    p.i. Plasma from cattle, taken after 32 days p.i., precipitated radio-labelled
                    proteins from autologous platelets and, less efficiently, from autologous
                    erythrocytes. Fluorescence activated cell sorter (FACS) assays demonstrated that
                    erythrocytes and platelets from infected cattle bound 18M and 1gG in vivo, and
                    that both normal blood cell types could absorb these antibodies following
                    incubation in plasma from infected animals. Complememnt (C3) was similarly

                    amyloid deposition, were shown to be dependant on an alveolar hydatid cyst (AHC)
                    surface antigen. The increase in LCM, spleen weight and splenic amyloid was
                    inversely proportional to the number of cyst washings during the preparation of
                    the inoculum. The minimum number of washings found to induce significant
                    reduction in parasite growth in the host and amyloid deposition was between 4
                    and 8 washings. After twenty four washings the parasite was unable to carry a
                    progressive type of infection, under these conditions the restrictive phase was
                    extended to 8 weeks. This finding was further confirmed by surgical
                    transplantation of cysts obtained, from infected mice at 12 weeks post-
                    infection, to normal mice. The amount of splenic amyloid deposits, LCM and
                    spleen weight after one week post-transplant was statistically not different
                    from those in mice infected according to standard procedure after 12 weeks post
                    infection The restrictive phase was completely eliminated following cyst
                    transplantation. Comparative analysis between antigens before and after Cyst
                    washing on SDS-PAGE indicated that the molecular weight of the putative surface
                    antigen is in the range of 43,950 daltons.</p>

                <p>The cellular infiltrate in the rat cornea was analysed and compared with that
                    reported in humans. The Acanthamoeba used had been isolated from a brain
                    abscess. Inocula of 104 amoebae (92% trophozoites) and 108 Viable
                    Corynebacterium xerosis were injected into the corneal stroma of Porton rats.
                    These induced suppurative keratitis and on the seventh day following injection
                    the animals were killed and the corneas excised and divided. Gram and giemsa
                    staining of JB-4 plastic embedded sections revealed trophozoites migrant
                    throughout the stroma and a dense infiltrate of neutrophils. No bacteria were
                    seen. Other specimens were embedded in O.C.T. compound and cryostat sections
                    were prepared. The sections were treated with a range of monoclonal anti-rat
                    leucocyte antibodies and developed using the avidin-biotin-peroxidase method. In

                <p>Nippostrongylus brasiliensis Platelet Activating Factor.</p>
                <p>Platelet Activating Factor (PAF) is a potent immune modulator known to be a
                    central mediator in inflammation. We have shown that i) Incubation of PAF with
                    secreted products of immeture (L4) worms causes loss of activity, as measured by
                    platelet aggregation ii) This loss of activity is concentration and time
                    dependent and is therefore consistent with enzymatic catabolism of PAF. It is
                    possible that this activity may serve to inhibit or delay expulsion of worms
                    from the Gestro- intestinal tract. Preliminary studies using enzyme inhibitors
                    suggest that the catabolic activity observed may be consistent with that
                    previously described as "Acetylcholinesterase”. We are further studying this
                    phenomenon using affinity pur ified enzyme and are in the process of cloning

                <p>H. diminuta, CRP, Immune damage Hymenolepis diminuta provides a good model for
                    the study of mucosal immune responses to adult cestodes. Few studies, however,
                    have been made on its natural host, the rat, and there is little evidence to
                    date on the mechanisms of immune expulsion.</p>
                <p>Our investigations have considered the role of the acute phase protein,
                    C-reactive protein (CRP), both as an indicator of an inflammatory response in
                    vivo and as a possible effector of complement mediated lysis of the parasite in
                    vitro. An in vitro assay was developed in which worms were incubated (37°C; 5%
                    CO.) in either 50% normal or heat-inactivated (56°C; 30 mins) rat serum in the
                    presence or absence of CRP for up to 24 h. Within 2-3 h a dose dependent CRP
                    specific mediated damage was observed with parasites showing a reduced motility
                    and regions of opaque tissue over the entire length. An initial study of
                    concentrations of CRP isolated from serum by affinity chromatography using
                    ortho-phosphorylethanolamine indicated an increase days post-infection (p.i.).
                    This was confirmed using a sandwich ELISA and extended to show a peak elevation
                    at 7 days p.i. followed by a suppression at day 15 with a return to control
                    levels by day 35.</p>

                    The characterisation of an HSP 90 like gene of Plasmodium falciparum has been
                    recently reported.</p>
                <p>Autoimmune reactivity in malaria patients has been described against different
                    host components such as red blood cells, lymphocytes, thyroid, heart, gastric
                    parietal cells and single stranded DNA. We have investigated the presence of
                    antibodies reacting with pure human HSP 90 using a pannel of human sera
                    collected from Brazilian malaria patients. Significant levels of antibodies were
                    observed during the acute phase of the disease. The antibody titer decreases in
                    patients that suffered several malaria infections.</p>

                    2109/CARACAS CIC C1q HYDATIC DISEASE Due to the difficulty to find direct
                    parasitologic evidence of hyda- tic infection before surgery, the diagnosis
                    usually requires the demons - tration of specific serum antibodies. However the
                    percentage of "serone - gative" cases with the ELISA test may be quite high. In
                    such "seronegati- ve" cases circulant antigen and/or immunocomplexes have often
                    been demons trated. Several reports have also suggested that CIC may be usefull
                    in the follow-up of patients submitted for treatment.</p>
                <p>Preliminar studies have also shown the presence of CIC in uruguayan and
                    venezuelan patients with the C1q ELISA test. The optical density values were
                    significantly rised in 10 out of 12 patients and were higher in disseminated
                    than in localized disease. In one patient increasing con- centration of
                    antibodies and CIC were observed after rupture of hepatic cyst. This patient han
                    negative delayed skin reaction to hydatid antigen with preserved cellular
                    response to PHA and mixed lymphocyte culture. The search for specific CIC and
                    the possible relationship between CIC and al- terations of cellular immunity
                    deserves further study.</p>

                <p>À group of 208 individuals negative in skin tests to PFD and leishmanin (7 £mm )
                    from an endemic area for leishmaniasis in Venezuela, were randomized into four
                    groups and immunized 3 times at intervals of 8 weeks with the foilowing: BCG +
                    killed promastigotes of L.mexicana amazonensis (group #:68 individuals), BCS
                    alone {group B:47), Hkilled promastigotes alone (group C:47) and placebo (group
                    D:46).</p>
                <p>After the third dose of vaccine there was à significant (P£0.05) double
                    conversion to positive (2 10mm} for both FFD and leishmanin in group À ( 38.94 )
                    when compared to the other groups {H: 2.94%; Cs 3.55% and D:2.54).</p>
                <p>In addition 8 weeks after each dose of vaccine, INF-Y was measured by ELISA in
                    su- gernatants from cells stimulated with Leishmania and PPD antigens. In the
                    PPD stimu- lated supernatants we found significantly (P&lt;0.01} higher levels
                    of INF-Yin group À comparec to groups E and D at 8 weeks (after the first dose),
                    and in groups € and D at 16 weeks (after the second dose). There were high
                    levels of INF-Y in group à after the third dose but no significant differences
                    between the groups were found .</p>
                <p>Concerning Leishmania antigen- stimulated supernatants, after the third
                    vaccination {24 weeks) the level of INF-Win group À was significantly higher
                    (P&lt; 0.05) when com- pared to groups BE and D. Our results suggest that the
                    combination cf BCG + Leish- mania promastigotes was the most effective in
                    inducing immunological changes in healthy individuals and should be considered
                    in future for immunoprophylaxis programs against leishmaniasis.</p>

                <p>The toxicity of hydatid cyst fluid (HCF) of Echinococcus granulosus has been well
                    do- cumented by different authors. We studied the toxic effect of HCF, at
                    different times of interaction and concentrations, on several established cell
                    lines such as HeLa, Vero McCoy, macrophages P-388D1, and macrophages J-774A.1
                    cells as well as non-stimulated murine peritoneal macrophages (strain NMRI),
                    (MOP). We used dilutions (100, 75, 50, 25, 10 y 1 %) of HCF from cysts derived
                    from sheep. Cell cultures were maintained in RPMI- 1640 suplemented with 10 %
                    inactivated foetal bovine serum, at 37 C in a humidified at- mosphere with 5 %
                    of CO2. Incubation was carried out with dilutions of HCF containing 10 uCi/ml
                    of: (H3)Leucine, (H3)Thymidine, (H3)Uridine or (S35)Methionine and the times
                    were 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 hours. The incorporation of these labelled precursors was
                    measu- red by liquid scintillation method. Results were evaluated as inhibition
                    incorporation percentages of the different radioactive precursors (% I.I.). We
                    observed a significant toxic effect on cell lines tested wich manifested itself
                    at the end of the first hour of incubation. However, MOP were more sensitive to
                    HCF than the other cell lines. We also noticed that the toxic effect tended to
                    stabilize itself between 3-5 hours of in- cubation.</p>

                <p>We demonstrated that the therapeutic efficiency of immunotherapy (BCG plus killed
                    promastigotes of Leishmania mexicana) is equal to that of chemotherapy
                    (Glucantime), without causing the serious side-effects of the drug
                    treatment.</p>
                <p>Furthermore, we evaluated various aspects of cell mediated immunity in 39
                    Ilocalized cutaneous leishmaniasis patients who received im- munotherapy (IT)
                    and 34 submitted to chemotherapy (CT). We demonstra- ted evident signs of T-cell
                    activation in cured patients who had received either CT or IT. A significantly
                    increased expression of IL-2 receptors was observed in such patients, compared
                    to their pretreatment values. Aiso,significant percentages of patients both for
                    IT and CT showed augmented lymphoproliferative antigenic responses in _vitro
                    (IT: 42%; CT:33%) and cutaneous reactivity to leishmanial antigen (IT: 45%; CT:
                    31%). No evidence was found for the development of an exaggerated immune
                    response to Leishmania parasites in the IT group. We will discuss our results in
                    terms of a national program for immunotherapy of leishmaniasis in Venezuela,

                    cost and the fact that it does not induce a state of hyper-reactivity.</p>

                <p>TNF and mouse cerebral malaria The cerebral pathology observed in Plasmodium
                    berghei ANKA:-infected CBA mice has been attributed to overproduction of TNF,
                    the mice in which this syndrome is seen being those with the highest serum TNF
                    levels. To investigate this further, we injected recombinant human TNF into
                    malaria-primed mice to see if we could reproduce the cerebral changes observed
                    in P. berghei ANKA infections. À range of doses, administered as a single or
                    repeated injections, or via osmotic pumps, failed to reproduce these changes,
                    but did induce hypoglycaemia, mid-zonal liver necrosis and neutrophil adhesion
                    in pulmonary vessels. This pathology is seen in terminal Plasmodium vinckei
                    infections, but is absent in terminal P. berghei ANKA. In addition, the
                    permeability of the blood brain barrier to Evan's blue, which is present in P.
                    berghei ANKA (but not in normal or P. vinckei-infected mice), was not induced by
                    exogenous TNF. Serum levels of TNF were measured on an ELISA assay, and found to
                    be consistently higher in P. vinckei rather than P. berghei ANKA terminal
                    infections. This is consistent with the pathological changes we could reproduce
                    by injecting TNF being normally present in terminal P. vinckei infections, but
                    not in mice with cerebral malaria due to P. berghei ANKA. For these reasons we
                    suggest that the cerebral pathology seen in mice infected with P. berghei ANKA
                    may be governed by TNF produced locally by monocytes sequestered within the
                    cerebral blood vessels, not simply by systemic levels of this cytokine.</p>

                    occurs predominantly in the lungs, and involves a cell-mediated immune response.
                    After vaccination, large numbers of macrophages and lymphocytes infiltrate the
                    lungs, persisting at elevated levels for at least 10 weeks. We wished to
                    determine whether attenuated larvae reaching the lungs provided the stimulus for
                    leucocyte infiltration, and also to assess the contribution of these cells to
                    the ensuing level of resistance. À parabiotic union was made between mice
                    shortly after vaccination of one partner; they were separated 28 days later and
                    subsequently challenged. This procedure results in transfer of 70% of the
                    resistance of the vaccinated animal to it’s naive twin. At day 21, when peak
                    cell numbers occur in the lungs of the vaccinated partner, there was no
                    detectable cell infiltrate in the lungs of the naive partner and no vaccinating
                    parasites were found. The blastogenic response of spleen cells to parasite
                    antigens was identical in vaccinated and naive mice at this time. After
                    challenge, the numbers of leucocytes recovered from the Ilungs of the separated
                    mice were similar, although the composition differed markedly; macrophages were
                    the abundant cell type in vaccinated animals, whilst polymorphs predominated in
                    the naive partners.</p>
                <p>There were also fewer inflammatory foci, of smaller dimensions, in the lungs of
                    the latter. We therefore suggest that prior “arming" of the lungs results in a
                    more intense and effective inflammatory response than if cells are recruited
                    after the arrival of challenge parasites.</p>

                    this work was to further characterize this reaction using monoclonal antibodies
                    raised against various pig's cell phenotypes and against antigen B. Tissue
                    sections of cisticerci obtained from 12 different pigs were analyzed. In
                    contrast to that observed in other granulomas, T. lymphocytes were rarely found
                    around T. solium cysticercus. B cells were present in large numbers in most
                    cases. (Cells bearing class II molecules were also frequently observed,
                    particularly those with the DQ phenotype. Antigen B was abundant within the
                    bladder wall and it was also demonstrated in the inflammatory reaction
                    suggesting it contributes to its development.</p>

                    Res., Mill Hill, London (MH) and the U.S. Naval Med. Res. Inst. (NMRI) in
                    studies with gamma-irradiated cercaria-immunized mice. In an attempt to confirm
                    recent MH data indicating that parasite strain differences are responsible, we
                    immunized C57BL/6 mice with the MH and NMRI strains, challenged them
                    percutaneously (pc) with the homologous strain of ?°Se-labeled cercariae, and
                    determined the numbers of parasites in the skin, lungs and liver by
                    autoradiography of tissue squashes 2,4,5,6,7,8,10 and 14 days later. The two
                    strains produced similar results (MH and NMRI data respectively): (1)
                    Accumulation in the lungs peaked on day 7 in control mice (96% and 92% of skin
                    penetrants) but was delayed until day 10 in immunized mice (82% and 62%). (2)
                    The total numbers of larvae detected on day 14 in immunized mice (74% and 79% of
                    penetrants) were not reduced relative to controls.</p>
                <p>Adult worm recoveries of immunized mice (day 42) were reduced relative to
                    controls (60% and 68%). In a second experiment, resistance was compared in
                    immunized mice challenged pc with cercariae and intravenously (iv) with
                    7-day-old lung schistosomula derived from the same cercarial pool. Adult worm
                    recoveries were reduced in both groups - 69% (pc) and 52% (iv). We conclude that
                    most or all immune elimination observed in this study occurred during the lung
                    phase of migration for both strains, and that differences between laboratories
                    may involve differences in combinations of mouse and parasite strains or other
                    unrecognized factors, but not simply differences in parasite strain, mouse
                    strain or technique. (Supported by U.S. Naval Medical Research and Development

                    assayed for their ability to induce granulomas when coupled to sepharose beads
                    that were subsequently embolized in lungs of jirds with infections of 60 or 150

                    lymphnode (EN) and spleen cells from jirds with similar infections. Granulomas
                    induced by un- fractionated B. pahangi antigen and eluate from the lentile
                    lectin column produced simi- lar reactions which were maximal at 60 DPI and
                    significantly reduced at 150 DPI. Three fractions (B,C,D) of flowthrough from
                    the lentil lectin column induced little or no reaction at either time. Reaction
                    to one fraction (E) was significantly any other fraction at 60 DPI. The
                    remaining fractions (F,G) were similar in granulomatous reac- tivity to starting
                    fractions. Fraction coated bead induced granuloma formation corre- lated with
                    the intensity of pulmonary perivascular eosinophil infiltrate. Blastogenic
                    responses of LN cells and splenocytes to crude Ag were similar to previous

                <p>Splenocyte reactivity corresponded to granulomatous reactivity to crude Ag.
                    Fractions B, C, and D appear to be suppressive in cell cultures at all
                    concentrations tested. Corre- lations of in vivo granulomatous reactivity and in
                    vitro blastogenic responses were not demonstrable with other fractions. These
                    studies indicate that in vivo pulmonary granu- loma formation is useful in
                    identification of parasite proteins potentially important in the induction of

                    visceral syndromes In previous studies it was observed that the immunological
                    response to migrating larvae of Toxocara canis in human beings belonged to both
                    IgG and IgE antibodies. In such studies the presence of IgE antibodies, detected
                    by a radio allergo sorbent test (RAST) with ex- cretory secretory (ES) second
                    stage larvae antigens, seemed to be more reliable for the diagnosis of ocular
                    syndrome (OLM). However, in sera with very high IigG values against T. canis
                    (mainly in visceral syndromes VLM), a competitive inhibition between IgG and IgE
                    was observed using solid phase systems, such as ELISA and RAST, that was able to
                    mask the presence of IgE making in a few cases the IgE test negative. In
                    electrophoretic anal- ysis (such as crossed radio immunoelectrophoresis CRIE),
                    the antigen surplus makes the competition ineffective.</p>
                <p>18 sera from OLM patients and 12 from VLM patients, both positive for larva
                    specific IgG and IgE were studied by CRIE. Antigen analysis by crossed
                    immunoelectrophoresis (CIE) showed the presence of six different antigens in ES
                    products from second stage larvae, two of which migrate towards the cathode and
                    four migrate towards the anode. All the antigens were recognized by IgG and IgE
                    from LM sera. However, specific IgG from VLM sera tended to recognize both
                    cathodic and anodic antigens while specific IgG from OLM sera tended to
                    recognize cathodic antigens mainly. No difference in IgE patterns, either in
                    sera from VLM or OLM, were seen.</p>

                <p>Anaplasosis is an arthropod-borne heaoparasitic disease of cattle and wild
                    rusinants caused by the rickettsia Anaplasea sarginale. Anaplasaosis occurs in
                    the tropical and subtropical regions of the world. Identification and
                    characterization of parasite antigens or parasite-dependent antigenic changes in
                    host coaponents is an essential step in understanding #hich of the aany
                    antigenic coaponents in parasite or infected cells sight be iaportant
                    iseunologically. By iaaune electron sicrosopy we studied the structural
                    localization of antibody reaction on the parasite and on red blood cell
                    surfaces, This technique revealed that the husoral iaaune respose is stiaulated
                    by antigens localized on the cell wall, the surface aesbrane and in the
                    cytoplasa of the parasite and by autoantigens localized on the red blood cell
                    aesbrane.</p>
                <p>He also studied the kinetic of the iaaune response to antigens of the parasite
                    and to autoantigens of the erythrocyte by setabolic labelling of parasite
                    proteins with 386-Het, and using westernblot techniques with polyclonal
                    antibodies. We found an early response to four parasite polypeptides with Mr
                    within the range of 16-20, 35-40, 80-85 and 86-90. These antigens had been
                    recognized by sera collected fros aniaals with prepatent (&lt;1%) to post-peak
                    (carrier stage &lt;{4)) parasiteaia, An increasing nusber of antigens say be
                    identified as the parasiteaia increases, sostly by sera collected after the peak
                    of parasiteaia. Coaparing the fluorography of S$6-Het labelled parasite proteins
                    with westernblots of purified anaplasea and noraal red blood cell aesbranes, we
                    found that an autoiasmune response begins to be elicited around the peak of
                    parasiteaia and as aanyÿ as seven polypeptides with MWr of 264, 189, 98, 77, 66,
                    28 and 20 Kd can be identified. Parasite antigens identified in this report say
                    be relevant to the design for serodiagnostic aethods and to isaunoprofilaxis.
                    Autoantigens aay be expressed by different sechanisas: aodification of host
                    cosponents, attachaent of extracellular Ag to the surface of the red blood cells
                    as soluble antigens or antibodÿ-antigen complexes and exposure of host cell
                    coaponents. No experisental evidence is available regarding the sechanise of
                    autoiaaune response, but it is probably responsible for heaolytic anemia which
                    is characteristic of bovine anaplasaosis.</p>

                    Trypanosoma cruzi - neuromyopathy - immunopathology We have reported

                    with a myotropic T.cruzi strain, CA-I. It is compared here with RA (reticulotro-

                    T.cruzi antigens (Ag), IgG, IgM or C3 deposits, at 154, 4m, 9mpi. EMG study
                    showed more evident neuromuscular involvement in CA-I. Hamstring muscle (HM)
                    infiltrates (Inf) increased steadily in this strain while they peaked at 4mpi in
                    RA. Cell count in 30 fields (400x) were lower in CA-I vs RA at 15dpi
                    (Mac-1:68+9vs152+16; L3TA4:38+10vs160+18; Lyt2:33+2vs165 +27;p&lt;.01); at Ampi
                    L3TA predominated in CA-I (684+73vs393+42,p&lt;.01) and Lyt2 in RA
                    (427+29vs815+33,p&lt;.01); at 9mpi Inf were greater in CA-I
                    (Mac-1:465+136vs85+32; LATA: 1051+324vs81+46; Lyt2:1471+575vs222+95; p &lt;.01).
                    At this time fibrosis was intense in CA-I. Ag was only seen as amastigotes in
                    both strains. In sciatic nerve (ScN) Inf count was lower at 15dpi in CA-T
                    (Mac-1:22+2vs105+7; LSTA:26+2vs112+5; Lyt2:13+2vs117+3; p&lt;.01), peaked at
                    4mpi in both strains (Mac-1:103+38vs235+42,p&lt;.05; Lyt2:116+31vs264+54,
                    p&lt;.01) and dropped at 9mpi (Mac-1:42+8vs26+5 and Lyt2:20+8vs81+36,p&lt;.05).
                    Axonal degene- ration was more evident äin RA vs CA-I at 4 and 9mpi. Parasites
                    were absent in ScN and spinal cord. Inf ïin the latter, located in meninges,
                    were similar to those in ScN. In CA-I alone, LB with surface IgM were seen at
                    9mpi in all 3 tissues and inter- stitial IgG at Ampi in HM. Results suggest

                    Trypanosoma cruzi, Autoimmunity, Monoclonal Antibodies Autoimmunity is a well
                    known feature of Chagas'’disease. Several antibodies reacting with T.cruzi and
                    host cell antigenic determinants have been reported during T.cruzi infections.
                    To further explore this issue, we have obtained monoclonal antibodies (MAB) from
                    T.cruzi-infected mice. Several of those monoclonals reacted with host tissues as
                    well as with the parasite. One of those MAB, C10, recognize an antigen of 50 kD
                    specifically present in T.cruzi, but not in other Trypanosomatidee, membranes.
                    When this MAB was tested by cytofluorometry against a panel of mammalian cell
                    lines, it was found to react with mouse plasmacytoma cell lines. MAB C10 did not
                    stain several other human and mouse hematopoeitie cell lines tested.</p>
                <p>Futhermore, it reacted with the membrane of activated but not resting B
                    lymphocytes cells. B cell activators as LPS and phorbol esters induced the
                    appearance of this antigen 48 hrs after activation. By double colour
                    cytoflourometry, 96 hrs after activation with LPS most of the activated B cells
                    (&gt;90%) were stained with MAB C10. Experiments are in progress to characterize
                    biochemichally this antigen on B cells. Our results indicate that a
                    T.cruzi-specific MAB crossreacts with cells of the immune system and this may
                    have profound implications in the understanding of the complex immune
                    disfunctions associated with Chagas'disease.</p>

                <p>Sex, cysticercosis, susceptibility.</p>
                <p>Female Balb/c mice are more susceptible than males to infection with Taenia
                    crassiceps metacestodes. Gonadectomy tends to minimize sex associated
                    differences in susceptibility, reducing two times the parasite load in females
                    and increasing three times the parasite load in males. Addition of estrogen,
                    testosterone and progesterone to cysticerci maintained in vitro has no effect on
                    parasite growth and reproduction, Depression of immune system by irradiation
                    cancels the gonadectomy effects. Therefore the effect of gonads in
                    susceptibility appears to be mediated by the immune system and not directly by
                    action of sex hormones on parasite growth. Sublethal irradiation increases
                    parasite load in intact males but not in intact females, while in gonadectomized
                    animals only female susceptibility was increased. These studies suggest that
                    ovaric factors depress effective immune events against cysticerci while
                    testicular factors enhance it.</p>

                <p>Anongst the possibilities under consideration for the percieved differences
                    between the two communities are the levels of immunity to infection and the
                    individuals ability to modulate reactions to egg antigens. In vitro correlates
                    of immunity have been investi- gated by examining patients' lymphoproliferative
                    responses (incorporation of tritiated thymidine) to soluble worm antigens (SWA),
                    and to the cloned antigens glutathione-s- transferase (P28) and Triose Phosphate
                    Isomerase (TPI). Similarly, correlates of patho- logy have been examined by
                    lymphocyte responses to Egg antigens (SEA) and by assay of T cells with epitopes
                    for anti-idiotypes to SEA (IDT). Initially 30 patients of high morbidity were
                    recuited from KIBWEZI. All were high responders to SWA, 13 responded strongly to
                    P28, 17 to SEA, 12 to IDT, and 2/4 to TPI. A comparative study of age, sex and
                    eggload matched patients from KIBWEZI and MIU (12/group) has so far not yielded

                <p>Passive transfer of immune serum from donors vaccinated with irradiated cercariae
                    injected during the lung stage of parasite migration conferred partial
                    protection on both athymic (Nu/Nu) and heterozygous (Nu/+) rats against
                    cercarial challenge. As early as day 8 post-infection (p.i.) 59% fewer
                    schistosomula were present in the portal system of athymic recipient rats of
                    vaccine serum as compared with recipients of normal serum, and similar levels of
                    resistance were present when animals were examined up to 21 days p.i. In the
                    heterozygotes also there was evidence of maximal levels of resistance being
                    expressed by day 8 p.i. Results of quantitative histology of lungs from these
                    animals were consistent with the perfusion data. Maximal percentage trapping of
                    lung stage parasites in lung granulomas occurred at day 8 in both nude and
                    heterozygote rats receiving immune serum, and were 3 times the percentage of
                    somules trapped in recipients of normal serum. These results support the theory
                    that immunity acts at the lung stage in rats and are compared and contrasted
                    with parallel experiments in actively-immunized T-cell depleted mice.</p>

                <p>The striking association between eosinophilia and Schistosoma mansoni infection
                    was stressed by the literature.However, because little is known about the others
                    cellular li- neages, we studied the general haematopoietic response in the bone
                    marrow and other tissues during murine schistosomiasis.Infected outbred albino
                    Swiss mice were analised from 15 to 160 days of infection (6 animalsÆvery five
                    days). The results were the following: 1-The percentage of medullary eosinophils
                    varied from 4.0 to 80% (70th day of infection); 2-Le- vels of eosinophils in the
                    bone marrow and blood showed synchronization only around 50%; 3-Neutrophils
                    predominate in the bone marrow except at 70th day of infection, when they were
                    surpassed by the eosinophils; the lowest levels of neutrophils coincided with
                    the highest levels of imature eosinophils (from 50 to 90 days after infection);
                    4-Lymphocytic lineage was more or less constant and only increase from 90 to 160
                    day infection; Plasma cells only appeared 90 days on after infection;
                    5-Erythroid and megakaryocytic lineages showed little variation; 6-Eosinopoiese
                    in the spleen of infected animals was significan- tly higher than in control
                    group; 7-Hepatic and lymph node eosinophilic metaplasia began at day 40 and
                    coincided with eosinopoiesis in the bone marrow; 8-Hepatic neutrophilic me-
                    taplasia began at day 50 and was inverse to medullary neutropoiesis. The present
                    observa- tions point to the following conclusions: 1-Murine S. mansoni infection
                    present three dis tinct haematopoietic phases: a)Non or low-productive phase
                    (before 35-40 days of infec- tion); b)Acute productive phase (from 35-40 to
                    70-90 days) and c)Chronic productive phase (after 70-90 days of infection);
                    2-The acute productive phase is characterized by an in- crease in the number of
                    eosinophils and monocyte/macrophages and a decrease in the numbers of
                    neutrophils; 3-The C precursor cell (myeloid committed cell) appears to be the
                    princi- pal target of CSFs (GM-CSF, IL-5...). (Supported by CNPq and FINEP).</p>

                <p>Adult worms of Schistosoma mansoni live in the mesenteric venous system, where
                    they secre te or release highly antigenic and toxic materials. Mesenteric and
                    portal venous systems are the interface between parasite agressions and host
                    responses. For this reason we stu- died the kinetic of the peritoneal cellular
                    response and the concomitant milky spot in- volvement during murine
                    schistosomiasis. Five days old mice (102 albino Swiss) infected percutaneously
                    with 70 cercariae were analised from 15 to 160 days of infection. The re- sults
                    were the following: 1-Significant inèrease in the number of eosinophilic
                    granulocy- tes which presented a cyclic or scalonated ascending pattern. The
                    percentage of eosino- phils varied from 0.08 to 16%; 2-Mast cells exhibited a
                    cyclic pattern and an inverse or direct relationship with the eosinophilic
                    numbers depending on the time of infection (0.05-0.58%); 3-There was one inverse
                    relationship between the decrease of mesothelial cells and the increase of
                    lymphoblastoid mononuclear cells; 4-The number of resident peri toneal
                    macrophages remained essentially unaltered; 5-The presence of mature lymphocytes
                    end neutrophils also exhibit a cyclic pattern, the former presented the largest
                    peak at 60th day and the later at 50th day of infection; 6-Plasma cells were not
                    detected; 7-Mil- ky spots were very active during all the time of infection and
                    from 45th day on they ex- hibited an "Bone marrow-like transformation"
                    characterized by intense eosinophilic meta- plasie, lymphocytosis with
                    immunoblastoid and plasma cells (local plasmocytosis), presen- ce of Russel
                    bodies, monocytes/macrophages, neutrophils and mesothelial cells. The hysto-
                    pathological analysis of the milky spots showed that the rise of the number of
                    peritoneal cells can be explained partially by the intense reactivity of the
                    milky spots, with local production and release of cells to peritoneal
                    fluid.(Supported by CNPq and FINEP).</p>

                <p>A synthetic peptide (R-13) comprising the 13-carboxyl terminal residues of the
                    JLS recombinant protein (Trypanosoma cruzi P ribosomal protein) was used to
                    study by ELISA the humoral R-13 antibody response of chagasic patients.
                    Simultaneously, the reactivity against total T. cruzi extract was measured.
                    Results show that 62% of the 53 chagasic sera were positive for R-13. The
                    anti-R-13 as well as the anti-T. cruzi response was mainly of the IgG1 isotype.
                    High titers of anti-R-13 antibodies were associated with cardiac heart disease.
                    However, no direct correlation exists between the T. cruzi and R- 13 antibody
                    titers. This work demonstrates that a) the anti-R-13 reactivity is a relevant
                    component of the anti T. cruzi reactivity from chagasic sera, b) the level of
                    anti-R-13 antibodies is correlated to the cardiac status of the patients, c) the
                    anti-R-13 response is specific to T. cruzi infection since sera from P.
                    falciparum, Leishmania and african Trypanosoma ïinfected humans were usually
                    negative. The results suggest that cross- reactive epitopes between the parasite
                    and the host may elicite a strong humoral response at the chronic stage of the
                    disease.</p>

                    recombinants, we isolated two strong reactive clones : 1.31 and 1.21. Antibodies
                    to T.31 were immunoselected and reacted with RA trypo-, epimastigote and L.b.
                    braziliensis Westerns. They reacted strongly with a group of proteins of about

                <p>Previous studies have suggested that the non-specific increase of IgE production
                    stimulated by helminths can modulate the allergic reactivity of infected
                    individuals. We evaluated the allergic reactivity of 200 children (5-15 years
                    old) living in a slum area of Caracas and found the following: 70% suffered
                    intestinal hel- minthic infection, their total serum IgE levels were highly
                    elevated (6.M. 1800 IU/m1l), 3SOZ had subnormal peak expiratory flow rates,
                    their immediate cutaneous reactivity to environmental allergens was low (28%
                    positive), and their positivity in Prausnitz-Kustner passive transfer tests was
                    10w (554). Whilst 877% had detectable levels of specific IgE antibody against
                    these allergens, only 38% had clinically relevant levels. A randomly selected
                    group of 100 of these children was treated regularly with oxantel/pyrantel
                    (Quantrel) for one year. This resulted in a S-fold reduction in total IgE levels
                    and significant increases in all aspects of allergic reactivity. Our results
                    support the concept of mast cell blockade by excess IgE, and suggest that this
                    is reversible by anti-parasite treatment.</p>

                    mansoni (17 cases) or both S. mansoni and S. haematobium (35 cases). À control
                    group consisted of 20 normal children. Cirdulating schistosomal antigen (CSA)
                    was detected in 54 % of schistosomal-infected children using the ELISA
                    technique. There was a tendency for antigenaemia to increase with age (mean =
                    0,076 in those prepuber- tal ; aged 8 to 13 and 0.149 in those aged 14 to 15
                    years respectively, P 0.001).</p>
                <p>CSA was significantly more frequent in cases with albumin-uria (78.84%).
                    Complement C3 was higher in schistosomal-infected children (m = 149.7 mg/d1)
                    than in controls (m = 121,5 mg/d1l, P &lt; 0.001). This was more marked in the
                    prepubertal children (m = 163.1 mg/d1) than in the pubertal ones (m = 141.06
                    mg/d1l) demonstrating decrease with age (P &lt; 0.001). Hepatitis B surface
                    antigen (HBsAg) was detected in 15 %, all of whom were in the older age
                    group.</p>
                <p>We conclude that CSA can be detected in children as in adults. Tendency for CSA
                    to increase and C3 to decrease with age suggesting the development of immune
                    comple- xes. This study highlights differences in immune responses between both
                    age groups that could be attributed to the hormonal changes that accompany
                    puberty through im- mune-endocrine interactions rather than to the disease
                    process itself. This study should open the door to future studies on
                    imnune-endocrine interactions in these patients.</p>

                    Plasmodium Ciparum, autoantibodies, heat shock protein A 72kD polypeptide of
                    Plasmodium falciparum_ has been identified as a member of the 70KkD heat shock
                    protein family (Hsp70). In spite of the degree of homology to the host protein,
                    the parasitic Hsp70-like polypeptide induces high levels of antibodies. It
                    follows that an immune response to the P. falciparum Hsp70 could induce
                    autoreactive antibodies. In order to address this question, we have analysed the
                    humoral immune response to the human Hsp70 and the 72kD heat shock-like protein
                    of P. falciparum using 80 sera from Brazilian malaria patients. Our results
                    indicates that autoreactive antibodies are generated against the human Hsp70
                    during the natural infection with malaria parasites.</p>

                <p>Eggs of Porocephalus crotali hatch in rodent intermediate hosts and larvae then
                    encyst in a variety of tissues to undergo six moults to an infective seventh
                    stage larvae by 120 days post infection (dpi). Each is the focus of an intense
                    eosinophilic granuloma, with the peak influx occurring during each moult.
                    Traditional metachromatic staining methods indicate that large numbers of mast
                    cells are recruited to the granuloma as well. Recruitment is irrespective of the
                    site, so that large numbers of mast cells can accumulate in tissues and organs
                    normally devoid of such cells (e.g.</p>
                <p>abdominal fat bodies or liver). Peak recruitment occurs around 70-80 dpi when
                    nymphs moult to the infective stage, thereafter the response declines. The bulk
                    of infil- trating cells are mucosal mast cells (MMC) as demonstrated
                    histologically using fluorescent-antibodies against rat mast cell proteinases
                    (RMCP). ELISA's against RMCP II reveal that the localised recruitment of MMCs by
                    Porocephalus attains unpre- cedented levels, (e.g. 206ug RMCP II/500 um diameter
                    cyst at 41 dpi and 268ug RMCP 11/1300 jm cyst at 75 dpi). Serum levels of
                    circulating RMCP II show a concomitant rise to 3.05ug/ml and 3.50 pg/ml during
                    the same period. Levels of RMCP II in control tissues and serum were barely
                    detectable. The role of parasite products in MMC recruitment will be
                    discussed.</p>

                    Malaria- Cytokine- TNF- Primate- Crisis AS in several malaria host-parasite
                    systems, during a blood infection of Plasmodium cynomolgi in its natural host,
                    the toque monkey, Macaca sinica, peak parasitaemia is often accompanied by a
                    "crisis" in the infection; crisis is most pronounced in splenectomised animals
                    and is characterised by the appearance of morphologically abnorml
                    intraerythrocytic parasites and a sudden loss of infectivity of the parasites to
                    mosquitoes which persists for 4 to 6 days. Loss of infectivity at crisis is
                    shown here to be due to death of circulating intra-erythrocytic gametocytes
                    mediated by crisis serum; incubation of gametocytes in crisis serum for 3 hours
                    completely abolished infectivity. These killing effects in the crisis serum are
                    due to the presence of the cytokines tumour necrosis factor (TNF) and gamma
                    interferon (gamma IFN); the addition of anti-TNF and anti-gammalFN antibodies to
                    crisis serum abolished killing effects. Recombinant TNF and gammalFN restored
                    gametocyte killing properties when added to crisis serum depleted of these
                    cytokines, however recombinant cytokines alone had no effect on gametocytes when
                    added to normal serum.</p>
                <p>The killing activity of each cytokine is therefore absolutely dependent upon the
                    presence of additional, as yet unidentified, factor(s) in the crisis serum.
                    Culture supernants from lipo-polysaccharide (LPS) stimulated monkey peripheral
                    blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) had similar zametocyte killing properties which
                    were removed by anti-TNF antibodies. The addition or recombinant TNF to TNF
                    depleted PBMC culture supernatant restored the killing effects. Thus the
                    "additional" factor required for the killing effects of these cytokines were
                    being produced by LPS stimulated PBMCs.</p>

                    compared with high dose syringe or tsetse challenge in 2 additional waterbuck.
                    Cattle responded to increasing parasitemia with large decreases in all blood
                    cell components. Platelets and erythrocytes were the most severely affected,
                    resulting in severe anemia about 6 weeks after infection. Waterbuck showed only
                    minimal evidence of hematological changes, even at times of high parasitemia.
                    Although all waterbuck became infected, parasitemia was extremely variable, and
                    did not appear to be related to the level of challenge. Waterbuck coped with
                    infection through increased cellular proliferation of all blood cell series.
                    This was particularly evident in erythrocyte indices, which increased during the
                    course of infection. Changes in erythrocyte indices were associated with a
                    strong reticulocyte response that was absent in cattle. These results suggest
                    that the pathology of disease in cattle is largely related to bone marrow
                    insufficiency. How wildlife species avoid the immunosuppressive effects of high
                    parasite numbers is currently under investigation.</p>

                <p>Inbred mouse strains have showed a variable spectrum of susceptibility depending
                    on the Trypanosoma cruzi strain. Although the natural human infection takes
                    place with few parasites, experimental mouseinfection has been performed with
                    large inocula. Infections with few parasites produce irregular and sometimes
                    subpatent parasitemias in mice. To in- vestigate the course of low
                    inocula-induced acute Chagas'disease, 4 in- bred mouse lines were infected with
                    10 bloodstream Y strain forms and examined the specific antibody response,
                    frequence of parasitemia, mortality and histoimmunopathology. Balb/cJ, C57B1/6J
                    and DBA/2J mice showed focal immunoperoxidase negative mononuclear cell
                    infiltrate in cardiac and skeletal muscle on the 7th day after infectio.
                    CS3H/HeJ showed focal myocarditis on the 14th day and confluent mononuclear
                    infiltrate in skeletal muscle on the 21th. All mice, except CS3H, showed diffuse
                    myocarditis and miositis 21 days after infection. Nests of intracellular
                    parasites were detected around the 21th day in Balb/c and C3H, 7th day in B6 and
                    14th day in DBA/2, simultaneously with the highest frequency of parasitemia.
                    Frequencies of patent and subpatent parasitemia were different in two mouse
                    strains. The mortality rates were high: 10% Balb/c at 35 days, 65% C3H at 30
                    days, 90% B6 at 45 days and 100% DBA/2 at 25 days. Altogether, the results
                    indicate that 10 T.cruzi Ÿ strain are sufficient to induce acute Chagas'disease
                    and that this strain is highly virulent for inbred mouse lines reported as
                    resistant to other strains.</p>

                    lymphocytes increased 5 fold by day 14, only in the lymph nodes (LN) draining
                    the vaccination site. There were also increases up to day 21 in the number of
                    leucocytes (lymphocytes x30; polymorphs x5; macrophages x1) recovered from the
                    lungs by bronchoalveolar lavage. The relative importance of the events occurring
                    in these tissues was analysed using à number of different vaccination regimes.
                    For example, cercariae irradiated with 80-krad induced lymphocyte responses
                    sinilar to V20 cercariae, but failed to generate a lung cell population,
                    vwhereas optimally attenuated lung parasites injected intravenousiy elicited a
                    good pulmonary response without stimulating the skin draining LN. Neither regime
                    alone induced high levels of resistance. When used in combination they elicited
                    cell responses, both in the draining LN and the lungs, which paralleled those
                    after inmunisation with V20 cercariae.</p>
                <p>Xoreover, these mice were highly protected against reinfection. We suggest that
                    the induction of high levels of protection requires; (1) elicitation of specific
                    lymphocytes in the LN draining the vaccination site as à result of efficient
                    antigen presentation in the node, and (2) recruitment of cells from the expanded
                    population to the lungs or stisulation of relevant lymphocytes in pulmonary
                    tissue, following the arrival of "parasite antigen". The requirement for (2) may
                    explain the relativly low efficacy of the non-living vaccines so far described
                    in the literature.</p>

                    PLASMODIA,HEPATIC-STAGES,CRP,INFLAMMATION, IMMUNITY We have shown in previous in
                    vitro studies, that at low dose (SU/ml) interleukin-1 (IL-1) strongly inhibited
                    hepatic schizont development of Plasmodium falciparum and P. yoelii (98%).We
                    demonstrated in vitro that this effect was at least in part mediated by
                    C-reactive protein (CRP), secreted by IL-1 stimulated hepatocytes. In vivo
                    experiments confirmed inhibitory effects of this acute vhase protein (APP).</p>
                <p>In order to pinpoint the mode of action of CRP, experiments were performed using
                    a double staining technique. Two effects were observed: 1) blockage of
                    sporozoite penetration 2) intrahepatic blocking of parasite division through an
                    antibody-like effect. Nevertheless, CRP alone does not account for the effects
                    of the inflammatory response. Analysis of the roles played by hepatocytes and/or
                    rat sera with a high level of circulating APPs, showed that inflammatory
                    proteins other than CRP are involved in protection. Our observation underlines
                    the complexity of host immune defence mechanisms, where non-specific factors

                    immunotherapy, peripheral and spleen leucocytes, activation by IL 2 Cure in
                    infections by Leishmania donovani requires the elimination of the parasite from
                    its obligate intracellular niche in macrophages. We have studied the
                    effectiveness of IL 2-activated peripheral blood (PBL) and macrophage-depleted
                    spleen leucocytes (SL) obtained from infected animals to effect the cure of
                    infected cells in vitro and in vivo. One x 10° infected peritoneal macrophage
                    targets were co- -cultured with 5 x 10° syngeneic effector PBL and SL obtained
                    from mice two weeks into their infection, when these cells are anergic to
                    stimulation by antigen or mitogens; prior to co-culture, the effectors were
                    activated with the IL 2-containing supernatant of the MLA-144 cell line. The
                    burden of parasites in the targets was significantly reduced by these activ-
                    ated cells; reduction was more marked when the targets and effectors were
                    obtained from mice of the resistant Lsh phenotype (C57BL/6J3) than when they
                    were obtained from animals of the susceptible Lsh phenotype (C57L/J). C57BL/6J
                    mice, infected for 17 days, were treated intravenously with 1 x 108 syngeneic
                    macrophage-depleted SL obtained from animals 2 weeks into their infection; prior
                    to injection, these cells were also activ- ated with IL 2. This therapy in vivo
                    also reduced significantly the level of infection as determined by the LDU of
                    the hepatocytes of the treated, infected animals; supplementary injections of IL

                    effect to reduce infection either in vitro or in vivo. The significant reduction
                    in the level of infection obtained in this study indicates that immunotherapy
                    with lymphokine-activated leucocytes presents an effective candidate strategy

                    patients who presented to the Center of Malariology, Ciudad Bolivar, Venezuela,
                    with symptoms of malaria. A RIA for TNF was used. Forty adult males aged 17-43
                    years, with malaria due to Plasmodium vivax were selected for this study; 35
                    patients (Group I) had circulatina parasites and 5, were convalescent (Group
                    Il); 23 patients of group I referred to a first episode of malaria (Group I-A)
                    and 12, had suffered multiple malaria attacks (Group I-B). Fifty per cent of
                    patients in Group I-A had plasma TNF levels of over 350 pg/ml but the other 50%
                    showed TNF levels comparable to those of healthy adults, 66% of patients of
                    group I-B had not detectable TNF plasma levels. In group II, 3 out of 5
                    convalescents, although asymptomatic had increased TNF levels. Examination of
                    antibody agaîinst P. vivax by ELISA with homologous antigens failed to reveal
                    any relation betwen FNF Tevels and the serum antibody titers against the

                    the severity of malaria in patients suffering a first attack. However, it Seems
                    that past experience with the parasite modulates the in vivo levels of circula

                <p>In mice vaccinated with a single dose of irradiated cercariae of S. mansoni,
                    there is much evidence of an association between pulmonary leukocytic responses
                    and immunity.We have studied the magnitude and kinetics of mononuclear-cell
                    recruitment to the lungs during vaccinating and challenge infections, in order
                    to evaluate its relevance to the induction of resistance and elimination of
                    challenge parasites. Cells from the spleens of naïve donors were labelled with
                    51-chromium and injected intravenously into recipient mice at different times
                    post vaccination and challenge. Distribution of cells to various organs was
                    assessed 24 hours later. À significantly greater influx of radiolabelled cells
                    was observed in the lungs of vaccinated mice than in either naïve animals, or
                    those exposed to normal parasites. Recruitment began at day 10 and peaked at day
                    16, when 50% more radioactivity was detected in vaccinated than normally
                    infected lungs; it had diminished to background levels by day 22. Flow-cytometry
                    of bronchoalveolar lavage samples has shown that cells persist at elevated
                    levels for 10 weeks. The magnitude and timing of post-challenge responses remain
                    unclear, varying according to vaccination and challenge sites. Although
                    ultrastructural studies have demonstrated the formation of mononuclear-cell foci
                    around challenge parasites in the lungs of vaccinated mice, the secondary
                    response appears to be smaller than the primary response. Only 24% more
                    radioactivity was detected in test than control lungs on day 10 post challenge.
                    One explanation is that whereas cellular infiltrates in the vaccinating
                    infection are dispersed, those after challenge are focal. It is also possible
                    that unresponsiveness induced by vaccination leads to downregulation of
                    responses after challenge.</p>

                <p>We used cultures of hepatic stages of Plasmodium falciparum and P. yoelii to
                    analyse the expression of malaria heat-shock like proteins likewise their
                    functional and/or biological roles. Two monoclonal antibodies (Mabs 1C11 and
                    D4F18), recognizing two different determinants of the C-terminal fragment of the
                    P. falciparum heat- shock like protein SE and sera obtained after immunization
                    with the purified protein of P. yoelit (Pyhsp70), revealed that synthesis of
                    this antigen first occurs during intrahepatic development of the parasite, at
                    the two nuclei stage. Moreover, and in contrast with the anti-Pyhsp70 sera, both
                    Mabs recognize their determinants on the infected hepatocyte membrane.
                    Functional assays have shown that serum but never the Mabs inhibited the hepatic
                    development of the parasite. However a cytotoxic effect (up to 50 % lysis) was

                <p>The role of cell-mediated immune response to P. falciparum infection is still
                    poorly understood. We prospectively followed 16 patients (11 Europeans and 5
                    Africans) presenting with a clinical malarial attack due to P. falciparum to
                    examine various indirect measures of T-cell activity: granulocyte-macrophage
                    colony stimulating factor (GM- CSF), gamma-interferon (y-IF), tumor necrosis
                    factor (TNF), soluble interleukin-2 receptors (IL2R), and neopterin (Neop). Each
                    cytokine level was measured by immunoassay commercial kits, Neop levels were
                    measured by HPLC. Serum marker positivity was based on values from European and
                    African controls. Blood samples were collected from each patient on the day of
                    admission, 1 day later, the first day of negative thick blood smear, and in 5
                    patients, on days 7 to 9. On admission, serum levels of TNF, IL2R, and Neop were
                    elevated; the levels of GM- CSF and y-IF were also higher in patients than in
                    controls, but the difference was not significant. Levels of y-IF, TNF, IL2R, and
                    Neop were higher in European than in African patients, while the opposite was
                    observed with GM-CSF. Serum markers levels did not vary during the follow-up,
                    with the exception of Neop being lower on D7 to D9 than before. In a given
                    individual, levels of IL2R were correlated with the number of red blood cells
                    (rbcs) (r = 0.74), white blood cells (wbcs) (r = 0.65), and thrombocytes (r =
                    0.63). Neop was inversely correlated with the number of rbcs (r = - 0.60) and
                    wbes (r= - 0.84). The levets of GM-CSF and TNF were correlated with parasite
                    counts (r = 0.61 and 0.71, respectively). IL2R levels were correlated with those
                    of y-IF, TNF, and Neop; similarly, y-IF levels were correlated with those of
                    Neop. These data demonstrate massive T-cell activation during acute P.</p>

                    hypothesized that the mast cell is the primary immunologic effector of
                    transepithelial electrogenic Cl secretion induced by either luminal challenge
                    (LC) or serosal challenge (SC) with trichinella antigen of jej- unum of the

                    current (I is used as an index of electrogenic Cl se- cretion. During the AT two
                    months post infection, the mouse jejunum was sensitized to both LC and SC. At
                    later times, tissue was sensitive only to SC. At six weeks post infection, after
                    LC, the jejunum was still fully responsive to secondary SC, whereas after
                    primary SC, the tissue was completely refractory to secondary LC. Because of the
                    epithelial barrier to the transport of macromolecules, LC may stimulate only
                    those immunologic effectors present in the epithelium. In contrast, SC may ex-
                    pose antigen-sensitive effectors in both the epithelial and mucosal lay- ers. À
                    combined treatment which antagonized the actions of both hista- mine and
                    serotonin in the intestine abolished the I response to LC, whereas the response
                    to SC was only partially inhib?£ed. The neuronal blocker, tetrodotoxin,
                    inhibited the increase in I to a significantly greater extent than the response
                    to SC. These resülts suggest that the route of antigenic challenge influences

                    Seven batches (10 each) of white mice of the homozygotic CD-1 strain (Mus
                    muculus) were inoculated with an immunogen preparation made from five different
                    strains of Trypanosoma Cruzi isolated in different regions of México, and later
                    on, each mouse of the seven batches was confronted (intraperitonealliy) with
                    1,000,000 T cruzi tripomastigotes of the Queretaro strain. Curves of parasites
                    in blood were made for each mouse, counthing the number of tripomastigotes
                    present in the blood starting on the 8th day after inoculation until the mouse
                    died. In case that no death occurred, the curves were followed up to 90 days.
                    Tripomastigotes were counted by means of a Neubauer white blood cells counter
                    chamber. The heart, liver, and brain were removed from the dead mice, dissected
                    and fixed in 10% formaline, embedded in parafin, then histological sections were
                    made, stained with hematoxylin-eoxin and mounted. From each dissected organ, 10
                    histological sections were obtained and 100 microscopic fields were counted with
                    a 10X oclens and a 100X objective to determine the amount of amastigote nests.
                    The same procedure was performed with the mice that did not die at the end of
                    the 90 days of observation. Results are depicted on a series of tables and
                    graphs, and they are discussed in the ligt of present knowledge.</p>

                <p>A histopathological study of skin lesions was performed to quantitatively assess
                    the cellular reaction in susceptible BALB/c, vaccinated BALB/c ‘and resistant
                    CBA/T6T6 mice, infected subcutaneously with 2X107 promastigotes of Leishmania

                    neutrophils, mononuclear cells, lymphocytes and fibroblasts was examined on days
                    3,7,14,35 and 56. In BALB/c mice early infiltration (days 3-7) was characterised
                    by high numbers of mast cells (71.5/mm2 normal mice, 134.3/mm2 vaccinated mice),
                    eosinophils (447.7/mm2 normal mice, 2755.2/mm2 vaccinated mice) and macrophages
                    (1308.6/mm* normal mice, 1008.6/mm£ vaccinated mice).</p>
                <p>Lymphocyte numbers were also higher (150.7/mm2 normal mice, 122.9/mm2 vaccinated
                    mice).</p>
                <p>There was a sustained increase in epidermal thickness from 2 cells to 16
                    cells.</p>
                <p>CBA/T6T6 mice showed a different cellular profile with lymphocytes predominant in
                    early stages (day 7, 700/mm2) and in late stages (day 35, 500/mm“&lt;). Mast
                    cells number were highest on day 7 (61.5/mm2), eosinophils were higher on day 7
                    (355.6/mm2). This study suggests that mast cells and eosinophils may play an
                    important role during the early response to cutaneous Leishmaniasis.</p>

                    cytokines, fibroblasts We have postulated that cytokines produced by host cells
                    that comprise the egg granulomas are involved in the pathogenesis of hepatic
                    fibrosis in schistosomiasis mansoni. We previously reported that egg granulomas
                    isolated from liver of Schistosoma mansoni-infected mice spontaneously secrete
                    fibrogenic factors when cultured in vitro. These factors include ones that in
                    vitro stimulate fibroblast chemotaxis, proliferation, and collagen and
                    glycosaminoglycan synthesis. We now report on our successful purification of the
                    granuloma-derived growth factor. We have seginated this factor "“"fibroblast
                    stimulating factor-l1" (FsF-1) pending its specific molecular identification and
                    determination of its other biological activities. FsF-1 is purified from
                    conditioned medium by a three-step scheme that involves gel-filtration, heparin-
                    affinity chromatography, followed finally by ion exchange FPLC (to separate
                    FsF-1 from contaminating heparin). SDS-PAGE analysis (silver stain) of the
                    purified material reveals a single band with Mr-=60kD.</p>
                <p>FsF-1 lacks endothelial-cell stimulating activity, indicating that it is distinct
                    from the previously-described heparin-binding fibroblast growth Éactors.
                    Furthermore, we determined that it is not PDGF or several other known fibroblast
                    growth factors or cytokines. Antibodies raised against purified FsF-1 are being
                    employed to identify its cell source and anatomic distribution within infected
                    liver. FsF-1 may be the molecular link between granulomatous inflammation and
                    hepatic fibrosis.</p>

                <p>In areas endemic for lymphatic filariasis caused by the nematode parasite B.
                    malayi, three epidemiological groups can be identified: 1) endemic normals, who
                    are exposed to the bite of infected mosquitos but harbour no detectable
                    infection, 2) asymptomatic microfilaraemics, individuals that are infected but
                    show no clinical disease and 3) patients with elephantiasis. Comparison of
                    immunological parameters between the 3 groups can lead to understanding of
                    mechanisms responsible for pathology.</p>
                <p>The cytokine network and its interaction with granulocytes probably plays an
                    important role in initiating or maintaining genesis of pathology. We collected
                    plasma and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMNC) from 96 individuals
                    residing in an area endemic for B. malayi in Sumatra, Indone- sia. The levels of
                    cytokines in circulation and in supernatants from the study population are being
                    determined. The state of granulocyte, namely mast cell, activation is being
                    studied by measuring mast cell tryptase levels in plasma. The results will be
                    compared between the three epidemiological groups.</p>

                    accompanied by disturbing and sometimes lethal compli- cations. In the present
                    randomized, parallel, double-blind study in 38 Gabonese patients we tested the
                    protective role of C 10 mg bid versus DE 6 mg bid given during the first 10 days
                    of a stepwise treatment of TI, bv DI. Both C and DE improved significantly (p
                    0.002) pruritus assessed by the patients on a visual analog scale, or scored by
                    the investigator at day 4 and 10. Similarly total pruritus severity score as
                    well as dura- tion (continuous versus intermittent), time (day versus night or
                    versus night and day), and extension (local, extended) of the pruritus were
                    sionificantly (p&lt;0.02) improved by C and DE at day 4 and day 10 (except p =
                    0.06 for C at day 4 for insomnia). There is no statistica]ysignificant
                    difference at day 4 between both drugs. C is significantly (p = 0.05) better
                    than DE on duration of pruritus at day 10. Also at dav 10, a trend
                    (0.5&lt;pK&lt;0.10) in favour of C is observed for the pruritus assessed by the
                    investigator, total severity score and time of pruritus. L. loa microfilariae
                    are sianificantly and similarly decreased under both C and DE at day 10. There
                    is no statistically signifi- cant difference in side-effects between both drugs.
                    It is concluded that C (10 mg bid) is superior over DE (6 mg bid) in preventing
                    some of the symptoms of loiasis treated by DI. C is know to act on the migration
                    of eosinophils in some allergic processes. From the present study it appears
                    that this property has no negative influence on loiasis suffering patients
                    treated by DI. Results on the measurement of some eosinophil cationic protein
                    are presented and a discussion on the role of eosinophils in allergy and in
                    parasitic disease is made.</p>

                <p>14% (2/14) of patients with urinary stones and 65% (13/20) of those with

                    blood. Giant cells and activated macrophage could also be seen. Eosinophils were
                    seen adherent and degranulating over ova. Electron microscopy confirmed that
                    most of these cells were eosinophils. Adherence and degranulation of these cells
                    were accompanied by egg shell destruction and meracidial damage. . . . , . , The
                    degree of eosinophiluria in urinary schistosomiasis is higher than reported in
                    other diseases, In patients With haematuria, eosinophiluria favour the diagnosis
                    of urinary schistosomiasis. Eosinophiluria may result from slouphing of
                    granuloma, exudation and bleeding from the bladder surface. These cells play
                    some role in the destruction of egg of Schistosoma haematobium.</p>

                <p>Pelodera strongyloides, Leukocytes, Nematoda The purpose of this study is to
                    develop a method to observe nematode-stage specific mammalian leukocytic
                    responses. Pelodera strongyloides is readily maintained at room temperature in
                    petri plates of nutrient agar overlayed with Escherichia coli. The maximum
                    length of the nematode is less than 1.8 mm. The stages of the worm were
                    differentiated using scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron
                    microscopy (TEM), and light microscopy. Structural features as well as limits in
                    length and width can be used to differentiate stages using light microscopy.
                    Changes in cuticular morphology and the development of external genitalia can be
                    used to distinguish stages with SEM. The thickness of the cuticle as well as
                    deposition of a periodic aciâ-Schiff positive substance on the surface of the
                    worm can be used to differentiate stages with TEM. Dauer larvae show two
                    distinct cuticles. Mast cells, eosinophils, and neutrophils invade tissue of
                    rats innoculated with P. strongyloides. Mast cells and eosinophils attach to the
                    surface of the worms. Mast cells have been observed to attach, swell, and
                    degranulate at the surface of adult male and fourth stage larval worms.</p>
                <p>Separate populations of rat eosinophils, neutrophils, or mononuclear cells show
                    little attachment to the surface of all stages of the worm at a concentration of
                    3 x 104 cells/worm in the presence of serum with and without active complement
                    in vitro. Mixed inite cell populations readily attach to all stages of the worm
                    except the dauer larva.</p>

                <p>Eosinophilia, Trichinellosis Eosinophilia is implicated int he pathogenesis and
                    clinical presentation of Trichine- llosis. We observed the recount of
                    eosinophils and it's relation with the clinical and biochemical dates in an
                    outbreak of trichinellosis secondary to the ingestion of a pa- rasited wild
                    boar. We studied 65 symptomatic patients (39M,26F), mean age 31+- 14 years. We
                    used as diagnosis muscle biopsy in a case and serologic confirmation in the
                    rest. Eosinophilia was presented by 48 patients (78%), eigth of them was
                    superior to 2500 cel/mm3, in the first determination(% day). After six weeks,
                    eosinophilia persis- ted in 49,1% but all were asymptomatic. Significative
                    correlation was found between existence and severity of eosinophilia with the
                    duration of intestinal phase (vomiting, abdominal pain, diarrhea). No
                    significative correlation was found with the presence and duration of symptoms
                    int he invasive phase (fever, facial edema, myalgia, conjuntivi- tis) neither
                    wtih muscle enzymes elevation (CK, aldolase).</p>
                <p>SUMMARY: .-Eosinophilia rate is the most frecuent analytic alteration that
                    persists even the remission of the symptoms. 2.- Eosinophilia rate is in
                    relation with the dura- tion of the intestinal period which plays an important
                    role in the immunologic stimulus of the illness.3.- No correlation is observed
                    between eosinophilia and the rest of the analytic and clinical dates, so it must
                    not be considered a gravity index.</p>

                    eosinophils Hypodense eosinophils are observed in the peripheral blood from
                    patients with helminthic infection. The role of the Éppésléns eosinophils is
                    still obsecure. In this study, distribution and function of hypodense
                    eosinophils were examined äin Wistar rats infected with Trichinella spiralis
                    (T.sp) as an animal model. Eosinophils were obtained from peripheral blood
                    (PBEo) or peritoneal fluid (PFEo) of infected rats. The density of eosinophils
                    was determined by discontinuous gradient centrifugation with metrizamide.
                    Prominent eosinophilia was observed in peripheral blood at 2 weeks and in
                    peritoneal fluid at 2 to 3 weeks after infection. Ali of PBEo from uninfected
                    rats were normodense (density &gt;1.125g/ml). However, 30% of PBEo were
                    hypodense (density &lt;1.125) at 2 weeks after infection. 90% of PFEo were
                    hypodense before and during the infection. Hypodense PFEo were further separated
                    into two groups, À (density &gt;1.105) and B (density &lt;1.105). Group B
                    eosinophils was markedly increased during 2 to 3 weeks of infection, and were
                    50% of total PFEo.</p>
                <p>In uninfected rats, group B eosinophils were 30% of total PFEo.</p>
                <p>Antibody-dependent killing activity against newborn larva of T.sp was examined
                    with these two groups of eosinophils. Group B eosinophils showed significantly
                    higher killing activity than that in group À eosinophils (46+3% vs 28+6%,
                    p&lt;0.05). These extremely hypodense eosinophils (group B eosinophils) might be

                    know if helminthotoxic eosinophils were capable of damaging the heart and lungs
                    of infected animals independent of the migration of infective Toxocara canis
                    juveniles. Bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) of rats infected with 2,000 ova of T.
                    canis 14 days postinfection yielded 6.5X107 cells of which 88+3% were
                    eosinophils (Eos).</p>
                <p>These cells were added to the perfusion buffer being pumped at constant flow
                    through an isolated, normal rat lung suspended from a spring-counterbalanced
                    force transducer and maintained in an isogravimetric state. Arterial, venous,
                    and airway pressures were measured by pressure transducers connected to canulas
                    tied in the left ventricle, pulmonary artery and trachea, respectively. Vascular
                    endothelial permeability was assessed by measuring the capillary filtration
                    coefficient (K;.) using the rate of weight gain after a microvascular pressure
                    increase in the perfused lungs. Lungs challenged with no cells or nonactivated
                    Eos, showed no changes in lung hemodynamics or K;.. The addition ofonly2X10f

                    Airway resistance also increased in lungs receiving activated cells. When hearts
                    from the cell donor animals were placed on a working heart apparatus and
                    perfused with Krebs-Henseleit buffer, marked decrements were observed in peak
                    cardiac output; cardiac work; left ventricular pressure, and rates of
                    contraction and relaxation (+dP/4T, -dP/dT, respectively) as compared with
                    hearts from uninfected rats. We conclude that activated eosinophils are capable
                    of producing increases in vascular resistance and permeability in the lung as
                    well as deceases in function of the heart and lungs over and above the damage
                    that might be attributable to migrating T. canis juveniles. (Supported by Grants

                    Trypanosoma cruzi, Chagas' disease, chagasic myocarditis, eosinophil
                    infiltration Although the presence of inflammatory cells in chagasic lesions has
                    been described, the role(s) of these cells in host defense or lesion development
                    remain to be precisely defined. We studied histologically the density of
                    mononuclear cell, neutrophil and eosinophil infiltration in heart tissue lesions
                    from one acute and nine chronic chagasic patients. The largest numbers of all
                    types of inflammatory cells were found in necrotic lesions. However, unlike
                    other inflammatory cell types, the extent of eosinophil infiltration appeared to
                    correlate with lesion severity and the overall degree of myocarditis. These
                    observations were corroborated by immunohistochemical studies using antisera
                    specific for various human eosinophil granule components. We detected deposits
                    of eosinophil secretion products on myofibers and in the interstitium of
                    chagasic myocardium displaying necrosis and degeneration but rarely in other,
                    milder types of lesions. These deposits of eosinophil material were not
                    detectable in the myocardium of non-chagasic patients who had died from other
                    cardiac diseases. When purified human eosinophil granule components were
                    incubated with cultured myoblast monolayers, significant cell injury and
                    detachment occurred. Additional in vitro studies showed that co-culture of human
                    eosinophils and T. cruzi amastigotes in the medium overlaying myoblast cultures
                    caused myoblast injury. Such effect was not seen when only eosinophils or
                    parasites were present in the myoblast cultures. Deposits of eosinophils granule
                    components were also found on cultured myoblasts incubated with eosinophils plus
                    T. cruzi. Myoblast injury in this in vitra system appeared to be mediated by
                    eosinophils secretion products since Supernatants of co-cultures of eosinophils

                <p>TNF - Eosinophilic leukemia - Schistosoma japonicum Tumor necrosis factor (TNF)
                    has been shown to enhance eosinophil- or platelet-mediated cytotoxicity to
                    schistosomula. The present study was carried out to examine if TNF enhances
                    antibody- dependent cytotoxicity of human eosinophilic leukemia cell lines,
                    EoL-1 and EoL-3, to mechanically transformed schistosomula of Schistosoma
                    japonicum. The EoL cells were preincubated with various concentrations of human
                    rTNF (Suntory Institute for Biomedical Research). Results indicated that rTNF
                    was able to stimulate the killing activity of EoL-3 cells in the presence of
                    serum obtained from patients with schistosomiasis even at a low dose of 0.07
                    U/ml, whereas EoL-1 cells did not show any cytotoxicity even after the treatment
                    of the cells with such a high concentration of rTNF as 70 U/ml. Observation by a
                    slow- motion camera demonstrated that EoL-3 cells might adhere to the surface of
                    schistosomula within the first incubation period of 6 hr. Then, intracellular
                    movement of eosinophil granules was activated and the granules were concentrated
                    toward the surface of schistosomula. EoL-1 cells did not adhere to schistosomula
                    through the observation period at all. Cell sorting analysis by FACStar
                    indicated that the expression of CR3 and Fc RII increased on the surface of
                    EoL-3 cells after stimulation with TNF, while this was not observed for EoL-1

                    suggest that the main factor that contributes to the expression of purified IgG
                    effector function is the degree of activation of the donor's eosinophils.</p>
                <p>This study was designed to test whether eosinophils from normal donors require an
                    activation signal in order to mediate antibody-dependent killing, and whether
                    such activating factors are present in sera from individuals infected with S.
                    mansoni.</p>
                <p>Serum-borne mediators were prepared by fractionation of infection sera by DEAE
                    ion exchange or gel filtration HPLC. The eosinophil-stimulating activity of
                    these mediators was assayed by a new method which depends on the increased
                    expression of the CR3 alpha chain (CDI11b) on the surface of activated
                    eosinophils. In addition, the presence of activating factors in serum was
                    detected by their ability to enhance eosinophil- dependent cytotoxicity against
                    schistosomula. Results showed that purified IgG antibodies did not induce a
                    cytotoxic effect with normal eosinophils. However, incubation of normal
                    eosinophils with eosinophil activating factor (EAF) or with serum- derived
                    mediators induced enhanced expression of CD1ib and increased schistosomulum
                    killing in the presence of 1gG antibodies. Sera from infected individuals
                    exhibited different levels of eosinophil activation, and activation appeared to
                    be due to several serum factors. In conclusion, our results suggest that
                    eosinophil activating factors present in infection sera may not only be
                    responsible for enhancing eosinophil cyto- toxicity, but also be necessary for
                    its expression.</p>

                    during Fasciola hepatica (liver fluke) infection have been examined. The effects
                    of injecting parasite excretory/secretory (E/S) antigens has also been
                    monitored. In this way an attempt has been made to compare qualitative and
                    quantitative changes in the peripheral blood and bone marrow of resistant (rat)
                    and susceptible (mouse) hosts. The number of eosinophils in the peripheral blood
                    and bone marrow of rats infected with 30 F. heparica metacercariae (mc) and mice
                    infected with 5 mc, increased in number by day 7 post-infection. This was also
                    true for rats injected i.v. with 400ug E/S antigens and mice injected similarly
                    with 10011g. Injection of E/S antigens caused peripheral eosinophilia in both
                    rats and mice. Levels in mice dropped by day 8 post-injection, but those in rats
                    remained high. Eosinophil precursors in bone marrow of injected animals also
                    rose. Bone marrow from infected or injected animals was stimulated to divide and
                    form colonies in sloppy agar culture. Bone marrow colony numbers for both rats
                    and mice were greatly enhanced by F. hepatica infection. Bone marrow colony
                    formation in antigen injected mice dropped while a dramatic increase was seen in
                    the number of bone marrow colonies from injected rats. For most parameters
                    measured, the magnitude of the responses of rats (including nude animals) was
                    greater than mice, which may be significant in the context of the rat’s ability
                    to acquire resistance to reinfection.</p>

                    high genetic resitance to H. contortus found in a Merino strain has been
                    associated with more intense infiltration with globule leucocytes and
                    eosinophils in abomasal mucosa of young lambs compared to a susceptible
                    genotype. This study compared faecal egg counts (FEC) after artificial infection
                    of older dry ewes of both genotypes. The inflammatory response after infusion of
                    H.contortus antigen into the mammary gland was evaluated in relation to time of
                    infection as means of discriminating the genotypes. Antigen was in- fused day
                    0,12,21 and 35 post-infection (pi.). EFosinophils and total cells were counted
                    from mammary washings obtained 1 and 14 days after infusion. 37 resistant and 34
                    suscep- tible ewes were infused with antigen. Infected controls received PBS and
                    uninfected con- trols received antigen.</p>
                <p>Results: FEC's showed à significant difference between genotypes of same order as
                    seen previously in lambs. Antigen infusion gave à massive influx of eosinophils,
                    relatively more in resistant ewes. The resistant genotype had a more vigorous
                    response early in in- fection;both groups declined to the level of uninfected
                    controls on day 35 pi. Variation within groups was considerable.</p>
                <p>Conclusion: The resistance expressed as FEC depression in this strain of Merino
                    was also pronounced in mature ewes. It was not possible to discriminate with
                    certainty the two genotypes tested by their intramammary inflammatory response.

                <p>Brugia malayi, IgE, Eosinophilia, Protective immunity It has been reported that
                    IgE antibody in helminth infections is able to induce eosinophilia and play a
                    role for protective immunty. In order to evaluate the effects of IgE in helminth
                    infections on eosinophilia and protective immunity in vivo, IgE-deficient mice
                    provide useful experimental systems. In this study, IgE-deficient and
                    IgE-producing control mice were infected with Brugia malayi(Bm). IgE-deficient
                    mice were obtained by repeated injections of purified anti-mose IgE monoclonal
                    antibody(6HD5) from the day of birth. Anti-IgE treated and control BALB/c mice
                    were injected intraperitoneally with 50 larvae of Bm L3. Total IgE levels,
                    determined by ELISA, were higher than 1000 ng/ml in control mice but iess than
                    10 ng/ml in anti-IgE treated mice at 4 weeks after infection. Anti-Bm IgE
                    antibody was not detected by PCA reaction and ELISA in both mice. Anti- Bm IgG
                    antibody was produced similarly in both mice. Both mice produced comparable
                    amounts of IgA. Blood eosinophilia reached the peak at 3 weeks after infection
                    and was not different between IgE-deficient and control mice. Similar number of
                    L4 at 2 weeks and adults at 5 weeks after primary infection was recovered from
                    both mice. Protective immunity against secon- dary L3 infection was similarly
                    observed in both mice. These results indi- cate that Bm infection in
                    IgE-producing mice induces potentiated IgE production. Blood eosinophilia and
                    protective immunty in Bm infected mice are not dependent on IgE.</p>

                <p>Nippostrongylus brasiliensis - rat pulmonary eosinophilia Many studies indicate
                    that an infection of rats with Nippostrongylus brasiliensis induces à blood and
                    tissue eosinophilia considered to be elicited by migration of larvae through the
                    tissues and the presence of adult worms in the intestine. To test this
                    assumption male rates of the outbred Sabra strain were injected
                    intraperitoneally (i.p.) with 300 adult worms recovered from animals infected
                    subcutaneously (s.c.) 9 days previously with 3000 larvae. The worms became
                    enclosed in nodules formed by adhering peritoneal cells and died within 1-2
                    days. Thus in these hosts there were neîther migrating larvae nor adult worms în

                    of the young adult worms (YA) and 1st stage larvae (L1) of Angiostrongylus
                    cantonensis was assessed by a modification of the Boyden chamber assay using
                    guinea-pig- and rat-eosinophils. Both whole worm extracts were potently
                    chemotactic to guinea-pig-eosinophils whereas only the whole worm extract of Li
                    was chemotactic to rat-eosinophils, suggesting that guinea-pig- and
                    rat-eosinophils differently recognize the eosinophil chemotactic factor of YA.
                    Gel filtration chromatography of YA-whole worm extract yielded an eosinophil
                    chemotactic factor (ECF-YA) with an estimated molecular weight of 16900. ECF-YA
                    was resistant to heating and pronase digestion but sensitive to periodate
                    oxidation, suggesting that chemotactic activity was possibly associated with the
                    sugar portion of the glycoprotein molecule. Guinea-pig- and rat-eosinophils were
                    deactivated by previous incubation with homologous whole worm extracts but not
                    with heterologous ones. When guinea-pig-eosino- phils were treated with trypsin
                    or pronase, their chemotaxis to ECF-YA was significantly inhibited, and pronase
                    treatment was more effective. Both deactivated and trypsin-treat- ed
                    guinea-pig-eosinophils completely recovered their chemotaxis responses after in
                    vitro culture for 12 and 24 h, respectively. When those eosinophils were
                    cultured in vitro in the presence of puromycin or cycloheximide, however, their
                    chemotaxis responses could not be recovered. These data clearly indicate that

                    unit") capable of reacting to ECF-YA, and also that the receptor may be protein
                    or glycoprotein molecules, and reproducible. The presence of ECF-YA receptors on
                    guinea-pig-eosinophils may be possibly associated with eosinophil infiltration

                    Immunization studies Ticks and tick-borne diseases are rarapant in Indian
                    cattle. Immunization against tick infestation is a recent approach. In our
                    study, cross-brea (Bos taurus x Bos indieus) bovine calves were immunized by
                    repeated natural attachment (10 times) by the tick, Hyalomma anatolieur1
                    anatolicum and with the antigens prepared from the tick salivary glands (G Ag).
                    In repeated tick attachment experiments, the tick parameters like per cent
                    engorgerment, egg mass eicht and per cent hatch of eggs showed significant
                    difference from first to tenth infestation. Three types of SG Ag. viz., whole SG
                    Ag. supernatant SG Ag and sediment SG Ag with or without Freund's complete
                    adjuvant (FCA) were used to immunize the calves, and the whole SG Ag with FCA
                    was the most potent irnmunizing agent, but such imrunitv could not be
                    transferred through immune animals' plasma.</p>
                <p>Newzealand white rabbits were immunized with whole tick extract antigen (TE Ag),
                    supernatant TE Ag and pellet TE Ag; and the whole TE Ag with FCA adrinistered on
                    0, 14 and 21 days developed significant resistance in rabbits, as observed by
                    decrease in engorgerment weight and egg mass weight of the female ticks.</p>

                    influence of an antigen-specific cellular immune response, stimulated by
                    immunization, on survival of a challenge infestation of Hypoderma lineatum was
                    investigated. Calves immunized with purified hypodermin À, B, and C in
                    combination with monophosphoryl lipid À (MPL) developed a strong
                    antigen-specific cellular immune response as measured by lymphocyte
                    blastogenesis by completion of the immunization schedule and this persisted to
                    12 weeks post-infestation. Responsiveness of peripheral blood lymphocytes to the
                    mitogens concanavalin À and pokeweed was also elevated at 4 and 12 weeks
                    post-infestation. Western blot analysis demonstrated that immunized calves
                    responded to hypodermin À, B and C while those receiving only MPL or infested
                    controls responded to hypodermin B and C. The antibody response as measured by
                    ELISA was significantly higher in vaccinated calves than in infested controls
                    while the response in calves receiving only immunostimulator was also
                    significantly elevated. Immunized calves produced 5.0 grubs/animal while those
                    receiving ML produced 16.4 grubs/animal and infested controls produced 32.2
                    grubs/animal. Thus vaccination may provide an alternative technique for control
                    of hypodermosis.</p>

                <p>Protective immunization against Trypanosoma cruzi has in the past been evaluated
                    by mea- suring mortality, level of parasitemia, antibody response or pathology.
                    Complete immuni- zation has never been achieved. However, the capacity of
                    experimental vaccines to block parasite transmission between hosts and vectors
                    has very seldom been measured and even partial effects in this regard may be
                    epidemiologically relevant. Groups of 10 to 27 Swiss mice were immunized with 3
                    inocula of 10° live attenuated T. cruzi (TCC) and cha- llenged, together with
                    non-immunized controls with 5 to 50 fecal T. cruzi trypomastigo- tes from wild
                    triatomae. Xenodiagnoses with 10 nymphs were applied to all mice. Vector-
                    host-vector passage of T. cruzi occurred in 236/291 (81%) control mice and only
                    in 165/294 (56%) immunized mice (p« 0.001, cumulated results). The same
                    immunization proto- col applied to guinea pigs exposed to natural T. cruzi
                    infection in adobe yards, produ- ced a similar effect. Out of 32 experiments,
                    the proportion of + xenodiagnoses in the im munized group as compared to the
                    control group was lower in 24, the same in 4 and higher in 4 (p&lt; 0.002). Both
                    in the laboratory and in the field, experimental vaccines can par- tially block
                    host-vector transmission of T. cruzi.</p>

                    glucan with pig immunoglobulin on the presence of T- and B-depedent lymphocytes
                    and circulating antibody level in the peripheral blood was studied in
                    experimental ascarosis of pigs (Ascaris suum) using rosette methods (E, EAC) and
                    ELISA test. The immunomodulator applied has significantly increased the
                    representation of both the cell populations already on day 1 and 2 post
                    invasion. Maximum effect was recorded on day 7 - 9 declining by the day 22 p.i.
                    to the values higher than were the inicial values. On the reinvasion of pigs,
                    levels of both the immunocom- petent cells have considerably increased. The
                    immunomodulator has impres- sively stimulated the IgG antibody level only in the
                    first five days p.i., but with an inconspicuous increase after reinvasion. À 65%
                    protective ef- fect of the immunostimulator has been detected by evaluating the
                    reduc- tion of the number of migrating ascarid larvae in the lungs of pigs. The
                    results are significant in terms of the cognition of possibilities of the
                    non-specific stimulation of immunity in nematodoses.</p>

                    vaccination - baboon - recombinant glutathione S-transferase Among the family of
                    schistosome-derived glutathione S-transferases, the P28-1 molecule was able to
                    confer a high level of protection in rodents experimentally infected with
                    Schistosoma mansoni. To confirm its efficiency in a closer model to man, an
                    immunisation trial was launched on groups of six baboons. One protocol resulted
                    in a significant 38 % reduction of adult worm burden, together with a trend for
                    decrease of reactionnal tissue in the liver.</p>
                <p>Another protocol, different in the number of injections and in the adjuvant
                    composition, could reduce female schistosome fecundity, with a noticeably more
                    pronounced effect on fecal egg output. There was also a trend, in that protocol,
                    for a reduced granuloma surface in the liver, as assessed by morphometric
                    analysis. Different schedules of immunisation with a recombinant molecule can
                    therefore affect Schistosoma mansoni viability and fecundity, with important
                    consequences on disease transmission and egg-induced pathology.</p>

                    adjuvant and delivery systems for vaccine candidate antigens especially for
                    parasitic diseases. Because of the vast literature and experience of using BCG
                    as a vaccine and adjuvant, we are investigating mycobacteria as a host for
                    expressing cloned antigens and examining the immune response generated to the
                    mycobacterial transformants in mice.</p>
                <p>Mycobacterium smegmatis, a fast growing, saprophytic species, has been used as a
                    model system for cloning into BCG. We have begun by cloning the filarial
                    antigen, paramyosin, into an M. smegmatis expression vector and have transformed
                    M. smegmatis with this construct. Stable transformants, as determined by
                    antibiotic resistance and Southern hybridization analysis were obtained and
                    expression of paramyosin, in culture, analyzed by immuno-blot analysis.</p>
                <p>In parallel, we are investigating the adjuvant properties of this mycobacterial
                    species. M. smegmatis was shown to enhance, to the same level as M.
                    tuberculosis, both antibody response (as measured by ELISA) and T cell response
                    (as measure by lymphocyte proliferation and IL3 production) to paramyosin. In
                    addition we have infected mice with live M. smegmatis and have shown that viable
                    M. smegmatis can be recovered in a dose dependent manner one week after
                    infection.</p>

                <p>Hypodermin A, B and C secreted by first instar larvae (L1) of Hypoderma bovis and
                    lineatum have been assayed in previous works for their ability to interact on
                    the inflammatory and specific bovine immune system. Hypodermin À (HA) induced a
                    marked immunodepression in naive cattle, but presented less effect on previously
                    infested animals. These results led us to conclude that previously infested
                    animals, which are partialy protected against hypodermosis, could attenuate the
                    immunodepression induced by HA. In this experiment, we investigated the ability
                    to immunize naïve cattle against a natural hypodermosis infestation, using HA
                    alone or associated with Freund Incomplet Adjuvant (FIA) or Alumine Phosphate
                    (AP). The vaccination protocol involved 3 subcutaneous injections 2 months
                    before the assumed natural infestation. This immunization reduced only partialy
                    the number of larvae and gave a protection of 28,5% (0-60) for HA and 22,5%
                    (0-48) for HA+FIA, but had no effect with HA+AP.</p>
                <p>Analysis of the humoral immune response generated in the HA and HA+FIA vaccinated
                    group indicated an earlier response and a higher level of circulating anti- HA
                    antibodies compared to control and group injected with HA+PA.</p>
                <p>Nevertheless, whathever the stimulation of the humoral immune response, this
                    protocol of immunization does not improve markedly the previous results obtained
                    with crude L1 extracts or partially purified hypodermin immunization.</p>

                    wanted to test whe- ther several associated Mc Abs or polyclonal antibodies
                    could be used, without any adsoption procedures to eliminate any anti-isotope
                    antibodies, as primary reagents instead of a sole Mc Ab. All these primary

                <p>this vaccine has a number of shortcomings including its short storage life. These
                    have restricted its use elsewhere.</p>
                <p>Our group has been developing a non-living vaccine for some years and has
                    identified a number of protective antigens. These antigens have been isolated by
                    a number of trials. One of these antigens has been designated 11C5.</p>
                <p>This gene has been cloned and the antigen expressed as a fusion protein in a
                    number of constructs and has been the subject of many vaccination trials over
                    the past 2.5 years. Only minute amounts of the fusion protein, in a commercially
                    acceptable adjuvant are required to induce high levels of protection (&gt;99%
                    suppression of parasitaemia) in adult cattle to challenge with virulent
                    heterologous strains of B.</p>

                <p>A mouse model was developed for study of immunopotentiation in experimenttal
                    Chagas' disease and tegumentar leishmaniasis. An incipient immunogenicity of
                    trypanosoma- tides subcellular fractions was amplified when BCG was associated
                    in an immunizing sche- dule rendered the mice resistant to an appropriated
                    challenge with virulent Trypanosoma cruzi trypomastigotes or Leishmania
                    amazonensis amastigotes. Trying to adapt the best results to be applied in man
                    we changed the BCG by a delipidated fraction of Corynebacte- rium. Groups of
                    mice receiving 5 ug of P40 (cell wall extracted, lipide deprived from C.
                    granulosum) before a challenge with T. cruzi strain were protected. Varying
                    doses of P40 (0,5 - 50 ug) we saw that even doses as small as 0,5 ug gave good
                    results.</p>
                <p>Mice immunized subcutaneously in the footpad with P40, were able to control par-
                    tially the progression of L. amazonensis infection. The enhancement of mice
                    resistance âgainst Leishmania infection seems to be related with the development
                    of systemic cellu- lar hypersensitivity to P40 antigens, leading to a systemic
                    increase in the microbicidal capacity of the host macrophages. Assays
                    associating the P40 with L. amazonensis promas- tigotes flagellar antigens are
                    in progress.</p>

                    (SM28GST), induced a significant protection against a challenge infection, and
                    led to the production of antibodies mediating eosinophil dependent
                    cytotoxicity.</p>
                <p>In the present report, rats were immunized with one or two injections of this
                    highly purified antigen in the presence of adjuvants compatible with human use
                    (Alum or BCG). Up to 59% of protection could be obtained from a single injection
                    with either adjuvant.</p>
                <p>A follow up study of the humoral response revealed the presence of specific IgE
                    and IgA antibodies. The effector function of these antibodies was evaluated in
                    in vitro cytotoxicity assays in the presence of eosinophils.</p>
                <p>Depletion and competition tests demonstrated that both isotypes are involved in
                    this effector mechanism.</p>

                    cestode infections in the intermediate host, either man or cattle, is the most
                    feasible of all helminth infections, since informations from experimental animal
                    model systems such as Hymenolepis nana and Taenia taeniaeformis/mouse have
                    revealed that the intermediate host mouse infected previously with these
                    cestodes become completely resistant to reinfections. It has been reported that
                    rats vaccinated with antigens extracted from metacestodes of T. taeniaeformis
                    became strongly resistant to challenge infection with oncospheres of this
                    parasite (Kan 1934; Kwa &amp; Liew 1977). However, there is no report for
                    vaccination using metacestode antigens of the heterologous species such as T.
                    crassiceps. Here we report that rats vaccinated with metacestodes of T.
                    crassiceps become resistant to challenge infection with T. taeniaeformis.</p>
                <p>The HYG strain of T. crassiceps supplied by Dr. Kroeze has been maintained in
                    CD-1 female mice in Gifu from 1985. The Rn strain of taeniaeformis, isolated
                    from Rattus norvegicus in Hokkaido, Japan, supplied by Dr. Kamiya has been
                    maintained in rats and cats in Gifu from LU88. Female rats of Wistar strain,
                    6-week- old, purchased from SLC, Japan, were used for vaccination
                    experiments.</p>
                <p>When rats intraperitoneally inoculated with five metacestodes of T. crassiceps on
                    day 0 were challenged orally with approximately 200 oncospheres of T.
                    taeniaeformis ‘a days later, they showed strong resistance to the challenge
                    infection. When vaccinated rats were Killed 30 days and 15 months after the
                    challenge, there were approximately 80 % and 99 % reductions in cystic
                    metacestode recoveries, respectively. In the latter, four of five vaccinated
                    rats harbored no cystic metacestodes at all and the remainder harbored a single
                    metacestode only. Immunoblot analysis has shown that rats given metacestodes of
                    T. crassiceps produce antibodies which react strongly, moderately, and faintly
                    with antigens of 300-day-old mature metacestodes, 30-day-old immature
                    metacestodes and oncospheres of T. taeniaeformis, respectively. Therefore it is
                    strongly suggested that the vaccine effect of metacestodes of T. crassiceps
                    against T. taeniaeformis in rats is directed mainly against metacestode stage of
                    the latter parasite. It is also suggested that antigenic compo- nents of T.
                    taeniaeformis differ not only between oncosphere and 30-day-old immature
                    metacestode stages but also between 30-day-old immature and 300-day-old mature
                    metacestodes.</p>

                    after 9 weeks. Throughout 18 weeks of observation, with mice immunized
                    intraveritoneally, leishmania organisms were cultured from lesions of both

                    Pathology It has been well demonstrated that highly gamma irradiated cercariae
                    of Schistosoma mansoni elicite the high level of immunity against the challenge
                    infection. Even though the nature of this immunity has been mainly analysed in
                    mouse model, the newer laboratory animal model may provide the new facets of
                    immunity to elucidate its mechanisms (McLaren and Smithers, 1987). In this
                    aspect, the gerbil, Meriones unguiculatus, was applied in vaccine immunity of
                    schistosomiasis mansoni. The animals vaccinated with 500 20-krad-gamma
                    irradiated cercariae of S. mansoni, 5 weeks previously, were challenged with
                    normal cercariae, and submitted portal perfusion after 5 weeks of challenge. It
                    is unexpected that the vaccinated animals did rot show any significant immunity
                    (mean percentage of immunity from 38 experiments, 5.7). Furthermore, it should
                    be stressed that gerbils submitted primary infection of 500 normal cercariae
                    showed the myocarditis which might cause their death during 3 to 4 weeks of
                    infection. These immunological and pathological characteristic responses of
                    gerbils to infection with S. mansoni will provide further informations on
                    reinfection immunity and new additional morbidity of this disease as well.
                    Further analysis of these interesting nature is uncer way immunohistochemically

                    antibodies (anti-Id Ab) were prepared by immunizing rabbits with purified
                    monoclonal antibody 1342 specific for asexual stages of Plasmodium falciparum.
                    The specificity of anti-Id Ab was directed against idiotypes of 1342 antibody.
                    The interaction between 13A2 and anti-Id Ab was almost completely inhibited by
                    the original P. falciparum antigen (Pf-Ag), suggesting that the idiotypes
                    recognized by anti-Id Ab were located at the antigen binding site of 13A2.
                    Affinity-purified anti-Id Ab were used to immunize BALB/C mice by repeated
                    intraperitoneal injection. Sera from the mice contained antibodies which bind to
                    P. falciparum and inhibited the binding of 1342 to Pf-Ag. Moreover, after the
                    mice were challenged with Pf-Ag subcutaneously in the ear pinna, measurement of
                    ear swelling showed that prior administration of anti-Id Ab could generate
                    delayed-type hypersensitivity responses. Collectively, these data suggest that
                    the anti- 14 Ab may be useful intæ development of idiotype vaccines against the
                    human malarial parasite, P. £alciparum.</p>

                <p>Malaria- P.vivax- Vaccine- Transmission blocking Monoclonal antibodies have
                    allowed us to define target-antigens of transmission blocking immunity on the
                    surface of P,vivax gametes. One of these monoclonal antibodies, Ai2 which
                    blocked the development of the parasite in membrane feeding experiments, was
                    shown to react both with the contents of the parasitophorous vacuole of asexual
                    erythrocytic stages and with the surface of the free female gamete. On western
                    blots of parasites extracted under reducing conditions, A12 recognizes a 24kDa
                    and a 57 kDa component. À recombinant clone, GAM-1, was isolated by screening of
                    a xgtil expression P,vivax DNA library with A12. Immune mouse serum raised
                    against the purified GAM-1 fusion protein recognizes the same parasite antigens
                    as A1l2 and exhibits transmission blocking activity in membrane feeding
                    experiments. À clone coding for the entire 24 kDa polypeptide was subsequently
                    isolated. No significant honmology with any previously described DNA sequence
                    could be found; in particular GAM1 is NOT the equivalent in P,vivax of the
                    P.falciparum 25kDa zygote surface antigen. Although GAM-1 seems to be a
                    promising transmission-blocking vaccine candidate, several problems remain to be
                    solved. First,the relation between the 24 kDa and the 57 kDa components
                    recognized by Mab A12 is not known. Secondly, the GAM-1 antigen appears to be
                    poorly immunogenic, as shown by the numerous immunizations necessary to obtain
                    blocking antibodies in mice. Thirdly, only low antibody- as well as cellular-
                    responses to GAM-1 were detected in infected patients. Poor immunogenicity of
                    GAM-1 may constitute a major problem as parasite development can be enhanced by
                    low concentrations of transmission blocking antibodies; in addition, natural
                    infection may not efficiently boost the response to a GAM-1 vaccine.</p>

                    Vaccine- Transmission blocking Antibodies against the sexual stages of
                    Plasmodium can interrupt the development of the parasite within the mosquito
                    vector and thus could reduce or abolish the transmission of malaria in an
                    endemic population. We have identified P,vivax gamete surface antigens which are
                    targets of transmission blocking immunity and cloned the gene coding for one of
                    them, GAM-1. In vivax-endemic regions of Sri Lanka, we have shown that
                    transmission blocking immunity induced by natural infection indeed played a
                    major role in the reduction of the incidence of disease.</p>
                <p>Vhilst progress is being made towards the development of a transmission blocking
                    vaccine, studies on the immunobiology of the parasite ‘have disclosed immune
                    evasion mechanisms. One such mechanism is antigenic polymorphism in natural
                    parasite populations. Another is that exposure to endemic malaria can lead to
                    specific immunosuppression of the host to malarial antigens presented during
                    natural infections; it remains to be seen whether in endemic populations
                    vaccine-induced immune responses would also be subjected to suppression.
                    Immunological memory of the response to targets of transmission blocking
                    immunity also appears to be impaired; natural immunity to sexual stages of
                    P.vivax does not appear to be age-acquired and high levels of immunity depend on
                    frequent infections. Finally we have shown that antibodies against P,.vivax
                    gametes can facilitate parasite development rather than neutralise the parasite;
                    antibody-mediated infectivity enhancement in human immune sera is associated
                    with low titers of blocking antibodies. Transmission blocking vaccines could
                    thus be expected to boost antibody titres in endemic populations from enhancing
                    to blocking levels and effectively reduce the transmission of malaria.</p>

                    determine whether during acute infection with T.b.rhodesiense individuals
                    develop immunity that suppresses the infectivity of the parasite to glossina
                    morsitans morsitans. Sera were collected from 27 patients with acute T.b.</p>
                <p>rhodesiense infections and 34 sera from normal individuals, all living in a
                    sleeping sickness focii in the Luangwa Valley, Zambia. Six healthynon-immune
                    donors served as controls. T.b.rhodesiense blood-stream forms from a patient in
                    the same locality were used to raise procyclic forms in culture. The sera and
                    the procyclics were set up in an immune lysis test. Eight of the patient sera
                    lysed procyclics invitro even after complement inactivation. IgG prepared from
                    one of these sera was as effective in killing as the sera alone. A strong
                    correlation was found between the seras ability to lyse procyclics invitro and
                    the presense of antibodies to T.b.rhodesiense common antigen as determined by an
                    indirect immunofluorescence assay. Two of the patient sera and two non-immune
                    controls were mixed with an equal volume of peripheral blood containing log 8.0
                    T.b.rhodesiense blood stream forms. This mixture was fed through a membrane to
                    batches of 20 Glossina morsitans morsitans. Dissections revealed a significant
                    difference in mid-gut infections in the flies fed on the two diets. This
                    observation that transmission-blocking antibodies are produced naturally have
                    important implications for the epidemiology and control of this disease.</p>

                    338; 585) reported successful vaccination of sheep against infection with the
                    tapeworm parasite Taenia ovis using a defined recombinant fusion protein
                    (antigen GST-45W) expressed in Escherichia coli. Subsequent research has
                    clarified some of the questions raised in this work. The vaccine antigen was a
                    fusion protein of parasite polypetide (45W) with Schistosoma japonicum
                    glutathione S-transferase (GST). lt was shown by SDS PAGE to be unstable which
                    was a major disadvantage in attempts to obtain high vields of antigen for
                    commercial production. The fusion protein has been stabilised by reducing its
                    size. 45W cDNA was cloned into the vector pUC18 and the pUC18-45W digested with
                    the restriction endonucleases Bam HI and Xho Il.</p>
                <p>The purified Bam H1/Xho Il (658 bp) fragment was ligated with vector pGEX-2T DNA,
                    digested with Bam HI and transformed into E coli strain JM101. Expressed fusion
                    protein (GST-45W-B/X) was shown by SDS PAGE to be stable and in subsequent
                    vaccination experiments was highly host-protective.</p>
                <p>Johnson et al (1989) showed that beta-gal fusion proteins with T ovis 45W were
                    not host-protective. |t was suggested that the beta-gal may in some way
                    unfavourably influence the interaction of 45W with the immune system, or that
                    GST contributes positively in some way to its immunogenicity. To test the
                    immunogenicity of the 45W polypeptide alone, 45W cDNA subcloned into vector
                    pGEX-2T was transformed in E coli strain JM101 and the expressed fusion protein
                    cleaved chemically with thrombin to yield free 45W polypeptide. Vaccine trials
                    with the 45W showed it to be host-protective, suggesting that GST had no
                    influence on immunogenicity of GST-45W fusion protein.</p>

                    Cell-Mediated Immunity; Sheep There is an increasing trend towards the
                    development of subunit vaccines produced by recombinant DNA technology and
                    synthetic antigens to protect animals against parasitic diseases, Since most of
                    these antigens are poor immunogens, there is a need for adjuvant formulations
                    which elicit both humoral and cell-mediated immunity. We report the effect of
                    the new adjuvant Algammulin, an inulin-aluminium hydroxide complex, on the
                    cell-mediated and humoral immune response in sheep. Keyhole limpet haemocyanin
                    was used as a test antigen and the adjuvanticity of the new adjuvant compared
                    with incomplete Freund's adjuvant (IFA) and Montanide ISA 501M, While Algammulin
                    failed to induce an antibody response as good as IFA or Montanide ISA 50T",
                    there was an augmentation of the cell-mediated immune response comparable to
                    Montanide ISA 501M and IFA. Algammulin induced much less tissue damage than the
                    other two adjuvants.</p>
                <p>Since immunity to a large number of parasitic infections is cell-mediated, our

                <p>It has been established that, when administered with adjuvant, schistosome
                    paramyosin confers partial resistance to S, mansoni in mice. While paramyosin
                    inoculation characteristically induces a high titer specific antibody response,
                    the immunity stimulated by this molecule is thought to be mediated by
                    antigen-specific CD4+ T cells, probably of the Thl subclass.</p>
                <p>In an attempt to identify which subregions of paramyosin represent epitopes
                    recognized by Thil cells, we utilized the sequence of a paramyosin cDNA clone to
                    synthesize overlapping 15 amino acid peptides which were used in an in vitro T
                    cell stimulation assay. Mice were immunized with paramyosin in complete
                    Freund'adjuvant (CFA) and the draining lymph node cells recovered 7 days later
                    and cultured with the series of peptides; 72 hour culture supernatants were
                    tested by enzyme linked immmunoassay for the presence of Interferon-y (IFN-y), a
                    cytokine characteristically synthesized by Thil cells. Of 44 peptides tested, 12
                    consistently stimulated an IFN-y response. Two of the strongest stimulators,
                    designated 24 and 26, were selected for further study. Single inoculation with
                    either of these peptides in CFA elicited a strong Thil type response to both
                    peptide and native paramyosin. Furthermore, multiple injections of Peptide 24
                    induced mixed cellular responses with the production of both IFN-y and the Th2
                    lymphokine interleukin 5. These data suggest that Thl and Th2 cells can
                    recognize the same peptide epitopes but are differentially stimulated by
                    different antigen presentation protocols.</p>

                <p>Several protective antigens have been purified from B. bovis-infected
                    erythrocytes.</p>
                <p>One of these antigens, designated the 12D3 antigen was purified on an affinity
                    column (using the A12D3 monoclonal antibody) and gave excellent protection
                    against subsequent infection by B. bovis when low doses of the pure antigen were
                    used in vaccination trials.</p>
                <p>The amino acid sequence of the N-terminal part of the protein was determined and
                    used to design synthetic oligonucleotides for the screening of a cDNA library.
                    Several cDNA copies of the gene encoding the 12D3 antigen were isolated and used
                    to produce recombinant antigen by expression in Escherichia coli using a variety
                    of vectors.</p>
                <p>Successful expression of the 12D3 antigen was obtained as judged by Western
                    blotting with the monoclonal antibody.</p>
                <p>Recombinant 12D3 antigen was used to vaccinate cattle which were subsequently
                    challenged with virulent strains of B. bovis. A significant reduction in
                    parasitaemia was observed in the vaccinated cattle when compared with controls.
                    This antigen along with other protective antigens is being tested in field
                    trails as the next stage in the development of a recombinant-based vaccine.</p>

                <p>This reactivity disappeared at dilutions of 1:200, at which asexual antigen still

                    contain specific antibodies against gametocytes, ag vell as antibodies against

                <p>No relation with results in the bioassay vas found. The kinetics of these
                    antibodies might prove useful for the understanding of transmission

                <p>IMMUNITY AGAINST TICKS: EFFECT ON THE SYNTHESIS OF À 25 KDA PROTEIN IN THE
                    INTEGUMENT B.Rutti, M.Mouchet, M.Brossard. Institute of Zoology, University of
                    Neuchâtel, Chantemerle 22, CH-2000 Neuchâtel 7, Switzerland Immunity, ticks,
                    Ixodes ricinus, integument For the first time a protective antigen has been
                    isolated from the integument (allo- scutum) of female Ixodids. It has a
                    molecular weight of about 25 kDa in Ixodes ricinus, and is predominantly present
                    in the endocuticle and epidermis of the alloscutum of engorging ticks. Previous
                    results indicated that this protein plays an important role in the formation of
                    new cuticle during tick feeding.</p>
                <p>Two main questions arise regarding the original localization of this antigen:
                    First, how is the host immune system stimulated by this antigen during an
                    infestation ? Second, how does a specific immune response interfere with the
                    physiology of the tick especially with regard to the formation of the alloscutum
                    necessary for the rapid phase of feeding ? Naive rabbits, repeatedly infested or
                    vaccinated with the 25 kDa protein were challen- ge with I.ricinus. After one,
                    three or five days on the host, partially fed ticks were removed and injected
                    with ?S-methionine into the hemocoele. After three hours incu- bation, salivary
                    glands and intequmental tissue were dissected and homogenized in phosphate
                    buffer. SDS-PAGE analysis of total soluble protein from the salivary glands
                    showed that a soluble protein of 25 kDa was present in this tissue. The
                    experiment also showed that the biosynthesis of this protein in ticks fed on
                    previously exposed and resistant rabbits is abolished. Moreover, by comparing
                    the ratio of incorporation of radioactivity into the 25 kDa and the total
                    soluble proteins from the integument, we found that the biosynthesis of the 25
                    kDa was significantly reduced both for ticks fed on vaccinated and previously
                    exposed rabbits.</p>

                    a Été obtenue par le broyage des GS dans du PBS en pré- sence de 100 m M de PMSF
                    (phenyl. methyl. Sulfonyl. Fluoride). Des lapins agés de 10 semaines
                    (51apins/grpupe) de race New Zealandaise ont été utilisés pourcette
                    expérience.</p>
                <p>Deux schemas d'immunisationsont été utilisés: Les premiers groupes ont reçu par
                    injection sous cutané en deux points au niveau de l'abdomen une seule
                    administration de 2 ml d'Ag (1, 2,5, ou 5 mg/par animal) emulsifie avec
                    l'adjuvant complet de Freund (ACF). Des lapins témoins ont reçu uniquement de
                    1'ACF. L'infestation a eu lieu trois semaines après par 200 larves de H.
                    dromedarii et 40 adultes (20 mâles et 20 femelles).</p>
                <p>- Les second groupe a reçu une injection de0,5mgd'Ag en présence de L'ACF et un
                    rappel 21 jours après dans les mêmes conditions. L'infestation a eu lieu 8 jours
                    après le rappel par le même nombre de tiques.</p>
                <p>Concernant la protection immunitaire vis à vis des larves, nous n'avons pas noté
                    de différence entre les lapins qui ont reçu 1 mg et ceux qui ont reçu 2 x 0,5
                    mg. Le taux de larves qui se fixent et s'engorgent est respectivement 58% et 55%
                    alors que chez les témoins il est de l'ordre de 93%. Cette protection
                    immunitaire dépend par contre de la dose administrée, ce taux est de 19% chez
                    les animaux immunisés avec 2,5 mg, cette protection devient presque totale chez
                    les lapins qui ont reçu 5 mg (seulement 4,5%).Cette resistance immuni- taire
                    n'affecte pas le mue des larves en nymphes mais bloque d'une façon significative
                    la fixation,:: l'engo- rgement ainsi que la mue de ces derniers en adulte.</p>
                <p>L'immunité induite par l'effet de l'immunisation affecte la fixat‘on et
                    l'engorgement des adultes, chez les lapins qui ont reçu 1 mg, le taux de
                    fixation ne dépasse pas 34% alors qu'il est de 72% chez les témoins. La moyenne
                    des poids des tiques femelles engorgées est de 128 mg chez les immuns et 488 mg
                    chez les témoins soit une reduction de 74%.</p>
                <p>Les anticorps provenant des antiserums de lapins immunisés avec une dose de 5 mg
                    (prelèvement réalisé le 18 jours) ont été couplé sur gel. L'immunoadsorption du
                    Broyat total de GS, nous a permis de purifier 16 protei- nes. Leur
                    administration à des lapins à une dose de 0,4 mg/ lapin, a montré qu'elles ont

                    resistance, rabbits, tick antigens The evolution of acquired immunity against
                    I.ricinus was compared between two groups of rabbits: group 1 was infested with
                    25 female and 25 male ticks and group 2 with 5 females and 5 males. Successive
                    infestations resulted, in both groups, in significantly reduced females
                    engorgement and egg mass weights, and in the decrease of egg convertion factor.
                    However, tick-host resistance was expressed earlier in group 1 (second
                    infestation) than in group 2 (third infestation).</p>
                <p>During the first infestation, peripheral blood lymphocyte responsiveness to a
                    salivary gland extract of partly fed female ticks was more effective in rabbits
                    of grouv 1 than those of group 2. But for both groups, a general decrease of
                    reactivity to a T-cell mitogen (concanavaline A) was observed during the time of
                    infestation. High serum levels of anti-tick salivary gland extract IgG
                    antibodies were also detected (ELISA) earlier in group 1.</p>
                <p>These results indicate that low-rate infestations are able to elicite in rabbits
                    efficient anti-tick resistance, but the sensibilization is slower compared to
                    high-level infestations.</p>
                <p>Further experiments are in progress to precise the influence of some tick
                    antigens or sera of resistant rabbits on peripheral blood lympho- cytes and

                <p>Iscoms, Plasmodium falciparum, repeated sequence, immunization, antibody response
                    Immunostimulating complexes or Iscoms are spherical structures where immunogens
                    are presented as multimers in a matrix of the adjuvant Quil A. Iscoms have been
                    shown to enhance the immunogenicity of several antigens important to both human
                    and veterinary vaccine development. We have coupled a fusion protein, designated
                    ZZ-M2, comprising eight copies of the C-terminal repeat subunit EENV of the
                    Plasmodium falciparum blood-stage antigen Pf155/RESA and two IgG-binding domains
                    of staphylococcal protein À to pre-formed influenza virus envelope protein
                    Iscoms. Rabbits immunized with the conjugated Iscoms produced high titers of
                    antibodies which reacted with the EENV repeat sequence in ELISA and with
                    PfI155/RESA in imnunofluorescence on infected erythrocytes already after the
                    first injection. The antibody response, which sustained for more than 20 weeks
                    and was efficiently boostered, was superior or equal to that obtained after
                    immunization with ZZ- M2 in Freund’s complete adjuvant. The antibodies produced
                    after immunization with ZZ-M2 coupled to Iscoms mainly recognized epitopes
                    formed by two or more EENV subunits and were highly specific for PfI155/RESA.
                    Furthermore, the antibodies efficiently inhibited merozoite reinvasion of
                    erythrocytes in vitro, indicating that they recognized epitopes exposed on the
                    native antigen. In addition, the conjugated Iscoms also induced high titers of
                    antibodies reacting with staphylococcal protein À or influenza virus envelope
                    protein. These results suggest that the approach to couple fusion proteins to
                    pre-formed Iscoms has the potential to be a suitable basis for the construction
                    of anti-malarial subunit vaccines.</p>

                <p>The cattle tick Boophilus microplus is a serious pest of cattle in Australia and

                    both directly and as a vector of Babesia and Anaplasma. The advent of acaracide
                    resistant ticks has stimulated interest in the development of vaccines to
                    control these parasites.</p>
                <p>Cattle vaccinated with membranous material from B microplus have been shown to be

                    localised on the luminal surface of the tick digest cells. The gene coding for
                    Bm86 has been cloned and sequenced. The protein is 650 amino acids in length and
                    contains several repeated motifes each containing 6 cysteines which are spaced
                    similarly to that found in epidermal growth factor and several other
                    proteins.</p>
                <p>Cattle have been vaccinated with recombinant Bm86 expressed in E coli. The
                    vaccinated cattle were found to be highly protected from parasite challenge.
                    Approximately 45% of the ticks failed to survive to engorgement, the overall
                    weight of the ticks surviving on vaccinated animals was reduced by 59% and the
                    cumulative weight of eggs laid by the survivors on the vaccinated animals was
                    reduced by 82% compared to non vaccinated controls.</p>
                <p>In vitro feeding and electron microscopy studies have shown that, during feeding,
                    ingested antibodies against Bm86 bind to the antigen on the digest cells
                    resulting in the lysis of those cells enabling the gut contents to leak into the
                    tick haemocoel. This results in the death of many of the ticks, a reduction in
                    the engorgement weight of the majority of the survivors which in turn have a
                    greatly reduced fecundity. If these levels of protection can be established and
                    maintained in the field, the prospects for the development of an effective
                    vaccine against this complex parasitic arthropod are very high.</p>

                <p>Fasciola hepatica, glutathione-S-transferase, sheep immunity Vaccination against
                    fascioliasis, caused by infection with Fasciola hepatica, has generally proved
                    unsuccessful using crude parasite extracts. To develop a defined vaccine against
                    F. hepatica, the efficacy of glutathione-S-transferase (GST) as a vaccine in
                    sheep was studied.</p>
                <p>GSTS of F. hepatica comprise two major components of Mr 26,000 and 26,500. Sheep
                    were immunized with GST and challenged with 500 metacercariae of F. hepatica.
                    Relative to infected control animals, the GST vaccinated group showed reduced
                    anemia and a different pattern of liver enzyme release consistent with an
                    altered course of fluke infection. Fecal egg counts in the vaccinated group were
                    reduced relative to controls. Control sheep exhibited a mean worm count in the
                    liver of 241 parasites compared with the GST-vaccinated group with a mean of
                    107, representing a 55% reduction in worm burden. These results suggest that
                    GSTs of F. hepatica have great potential as a defined vaccine against
                    fascioliasis.</p>

                    general for ungulates has prompted work on the development of a mouse model to
                    evaluate protective immunity.</p>
                <p>Infective larvae of O.lienalis and O.volvulus implanted subcutaneously within
                    micropore chambers into CBA mice moulted to the fourth stage (L4) and underwent
                    limited but significant growth. There was a relatively constant recovery of L4
                    larvae of 33-58 upto 24 days post implantation, with moulting occurring on day 2
                    through to 6 as in the natural host and a moulting rate of 94%. The influence of
                    host genotype and MHC restriction on rates of parasite development is being
                    analysed in a spectrum of inbred mice.</p>
                <p>There is no experimentaï evidence of protective immunity to infection with
                    Onchocerca infective larvae. Therefore, normal third stage larvae (L3),
                    radiation attenuated (20 krad, 40 krad) L3 , chemically abbreviated infections
                    and parasite extracts have been incorporated into a vaccination schedule in an
                    attempt to confer protection against challenge with L3. This simple vaccination
                    schedule is intended to serve as a reference for future experiments with defined
                    native or recombinant Onchocerca antigens which could be evaluated in mice prior
                    to more costly and limited Trials in cattle or chimpanzees.</p>

                <p>For in vivo studies, dilutions of Mab 13.1 were added to blood taken from

                    contain major T cell sites of the P28 antigen. Indeed, 24-43 and 115-131
                    peptides stimulate T lymphocytes from Fischer rats and Balb/c mice immunized

                    mastigophora: Kinetoplastida) and its use as a live vaccine against
                    cryptobiosis. The cloned parasite was attenuated by in vitro culture (at 10°C
                    for 55 weeks) in Minimum Essential Medium with Hanks' Salts and L-Glutamine, 25%
                    foetal calf serum and 25 mM Hepes buffer. The attenuated parasite is
                    morphologically similar to the virulent form.</p>
                <p>It is however more slender, has a shorter anterior flagellum and a smaller
                    nucleus and kinetoplast. Two groups (A &amp; B) of naive rainbow trout,
                    Oncorhynchus mykiss were infected (i.p.; 100,000 parasites/fish) with the
                    attenuated parasite; the parasite mul- tiplied and produced low parasitemias in
                    trout. Group C was inoculated with culture medium. Four weeks later, groups À
                    &amp; C were challenged with the virulent parasite (100,000 Cryptobia/fish).
                    Group B was inoculated with fish saline. Parasitemias in groups À &amp; B
                    continued to be low and the infection lasted about 30 weeks. Vaccinated fish
                    (group A) were protected from the disease and there were no mortalities. Group C
                    (unvaccinated controls) had significantly and consistently much higher
                    parasitemias (30- 1,000 times) than groups À &amp; B. Also, the control fish
                    showed severe clinical signs (e.g. anaemia, exophthalmia, anorexia) of the
                    disease.</p>
